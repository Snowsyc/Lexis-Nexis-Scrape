</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department, New York, affirmed an order and judgment that declared 1975 N.Y. Laws 460 unconstitutional, requiring respondent lawmakers to make restitution of allowances and to pay plaintiff public interest group in a declaratory judgment action. Parties on both sides appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A special interest group brought suit against the New York Senate, Assembly, and Comptroller, alleging that the enactment of 1975 N.Y. Laws 460 was unconstitutional. The court found that the new law provided lawmakers who performed additional services an increased allowance. The court held that N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 6 prohibited the lawmakers from increasing an allowance during the term for which the officers were elected. The court found that the legislature, after the expiration of the express exception, continued regularly to alter allowances through annual appropriations and was a clear and explicit constitutional prohibition. The court held that lawmakers did not have to make restitution of money already received because they had a long-standing practice of passing such increases and had done so in good faith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment and then affirmed it. The modifications eliminated the payment of attorneys' fees to the special interest group and rescinded the order that lawmakers make restitution of allowances that were already received.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Allowances to members of the Legislature for particular and additional services under chapter 460 of the Laws of 1975 are proper under section 6 of article III of the State Constitution to the extent that the amounts thereof do not exceed the amounts &quot;fixed by law&quot; for such allowances in a prior term of the Legislature, and, notwithstanding that allowances have been annually appropriated and paid, thereupon expiring as a predicate for a claim against public funds, they retain a continuing vitality as establishing a level of appropriation for a particular office, which may not be increased or decreased.  Every legislative enactment is deemed constitutional until the contrary is shown, and the courts should show respect for the distribution of governmental powers and restraint in intervening in internal legislative affairs.  The constitutional restrictions were intended to forestall vote manipulation through financial coercion and to avoid conflicts of interest by removing the authority from legislators to vote themselves financial benefits.  After the constitutional enactment, the Legislature continued its prior practice of granting allowances through annual appropriations, and great weight must be given to such contemporaneous construction. Accordingly, the Legislature may constitutionally provide current allowances by annual appropriation without a prospective general law, as is its present practice, if such allowances are maintained at prior effective levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. To the extent that the allowances provided in chapter 460 of the Laws of 1975 exceed 1974 appropriations for like offices or are for offices for which there was no 1974 appropriation, they are unconstitutional, and such violation cannot be validated by the regular annual alteration of allowances in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Legislature must attend to the correlations between allowances in different years free from judicial interference, but the public good and the prohibition against alterations preclude comparison between total, gross appropriations only, since changes in individual allowances would then be permitted, with an accompanying possibility of misuse to influence legislative action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Payments of those allowances which were unauthorized should not be restored either by reimbursement or withholding, since the funds were not for an unconstitutional purpose, but were merely improperly authorized, and fairness and justice mandate that no reimbursement be demanded from those who relied in good faith, supported by long practice, upon such disbursements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. There should be no award of attorney fees from the fund established under section 123-g of the State Finance Law for citizen-taxpayer actions; such awards may only be made from that fund and it has not been shown that such fund in fact exists or contains any money; in any event, such allowance is discretionary. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Informations charging defendants with violations of the Sabbath Laws, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect;&sect; 2-12, were dismissed. The Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) reversed the order that dismissed the informations and reinstated the informations. One defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an employee in a local pharmacy that was charged with Sabbath breaking for selling a ceramic bank. The merchandise was not specifically exempted from N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 9. Sections 9 and 12 dealt with the prohibition against public sales and forfeiture. The court dismissed the information and held that both sections were constitutionally defective. The court held that the collection of exceptions created to the Sunday sales under &sect; 9 ranged from thoroughbreds to soda water. The court held that the large amount of exceptions created to &sect; 9 obliterated any nexus between it and the purpose of the Sabbath Laws. The court held that the proper solution was to declare all of &sect; 9&nbsp;unconstitutional because, if only the offending exceptions were declared void, the general closing mandate would still have remained. The court held that &sect; 12, the forfeiture provision, was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order reinstating the information against defendant was reversed, and the information was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sunday Sales Law -- irrationality -- vagueness -- prohibitions against public sales on Sunday (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">General Business Law, &sect; 9</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> since many exceptions thereto have eliminated rational nexus with statutory purpose and, although judiciary must defer to enactments rationally related to intended purpose, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> encompassing haphazard exceptions unconnected to such purpose cannot be condoned -- entire section should be invalidated, since voiding of exceptions alone would cause general closing mandate to remain and court should not assume legislative function of choosing those exceptions which are proper --</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> forfeiture provisions regarding goods illegally offered for sale (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">General Business Law, &sect; 12</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) are unconstitutionally vague; proceeds of sales of goods forfeited are payable to nonexistent &quot;overseers of the poor&quot; and recipients thereof are unspecified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The prohibitions against public sales on Sunday provided in section 9 of the General Business Law are unconstitutional, since the many exceptions thereto have eliminated any rational nexus between the statute and its purpose.  Although arbitrary distinctions may be part of a rational pattern and the judiciary must defer to enactments rationally related to the intended purpose, a statute encompassing haphazard and anachronistic exceptions unconnected to such purpose cannot be condoned.  Section 9 contains exceptions devoid of reason and erosive of respect for the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The exceptions may not alone be declared unconstitutional, since the general closing mandate would remain, and the court should not assume the legislative function of selecting those exceptions which are proper.  Accordingly, the entire section should be invalidated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The forfeiture provisions of section 12 of the General Business Law, applying to foods illegally offered for sale, are unconstitutionally vague. While the proceeds of sales of forfeited goods are to be paid to the &quot;overseers of the poor&quot;, no municipality appears to have such an office, and how the recipients would be selected is not specified in the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Accordingly, the information charging defendant pharmacy employee with sale of a ceramic bank should be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) which dismissed an appeal from an order granting defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in a one-count indictment of bribery. At the conclusion of the People's case in chief, defendant moved for a trial order of dismissal on the ground that a prima facie case of his guilt of bribery had not been made. He argued that the People failed to sufficiently prove an element of the crime. The court granted his motion and entered a trial order of dismissal. The People appealed to the intermediate court, and it unanimously dismissed the appeal. The appellate court affirmed the order of the intermediate court. Relying on a recent trilogy of U.S. Supreme Court cases, the court concluded that the double jeopardy clause precluded the People from appealing a trial court's order dismissing an indictment where retrial of defendant, or indeed any supplemental fact finding, might result from appellate reversal of the order sought to be appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the Appellate Division, which dismissed the People's appeal of an order granting defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment, was affirmed because double jeopardy precluded the People from appealing a trial court's order dismissing an indictment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where, at the conclusion of the People's case-in-chief on an indictment charging the crime of bribery, the trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that a prima facie case had not been made out, the People may not appeal from the trial order of dismissal.  CPL 450.20 (subd 2), which provides that the People may appeal such an order entered pursuant to CPL 290.10, is unconstitutional as violative of the right not to be placed twice in jeopardy for the same offense (NY Const, art I, &sect; 6; US Const, 5th Amdt) if further proceedings of some sort devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged would have been required upon reversal and remand.

In such case the double joepardy clause does not bar an appeal because errors of law may be corrected and the guilty verdict reinstated without another trial.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, tenants and organizations representing tenants of accommodations subject to rent control, appealed a judgment from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), dismissing a N.Y.  C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding against respondents, Mayor of New York and city rent agency, relating to the Rent and Rehabilitation Law of the City of New York, New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; Y51-5.0(a)(3), (4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners complained that the city rent agency was doing a poor job of issuing Maximum Base Rent (MBR) orders that controlled just how much landlords could increase the rents in rent-controlled units. In affirming the judgment the court acknowledged that the Rent Control Law was inadequate, that the rental housing situation in the city was in desperate straits, and so held that under the circumstances the respondents were in substantial compliance with the law. Respondents were entitled to resort to statistical averaging in lieu of the individual determinations required by &sect; Y51-5.0(a)(3). And the city rent agency actually did not have to audit the books that &sect; Y51-5.0(a)(4) required the landlords to submit for inspection - it lacked the resources to do so in any event. Finally, the delegation of the actual calculation of the new &quot;average&quot; MBR and the corresponding rent increase to the landlords was not impermissible, because this was a ministerial task.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that dismissed the petitioners' proceeding against the mayor and the city rent agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- use by New York City rent agency of average experience of small fraction of buildings involved to arrive at 8 1/2% standardized increase factor as determinant of percentage by which all Maximum Base Rents (MBR) were to be increased was proper; while </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> requires building-by-building basis, judicial intervention will be withheld against substitution of average in face of hopelessly bogged-down system -- petitioners have not carried burden of showing that average fell short of accepted standards -- statutory provision that rent agency require each owner to make available its books for audit does not require that agency make such audit; exercise of right</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> to audit is matter of administrative discretion -- procedure under which actual calculation of average MBR and corresponding rent increase is left to landlords is not impermissible delegation of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The use by the New York City rent agency of the average experience of a small fraction of the approximately 74,000 buildings involved to arrive at an 8 1/2% standardized increase factor as the determinant of the percentage by which all Maximum Base Rents (MBR) were to be increased was proper.  While the statute (Administrative Code, &sect; Y51-5.0, subd a, par [3]) appears to require that the computation must be made on a building-by-building basis, judicial intervention will be withheld against the substitution of the statistical average to avoid a disaster for the people of the city whether landlords or tenants. The rent agency is hopelessly bogged down and it might be years before the statutorily required MBR adjustments to economic change could be put into effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The sampling techniques and statistical methods by which the average was obtained must be sound, fair, representative and designed to produce an accurate result, and petitioners, tenants and organizations representing tenants, have not carried the burden of showing that the average fell short of those standards.  It cannot be said that there was a violation of equal protection because the average was not used in the 9,000 cases already individually computed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The provision in the city Rent Control Law (&sect; Y51-5.0, subd a, par [4]) that the rent agency require each owner to make available its books for audit at least once every three years does not require, as a precondition to the issuance of an MBR, that the agency make the audit. The extent to which it exercises the right to audit is a matter of administrative discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The agency's procedure under which the actual calculation of the average MBR and the corresponding rent increase is left to the landlords does not constitute an impermissible delegation of power and a violation of the tenants' due process rights.  Although the delegation leaves much to be desired as an administrative device, no statute or regulation forbids it.  Furthermore, the landlords' functions are sufficiently ministerial so that it cannot be said that the delegation was unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

There were no limits set on these costs. The court held the lower courts had properly struck down those provisions of the ordinance relating to the board's legal fees and the costs of transcription. N.Y. Village Law &sect; 7-712(1), under which villages set up boards of zoning appeals, did not specify how their expenses were to be paid. While the power to enact fees could be implied, the fees charged were required to be reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of the statutory command. The charges for the necessary engineering and inspection reports and the costs of publishing the statutory notice were not in excess of what was necessary in order to carry out the statutory mandate. Such charges were fairly uniform and predictable. However, the charges for legal fees and for transcribing the record of the proceedings did not represent necessary expenditures, but rather conveniences to the board. Further, such fees were not limited or assessed in reference to other similar cases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The defendant village could not, pursuant to local ordinance, require applicants for variances and special use permits to pay the costs of legal fees, meeting hall rentals and the costs of transcription and copying of minutes incurred by its board of zoning appeals in reaching its determination, and Special Term properly disallowed the levy of such charges against the plaintiff.  Fee structures are usually based upon an assessment of costs of special services against the party deriving a benefit therefrom, whereas the plaintiff was seeking relief from hardship, rather than a benefit.  By failing to specify how expenses of zoning appeal boards should be paid, the Legislature has impliedly delegated to local governments the limited power to enact provisions reasonably necessary to carry out the legislative plan.  Fees should be based upon average costs to prevent a board from incurring costs in an individual case which exceed what is necessary and would be oppressive to an applicant or class of applicants.  There was no basis from which the village could determine average costs and no attempt was made to examine charges in comparable villages or to determine whether the charges would discourage appeals.  The fees charged were not necessary, but were conveniences to the board in discharging its function, and the amounts were not limited by any definite standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Charges for the cost of publishing the notice required by statute and for technical reports were necessary and supportable, notwithstanding that the local ordinance does not set a guideline for the items, since the wide range of instances in which such services are employed provides assurance of a uniform, predictable assessment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In cases consolidated for review, defendants challenged orders of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) affirming their convictions for attempted possession of weapons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two cases involving similar issues were consolidated for review. In the first case, defendant one was stopped by police officers while walking on the street in the middle of the night. The officer noticed a slight waist-high bulge in defendant one's jacket. The officer asked defendant one to unzip his coat and discovered a weapon. Defendant one was arrested for possession of the gun. His motion to suppress was denied. Defendant one pleaded guilty and the appellate division affirmed. The court affirmed holding that the police could approach a citizen on the street for the purpose of requesting information so long as there was a reason sufficient to justify the police action. In the second case, the police had an anonymous phone tip that led them to defendant two in a bar. The police ordered defendant two to freeze, raise his hands, and they discovered a loaded pistol. Defendant two was arrested for possession of a weapon, and after his motion to suppress was denied, he pleaded guilty. The appellate division affirmed. The court reversed and dismissed the indictment holding that the circumstances of the confrontation did not supply the requisite degree of belief to sustain a frisk.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, the court of appeals affirmed defendant one's conviction for attempted possession of a weapon where the stop was lawful and the subsequent frisk was reasonably limited in scope and intensity. In the second case, the court reversed defendant two's conviction for attempted possession of a weapon because the anonymous tip alone was insufficient cause to sustain a frisk.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- police inquiry -- police officers, in absence of any concrete indication of criminal activity, could approach defendant on street for inquiry, based upon articulable reason that he conspicuously</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> crossed to opposite side of street in area known for drug activity when approached by police officers; although encounter was supported by less than reasonable suspicion and would not have justified seizure of person, there was no constitutional violation, absent arbitrary intrusion -- minimal intrusion occasioned by request to open jacket, after police noticed bulge at defendant's waistband, was reasonably limited in scope and intensity in view of context of late night encounter and apparently evasive crossing of street; accordingly, court properly denied motion to suppress weapon seized -- although police had suitable predicate to make inquiry of second defendant, based upon radio bulletin reporting anonymous telephone call that Black male in red shirt had gun in certain bar, there was no reasonable suspicion justifying precipitate frisk, since information was unverified, no attempt was made to ascertain if others met description and defendant did not act suspiciously or appear to be armed; radio bulletin did not prima facie establish reasonable suspicion, since it was anonymous, not personally communicated, and not specific or detailed; accordingly, weapon seized should have been</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> suppressed and indictment for felonious possession of weapon dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Two police officers, in the absence of any concrete indication of criminality, could approach the defendant on the street for the purpose of requesting information.  The police action must be justified by some sufficient, articulable reason, and the fact that the defendant conspicuously crossed to the opposite side of the street after midnight in an area known for its high incidence of drug activity when the police officers approached from 30 to 40 feet away constitutes such a reason.  The encounter was supported by less than reasonable suspicion and would not have justified a stop involving restraint or seizure of the person, defined as a significant interruption with liberty of movement.  The defendant, however, was merely approached and questioned, and, absent an arbitrary intrusion, based upon whim, curiosity or caprice or with an intent to harass, there is no constitutional violation.  More than one half of police work is noncriminally related and the police must be given wide latitude and not be unrealistically restricted in approaching individuals for information in the course of such work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The extremely minimal intrusion to which the defendant was subjected when the police asked him to open his jacket upon having noticed a bulge at the waistband was reasonably limited in scope and intensity in view of the context of the late night encounter coupled with the defendant's apparently evasive crossing of the street. Accordingly, a weapon taken from the person of the defendant was properly seized and the court properly denied a motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although the police had a suitable predicate to approach and make inquiry of a second defendant, based upon a police radio bulletin reporting an anonymous telephone call that a Black male, wearing a red shirt, had a gun and was in a certain bar, neither that predicate nor ensuing events constituted reasonable suspicion which would justify a precipitate frisk of that defendant.  The information was unverified and no attempt was made to ascertain if others meeting the description were in the bar.  The defendant's conduct was not suspicious, and there was no sign that he was armed. The radio bulletin was not prima facie sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion that the defendant possessed a gun, since the source was anonymous and the information was not personally communicated, specific or detailed.  A report of possession of a gun, alone, without any urgency to act or indication of dangerous or criminal use or potential, will not authorize a frisk unless information gained from a prior inquiry supports it.  Accordingly, a weapon seized from the defendant should have been suppressed; and the indictment for felonious possession of a weapon dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) reversed a judgment of the trial court that ordered certain real property of the corporation to be removed from the tax rolls of the city. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that the corporation's real property had to be removed from the tax rolls, having found that the four organizations occupying the real property in question were organized exclusively for religious and/or charitable and/or educational purposes. The appellate court reversed, concluding that the corporation was organized exclusively for Bible purposes and that any religious or educational purposes, or benefits were merely incidental and thus insufficient to secure for the corporation the unqualified exemption of N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 421(1)(a). The court agreed and affirmed on appeal. The court held that a corporation organized and conducted exclusively for the purpose of publishing and distributing the Bible, when neither the corporation nor its corporate activity was directly associated with an organized religious denomination or with an organization having as its avowed purpose the furthering of a recognized religion, was entitled only to a qualified exemption from real property taxation under &sect; 421(1)(b).

Petitioner, a corporation organized exclusively for the purpose of publishing and distributing the Bible and which has no direct religious affiliation or activities, is entitled only to a qualified exemption from real property taxation under the Real Property Tax Law ( &sect; 421, subd 1, par [b]), and, since the City of New York has withdrawn such exemption for corporations organized exclusively for Bible purposes (Local Laws, 1971, No. 46 of City of New York), petitioner is subject to taxation. The term &quot;exclusively&quot; should be interpreted to mean &quot;primarily&quot;.  While petitioner's activities inevitably further the advancement of religion, its charter limits it to publication without note or comment, precluding any doctrinal or denominational position or a finding that it is organized for religious or educational purposes. The purpose of the qualified exemption was to allow localities to reduce an increasing tax burden by withdrawing exempt status, and the Legislature intentionally distinguished between religious and Bible purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The withdrawal of unqualified tax exempt status does not violate due process or equal protection, since there is a rational basis for the legislation and no irrational or impermissibly vague classification is drawn.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner, a nonprofit corporation organized for the purpose of publishing and distributing the theological and philosophical works of and furthering the teachings of an eighteenth century theologian, is not entitled to an unqualified exemption from real property taxation under section 421 of the Real Property Tax Law as a religious corporation, since the primary purpose of petitioner is not religious and neither the corporation nor any of its activity is directly associated with an organized religious denomination or with an organization having the purpose of furthering a religion.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, the former Sheriff of Schoharie County, was indicted in Schoharie County for various offenses relating to the performance of his official duties.  Upon application by the Special Prosecutor to the Appellate Division, Third Department, for a change of venue pursuant to CPL 230.20 (subd 2) on the ground that there was &quot;reasonable cause to believe that a fair and impartial trial&quot; could not be had in Schoharie County, the motion was properly granted and the case removed to Warren County where, after a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of official misconduct. Defendant does not have the constitutional right under section 2 of article I of the State Constitution to be tried by a jury of the county where the offense was committed and, therefore, CPL 230.20 (subd 2) is not unconstitutional.  Prior to the adoption of the Constitution it was recognized that the Legislature could alter the accused's common-law right to be tried by a jury of the county where the crime was committed, and the constitutional guarantee embodies the law as it was when the Bill of Rights was adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Nor does the statute offend the Sixth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, which guarantees the accused the right to a trial by &quot;an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed&quot;, by permitting the Appellate Division to transfer a criminal case for trial in a county other than the county of the offense.  The Sixth Amendment represents a compromise of competing interests and is intended to be restrictive enough to protect the individual from being tried by an alien body, and yet not so restrictive as to deny the Government a forum when a trial is impractical in the county where the crime was committed.  The Legislature is given the power to define or designate &quot;districts&quot; and, while &quot;district&quot; means Federal judicial districts in Federal prosecutions, it is not entirely clear what this means in State prosecutions, or whether it imposes any obligations on the State to create or designate subdivisions limiting venue and vicinage within the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  CPL 230.20 (subd 2) is designed to insure a neutral forum and should not be construed so as to permit the prosecutor to obtain a more favorable tribunal.  There must be at least a reasonable basis for belief that a trial in the county in which the indictment is pending would not be a fair and impartial determination on the merits, and within reasonable limits, the community to which the trial is transferred should reflect the character of the county where the crime was committed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant challenged the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) rejecting her claims that the 15-years-to-life sentence she received for drug possession was unconstitutionally cruel and violated her rights to equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant was tried for and convicted of first-degree drug possession and, pursuant to mandatory sentencing laws, was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 15 years. She appealed her sentence, arguing it constituted unconstitutionally cruel punishment due to its severity and violated equal protection since a dozen others were permitted to pled to lesser crimes and, thus, received lesser sentences. After a state appellate court upheld her sentence, she sought and was granted a further appeal by the state's highest court. That court also affirmed, ruling that the sentence was not unconstitutionally severe since it was within the limits of a valid sentencing statute and, further, that her equal protection rights were not violated since all who were convicted of the crime for which she was convicted were subject to the identical punishment. Court noted in passing that she had declined a lesser offense offer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment sentencing the appellant was affirmed; sentence imposed was not unconstitutionally cruel under the circumstances, given that it was imposed pursuant to a valid statute, and appellant was not denied equal protection of the law since all who were convicted of the crime for which she was convicted were subject to the same punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- sentence -- cruel and unusual punishment -- although other persons arrested in connection with heroin operation were permitted to plead to lesser crimes and were given lighter sentences, mandatory sentence of defendant of 15 years to life after conviction following jury trial of criminal possession of dangerous drug in first degree, class A felony, was not violative of equal protection clauses of State and United States Constitutions; circumstances were not same since defendant was convicted of crime different than that of her codefendants -- sentence of defendant was not so disproportionate to offense as to amount to cruel and unusual punishment -- no inference that defendant was punished because she insisted on right to trial; she received minimum</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> punishment prescribed by law -- defendant was offered three-year sentence in exchange for guilty plea and, accordingly, there was no discrimination practiced against her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, a &quot;millhand&quot; in a large scale heroin operation, was convicted after a jury trial of criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the first degree, a class A felony at the time of the offense, and was sentenced under the mandatory provisions of section 70.00 of the Penal Law to a term of from 15 years to life. Other persons arrested in connection with the same operation were permitted to plead to lesser charges of attempted criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the first degree, criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the third degree and attempted criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the fourth degree and were sentenced to 8 1/3 to 25 years, 5 years and 3 years, depending on the crime to which they pleaded guilty. On the facts the statutes have not been unconstitutionally applied under the equal protection clauses of the State and United States Constitutions.  The circumstances were not the same since defendant was convicted of a crime different than that of her codefendants for which there was a mandatory minimum sentence not applicable to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Regardless of its severity, a sentence within the limits of a valid statute ordinarily is not a cruel and unusual punishment in the constitutional sense and there were no exceptional circumstances justifying a variance from that rule.  The sentence of defendant was not so grossly disproportionate to the offense as to amount to cruel and unusual punishment. Furthermore, the facts, convictions for different crimes and the mandatory statute, justified an inequality of sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It cannot be inferred that defendant was punished because she pleaded not guilty and insisted on her right to a trial.  She received the minimum punishment prescribed by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant was offered a three-year sentence in exchange for a guilty plea and, accordingly, there was no discrimination practiced against defendant in that regard.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After respondent allegedly committed criminal acts, respondent was ordered detained pending a hearing. Respondent brought a habeas corpus proceeding. The lower court ordered his release pending the hearing concluding that the statute authorizing detention was violative of the equal protection clause because it authorized pretrial detention of juveniles with no comparable authority for pretrial detention of adults similarly charged. Respondent appealed. Meanwhile, respondent was adjudicated a juvenile delinquent and placed in a training school. However, the court declined to dismiss the case on the ground of mootness. The court reversed the judgment and dismissed the petition for a writ of habeas corpus holding there was a compelling state interest to be served in differentiating between juveniles charged with delinquency and adults charged with crime with respect to preventive detention, and in the very nature of the process there was no less offensive means to achieve the desired objective.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A determination of the constitutionality of section 739 of the Family Court Act, which authorizes pretrial detention of a youth charged as a juvenile delinquent when there is a serious risk that he may commit a criminal act before the return date of the petition, must be under the strict scrutiny test, since the fundamental right to liberty is impinged upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is a compelling State interest in differentiating between juveniles charged with delinquency and adults charged with crime.  The State is fundamentally concerned with the protection of society from crime and the protection of children in need of special treatment and care.  It may be concluded that juveniles, in their earlier stages of intellectual and emotional growth, are more likely to commit another criminal act than are adults, who are subject to greater self-restraint and the deterrents of second-offender sentencing and the absence of juvenile delinquency treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. No less burdensome means than detention is advanced to prevent the commission of further criminal acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Due process is not violated by the element of speculation involved in predicting the probability of repetition of criminal behavior and, many children being without the effective control of parents or guardians, the Family Court must exercise substitute parental control. While more children may be detained than are ultimately placed in training schools, the determination of placement is based upon the vastly different data available after the dispositional hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Accordingly, pretrial detention based upon serious risk of further criminal activity does not violate the due process or equal protection provisions of the Federal or State Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Since there was probable cause to believe that the 15-year-old relator had strangled a pedestrian during a mugging and, upon a finding of serious risk that if released the relator would commit another crime, his constitutional rights were not violated by pretrial detention. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner revoked the hospital operating certificate of a convalescent home for violations of N.Y. Pub. Health Law art. 28. The convalescent home filed suit to annul the determination. The trial court held that N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2800 was unconstitutional and granted the annulment. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 2800 was not unconstitutionally vague, that it was not an improper delegation of the legislature's authority to the department of health without adequate standards, and that its stated policy, &quot;to provide for the protection and promotion of the health of the inhabitants of the state,&quot; was sufficiently specific and clear. The court explained that N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2806(1) provided that a hospital operating certificate of a nursing home could be revoked on proof that the hospital failed to comply with the provisions of art. 28 or rules promulgated thereunder. The administrative regulations, set forth in N.Y. Comp.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 2800 of the Public Health Law, which declares, as the policy of the State, that hospital and related services be of the highest quality, efficiently provided, and properly utilized at a reasonable cost, and, in order to provide for the protection and promotion of the health of the inhabitants of the State, gives to the Department of Health the central, comprehensive responsibility for the development and administration of the State's policy with respect to hospital and related services, is constitutional.  It outlines a policy, sets forth a standard which is sufficiently specific and clear, and establishes an easily understood principle in a field where a substantial degree of flexibility is required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Legislature has established sufficient guidelines for the Department of Health regarding structural requirements for nursing homes.  Other sections of article 28 of the Public Health Law provide that a hospital operating certificate may be revoked on proof that the hospital failed to comply with the provisions of the article or rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and that a hospital operating certificate shall not be issued unless the department finds that the premises and equipment are fit and adequate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Health provided three possible methods for compliance with the State Hospital Code by nursing homes, the first being compliance by such a facility with specific standards of construction, and this method was unobjectionable.  However, the second and third methods, under which the commissioner could modify the applicability of the construction standards or grant an exception to their applicability, lacked objectivity, and were invalid. They were so interwoven with the valid method that none can stand.  </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 78 seeking relief from regulations issued by defendant deputy mayor. The supreme court (New York) entered judgment granting the trades' motion to convert the action into one for declaratory judgment, granting their motion for summary judgment and adjudging the regulations invalid. The appellate division entered an order of affirmance, and the city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deputy mayor was charged with issuing rules and regulations implementing New York City, N.Y. Exec. Order No. 71 issued by defendant mayor in 1968. About four years later, the deputy mayor issued rules and regulations in part requiring building trades' unions or organizations to accept new minority apprentices at the rate of no less than one minority apprentice to every three non-minority apprentices. The trades objected and filed an action pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78. After the supreme court and the appellate division found in the trades' favor, the city argued the actions taken were valid exercises of authority. The court held the deputy mayor's action went far beyond merely implementing existing state and local law to effectuate equal employment opportunity and in effect mandated percentage employment. Because the regulations exceeded the limits of state or local legislation, if not constitutional limitations, they were beyond the executive power and were thus invalid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Although there is a strong public policy against minority discrimination and, while the Mayor or Deputy Mayor of the City of New York may be empowered to require compliance with section 343-8.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, which prohibits discrimination in employment by city contractors, regulations under Executive Order No. 71 requiring affirmative action in the form of prescribed minority employment percentages are in excess of executive authority under State and local statute.  Within the bounds of legislative policy, the executive is accorded flexibility in determining enforcement methods, and the nature of discrimination requires a broad policy declaration.  Nevertheless, the mayoral policy mandating employment percentages displaces the legislative policy of employment based upon individual merit and equal employment opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The minority employment percentages are not rationally related to cost considerations in government projects, a proper executive consideration, and instead constitute an attempt to promote an extrinsic social policy without legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

New York State law requires that apprentices shall be selected solely upon objective qualifications without reference to minority status (Labor Law, &sect; 815, subd 5; Executive Law, &sect; 296, subd 1-a, par [a]), and such requirements invalidate the regulation which mandates acceptance of minority apprentices by percentage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who were union members, appealed a judgment from the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed their convictions for criminal trespass, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 140.05, for picketing on private property in front of stores that sold the products of their employer, even after the managers of the stores asked defendants to remove their picketing to an area away from store entrances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a labor dispute with their employer, defendants began picketing stores that sold their employer's products. The union had not, prior to this action, applied to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for an order indicating its members had a right to picket on particular private property. When defendants refused to move their picket line away from store entrances, as requested by store managers, they were charged with criminal trespass, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 140.05. Defendants were convicted, and their convictions upheld by the appellate division. Defendants appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that their free speech rights under U.S. Const. amend. I were superseded by the private property rights of the stores' owners and that the owners could regulate picketing. Moreover, because the union had not obtained an order from the NLRB authorizing the picketing, defendants did not have rights under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151 et seq. that overrode those private property rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment upholding the convictions was affirmed because defendants did not have a First Amendment right to picket on private property that overrode the property rights of the stores' owners and their rights under the National Labor Relations Act were similarly limited since the union had not obtained a prior order from the National Labor Relations Board authorizing such conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- trespass -- labor unions -- defendants are not protected by First Amendment from consequences of failure to co-operate with reasonable regulation of picketing outside private supermarkets, since trespassory conduct, not speech, was sought to be regulated -- National Labor Relations Act does not pre-empt enforcement of State criminal trespass </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> against picketers upon private property -- union is not without remedy, since access to private property may be gained if National Labor Relations Board finds it justified upon advance application -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 140.05 of Penal Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is not void for vagueness -- accordingly, Appellate Term properly upheld convictions of defendants for criminal trespass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The defendants are not protected by the First Amendment against the consequences of their failure to co-operate with a reasonable regulation of their picketing outside private supermarkets. First Amendment rights under the Federal Constitution in the area of labor picketing are subordinate to private property rights, except where the employer and property owner has a totality of control, as in the instance of a company town, and, whatever State free speech protections continue to apply, trespassory conduct on public or private property may be regulated. The defendant picketers were asked to move their lines because of their conduct, rather than their speech and were not even requested to leave the area entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The National Labor Relations Act (US Code, tit 29, &sect; 151 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not pre-empt enforcement of the State criminal trespass statute against picketers upon private property of an employer related to a Federally governed labor dispute.  Except as to trespass, where a dispute is arguably within the ambit of the act, a ruling of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), that particular conduct sought to be regulated is neither protected nor prohibited by Federal law, is required precedent to State court action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Access to private property is nevertheless available if the NLRB finds it justified upon application in advance of union action, and the union is therefore not without a remedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Section 140.05 of the Penal Law is not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Accordingly, the Appellate Term properly upheld the convictions of the defendants for criminal trespass. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) that affirmed the denial of his motion for resentencing and his claim that permitting superior courts discretion to afford youthful offender treatment, under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;720.20, while such treatment was mandatory in local criminal courts, violated his equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted, at the age of 16, for robbery and felonious assault. The trial court, a superior court having exclusive jurisdiction over felonies pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;10.20, accepted his guilty plea to misdemeanor assault. Although he was found to be an eligible youth, defendant was denied youthful offender treatment under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;720.20. Defendant moved for resentencing, claiming that &sect; 720.20 violated his equal protection rights, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because it allowed superior courts discretion in granting youthful offender treatment, whereas such treatment was mandatory in local criminal courts. His motion was denied and the appellate division affirmed. The defendant filed this appeal. In affirming, the court ruled that the difference in treatment provided by &sect; 720.20 was not invidiously discriminatory and did not violate equal protection. The difference in treatment between courts was based upon the difference in the seriousness of the offenses over which those courts had jurisdiction and the seriousness of the crime committed by a defendant was a rational basis for youthful offender treatment being discretionary rather than mandatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment affirming the denial of defendant's conviction and denying his motion for resentencing was affirmed because there was a rational basis for the difference in treatment allowed in the youthful offender statutes, such differences were not arbitrary and did not constitute invidious discrimination; superior courts had jurisdiction over more serious offenses and the seriousness of the crime justified the different treatment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 1 of CPL 720.20, which provides that a court in its discretion may find that an eligible youth who has been convicted of a crime is a youthful offender and that, where a conviction is had in a local criminal court, the court must find that an eligible youth is a youthful offender, does not violate the equal protection guarantees of the United States and New York State Constitutions.  The distinction between youths charged in superior as opposed to local courts is not arbitrary.  Superior courts, the Supreme Court and the County Court, are vested with exclusive jurisdiction of the trial of felonies while local criminal courts are given jurisdiction of the trial of offenses other than felonies. The classification in CPL 720.20 is based on the gravity of the crime with which the youth is charged and there is a rational basis for distinguishing between a youth accused of a felony and one charged with a misdemeanor. There is no invidious discrimination in a legislative decision that youths believed to have committed felonies should not automatically be endowed with youthful offender status.  Furthermore, it was proper for the Legislature to decide that, in the interests of judicial economy, it was not necessary to require a time-consuming investigation to determine youthful offender eligibility in misdemeanor cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The rationality of the classification in CPL 720.20 is especially compelling in the instant case.  Defendant, 17 years of age at the time of the commission of the crimes, who was indicted for robbery in the second degree and assault in the second degree, class D felonies, and who entered a plea of guilty in Supreme Court to assault in the third degree, a class A misdemeanor, was properly denied youthful offender treatment on the basis of an unfavorable probation report. Defendant may not reap a double benefit from the congestion in the criminal courts by not only securing a plea to a lesser charge but also by obtaining automatic youthful offender treatment.  </SPAN></P>

Appellant city challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) affirming orders to reimburse respondent second child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child suffered from severe emotional problems and required private schooling. The parents of the child paid tuition for his special education during three school years and the family court only ordered reimbursement by the agencies for one year. The court affirmed the contested appellate division order. The court concluded that the payments for the two years were correctly denied because the claims for reimbursement were not timely presented. The second child suffered from a functional brain disorder and a personality disorder requiring private schooling. The parents of the second child paid tuition for his special education tuition during two years and the family court ordered reimbursement from the city for two years. The court reversed the contested order of the appellate division. The court concluded that the payments for the two years were improperly granted because the claims for reimbursement were not timely presented. The court ruled that, according to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 8, &sect; 200.8(b),(c), for the parents to recover they had to seek reimbursement from the chargeable locality in the school year for which the private school tuition was paid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The parents of handicapped children who require special facilities for their education must seek reimbursement for tuition at a private school in which such children are enrolled from the locality chargeable therewith within the school year for which the tuition was paid.  Under section 232 of the Family Court Act, the court must continually review the condition of the children as well as the state of available public facilities.  The condition of a handicapped child may improve to the point that the child may attend public school, may change so that the child may be more appropriately treated in a different private school, or additional facilities may have been added to the public school system. Accordingly, the court under section 232 must review each case on an annual basis and determine whether its previous order should be amended.  By not presenting claims for reimbursement within the current school year, parents deprive the court of the opportunity for such a periodic review. Later consideration would preclude an opportunity to make necessary changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 232 of the Family Court Act requires that a claim be filed promptly while sufficient time remains in the school year for any change in placement to be effectuated.  A review proceeding must occur while there is time to prevent further unnecessary expenditure of public funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Aside from the requirement of the statute, it is clear that the Legislature intended to provide an orderly procedure for the payment of tuition for, without a limitation of time to make application, local governments and school districts would face budgetary chaos. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. A regulation of the State Commissioner of Education (8 NYCRR 200.8) with respect to State approval of reimbursement to a locality for special educational services supports the view that claims must be promptly made.  Since the claim triggers the payment for which the locality will be reimbursed, the locality cannot receive its reimbursement from the State unless the claim of the parents is promptly filed.  </SPAN></P>

Section 153 of the Election Law, which provides for applications for registration to vote to be made by mail, violates neither section 5 nor section 6 of article II of the State Constitution.  Section 5, which establishes a system of annual voter registration requiring in-person application in villages and cities with populations exceeding 5,000, has been rendered inoperative by the Legislature's utilization of section 6, which allows the establishment by statute of a permanent registration system.  Unlike section 5, which requires that an applicant &quot;appear personally&quot;, section 6 mandates only &quot;personal application&quot;, which may be interpreted to mean that the voter must himself perform the necessary application procedures.  Section 6 of article II of the Constitution was intended to increase voter participation by avoiding the loss of voters who are unable or for whom it is inconvenient to register in person, and the requirement under section 153 of the Election Law that a voter personally complete an application before mailing, having an identical purpose, constitutes a &quot;personal application&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed his conviction for murder, N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.25, after he shot his estranged wife's boyfriend. At his trial he raised the affirmative defense that he was acting under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the incident, which would reduce the offense from murder to manslaughter. Without objection, the jury was instructed that, while the burden of proof as to intent was on the prosecution, the burden of persuasion was on defendant with respect to his defense of extreme emotional disturbance. Defendant was convicted of murder and he appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that, although he had not objected at trial, defendant could raise the issue of whether placing the burden on him to show extreme emotional disturbance violated his due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because the recently decided case of Mullaney v. Wilbur had retroactive application. Nevertheless, putting the burden on defendant did not violate due process since extreme emotional disturbance was merely a mitigating circumstance that did not alter the prosecution's burden to prove intent, which was not negated by such disturbance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment affirming a murder conviction was affirmed because placing the burden of persuasion on defendant to show the existence of extreme emotional disturbance did not violate his due process rights; allowing defendant to establish the existence of mitigating circumstances did not detract from the requirement that the prosecution prove intent beyond a reasonable doubt since extreme emotional disturbance did not negate intent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Due process limitations are not invaded by placing upon the defendant the burden of persuasion as to the defense of acting under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance in order to reduce the crime of homicide to manslaughter in the first degree.  Unlike New York's statutory scheme, the homicide statute of the State of Maine, found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Mullaney v Wilbur</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 421 U.S. 684), has only a single category of homicide, which implies premeditation or malice from the act of killing and allows mitigation, in punishment only, for killing in the heat of passion. New York requires that the prosecution prove the element of intent beyond a reasonable doubt, but permits the defendant to prove mitigating circumstances, whereas the Maine statute makes intent relevant only to punishment and unconstitutionally requires the defendant to negate a presumption thereof.  Extreme emotional disturbance under the New York statute does not negate intent, while heat of passion under the Maine statute does.  The statutes differ significantly and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Mullaney</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, accordingly, does not mandate a holding that the New York affirmative defense is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The finding by the jury that the defendant did not act under extreme mental trauma, affirmed by an intermediate appellate court, is not reviewable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is jurisdiction over the claim by the defendant of deprivation of due process in placing upon him the burden of proving extreme emotional disturbance, although he failed to object at the time of trial.  The distribution of the burden of persuasion goes to the essential validity of a trial, such that the trial would not have been conducted according to procedures mandated by State law if the claim of error were meritorious.  Moreover, the practice which the defendant attacks had not yet been called into question by the United States Supreme Court at the time of trial and intermediate appeal, and he cannot, accordingly, be deprived of the right to have his arguments heard for failure to object to such practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The United States Supreme Court decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Mullaney v Wilbur</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should be given retroactive effect, as was the earlier case upon which it was based.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state taxpayer appealed from the order of the Supreme Court (New York), which declared constitutional a financial emergency statute providing for short-term borrowing to fund appropriations for the purpose of ameliorating the dire financial situation of New York City.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer alleged that the appropriation of $ 750 million to the city of New York and its municipal assistance corporation, to be funded by short-term state borrowing in the form of revenue anticipation notes, was an unconstitutional gift or loan of the state's credit in violation of N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 8(1). The court held that the state constitution did not prohibit the state from giving or lending its money, as distinguished from its credit, to assist a municipal or other public corporation for a public purpose. The court also noted that the state constitution allowed short-term borrowing in advance of anticipated taxes and revenues to fund appropriations previously made. The court noted that the historical impetus for the constitutional prohibitions on gifts and lending of credit derived from the extensive and highly speculative subsidization of private railroad and canal companies with long-term debt obligations. The court held that the only constitutional restriction on the debt obligations was that they be issued in anticipation of revenues and that they be paid off in the next fiscal year, and that the state did not incur further debt in order to pay them off.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- loan of credit -- revenue anticipation notes issued to fund appropriations for reimbursable advances to City of New York and Municipal Assistance Corporation do not violate constitutional proscription against giving or lending of credit of State to public corporations, since cash in hand may be given or loaned, and, where appropriation therefor has been made under balanced budget, funds may be obtained through short-term notes secured by committed revenues authentically anticipated within one year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issuance of revenue anticipation notes to fund appropriations of $ 250 million and $ 500 million for reimbursable advances to the City of New York and the Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York respectively, while reaching the limits of valid constitutional practice, does not violate the proscription against the giving or lending of the credit of the State to public corporations (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 8, subd 1).  The Constitution does not prohibit the giving or lending of money to a municipal or other public corporation, such that cash in hand may be given or loaned, and, where the appropriation for a gift or loan has been made under a balanced budget, the transaction involves cash in hand, regardless of whether the funds are temporarily financed by borrowings. The required funds may be obtained through short-term notes, which are secured by committed tax, Federal grant and bond revenues authentically anticipated within one year and which may not be rolled over into long-term obligations or a new short-term issue.  Such temporary obligations, properly administered, will not burden future taxpayers by the direct or indirect creation of a deficit in the year of repayment, in contrast to the constitutionally prohibited use of long-term borrowing to finance State gifts. Historically, the constitutional prohibition against gifts or loans of the State's credit was intended to protect posterity from the consequences of future contingent liabilities profligately incurred.  The instant transactions present no such abuse, so long as the fiscal prospects are tenable.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), denying defendant's request to compel an out-of-state witness to appear under the Uniform Act To Secure Attendance Of Witnesses From Without The State In Criminal Cases, N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to robbery in the second degree. At the pretrial suppression hearing, defendant sought to compel the attendance of a Maryland state trooper under the Uniform Act To Secure Attendance Of Witnesses From Without The State In Criminal Cases, N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 640.10(3). The trial court judge denied the request to issue the certificate requiring trooper's attendance because his testimony would not be of any determinative value since he did not participate in defendant's questioning. The appellate court affirmed. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed because the trial judge neither acted arbitrarily and capriciously, nor abused his discretion in denying defendant's request since defendant did not meet his burden to prove that trooper's attendance was both material and necessary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- compelling attendance of out-of-State witness -- to be entitled to issuance of process to compel attendance of out-of-State witness ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPL 640.10</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">), court of requesting State must determine materiality of witness; burden of showing such materiality is on party seeking to compel attendance of witness and it must be demonstrated that testimony of witness is relevant, admissible and of significance -- in instant case, defendant has not met burden of proof of materiality as to his attempt to secure attendance of Maryland State trooper at hearing to suppress statements made by defendant to New York police officials; Trial Judge did not act arbitrarily in denying defendant's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In order to be entitled to the issuance of process to compel the attendance of an out-of-State witness in a criminal case pursuant to CPL 640.10, the &quot;Uniform Act To Secure The Attendance Of Witnesses From Without A State In Criminal Cases&quot;, the court of the requesting State must determine whether the witness sought is material.  Unsupported statements that the witness is material or necessary are not sufficient.  The party seeking the presence of the out-of-State witness should present evidence in the form of an affidavit of the witness or otherwise show that his testimony is material and necessary.  The burden of showing materiality is on the party seeking to compel such attendance and it must be demonstrated by that party that the testimony of the witness is relevant, admissible and of significance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the instant case, defendant has not met his burden of proof of materiality with respect to his attempt to secure the attendance of a Maryland State trooper at a hearing to suppress statements made by defendant to New York police officials in Maryland.  He has made only an unsupported statement that there were discrepancies between the testimony of two police investigators, but has made no attempt to point out the discrepancies and no effort to call one of the investigators to testify at the suppression hearing. A request for the issuance of a certificate to compel attendance of an out-of-State witness is addressed to the discretion of the Trial Judge and in the circumstances of the present case, it cannot be said that the Trial Judge acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying defendant's request.  In the absence of an abuse of discretion, the Court of Appeals may not overturn the determination of nonmateriality. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured individuals filed personal injury actions against appellee municipal medical facilities corporation (corporation) and filed notices of claim with the city rather than the corporation. The Appellate Divisions of the Supreme Court in the Second and First Judicial Departments (New York) denied in matter one and granted in matter two leave to serve a late notice of claim upon the corporation. Review was sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals stemmed from the creation of a corporation to operate the municipal medical facilities in New York City. Along with changing the operating responsibility, the notice of claim procedure was changed, requiring filing of a verified notice of claim with the corporation, not the city, prior to the commencement of a lawsuit under &sect; 20 of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation Act, codified at N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 50-e.The injured individuals sought leave to file notices of claim on the corporation, nunc pro tunc. The appellate division concluded that failure to serve notice of claim was a fatal defect. The court adopted a doctrine of estoppel in the notice of claim area, holding that where a governmental subdivision acted wrongfully, inducing reliance by a party who was entitled to rely and who changed his position to his detriment, that subdivision should have been estopped from asserting a right that it otherwise could have raised. To cure the defect, the court held that a motion to file a notice of claim nunc pro tunc was proper. The issue could then be litigated prior to proceeding to trial on evidentiary facts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders of the appellate division were reversed in matter one and modified in matter two and the matters were remitted to special term for a consideration of evidentiary facts as to whether or not there should be an estoppel against the corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The doctrine of estoppel should be operative in the area of notice of claim. Where a governmental subdivision negligently or wrongfully induces reliance by a party who changes his position to his detriment, that subdivision should be estopped from asserting a right or defense otherwise available, and the application of such estoppel to the failure to file a notice of claim may insure that statutes like section 50-e of the General Municipal Law are not traps for the unwary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Estoppel may best be asserted by motion to file a notice of claim </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">nunc pro tunc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, since the matter could then be litigated prior to trial, in contrast to proceeding by way of service of an amended complaint setting forth facts sufficient to excuse filing.</SPAN></P>

Special Term should consider the evidentiary facts relative to the allegations that the corporation and city refrained for a time from applying the statute, that the date of transfer of responsibilities was not publicly discoverable, that the autonomy of the corporation was not indicated in such manner as that of other autonomous city agencies, and that the inaction of the city and its Corporation Counsel is attributable to the corporation.  </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the summary judgment, holding that any claim that she may have had for the benefits under the &quot;Career and Salary Plan&quot; had been effectively waived by an agreement made by her collective bargaining representative and by her own actions. The court held that the retiree, having designated the union to be her agent for collective bargaining purposes, was bound by agreements made by that union on her behalf and further held that she was not entitled reject certain acts of her bargaining representative and accept others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents sought review of orders of the Family Court, Queens County (New York) and the Family Court, New York County (New York), which granted the parents' applications for payment of full tuition for special residential educational training for their handicapped children as well as of all related transportation expenses, but denied their applications for maintenance payments and directed them to pay maintenance expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' children were in need of special residential educational training. The parents challenged Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 234, which authorized family court to direct parents of handicapped children, other than children who were blind or deaf, to contribute to the maintenance of such children in connection with their education. The parents contended that &sect; 234 was unconstitutional because it denied them equal protection of the law. The court affirmed the order below, holding that a rational basis existed for the distinction made in relieving the parents of blind and deaf children from any financial responsibility in connection with their children's education while at the same time requiring parents whose children were otherwise handicapped to contribute to the maintenance component of educational expenses. History and tradition accorded special recognition to the blind and to the deaf in the field of education. In addition, there was no difference in the authority of the courts within and without New York City to direct a parent financially able to do so to contribute to the maintenance component of the expense of education of his handicapped child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders requiring the parents to make maintenance payments for their handicapped children were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- education of handicapped children -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Family Court Act ( &sect; 234</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">), which authorizes Family Court in New York City to direct parents of handicapped children, other than children who are blind or deaf, to contribute to maintenance of such children in connection with their education, not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- rational basis exists for distinction between parents of blind and deaf children and parents of children otherwise handicapped -- historically, special recognition accorded to blind and deaf -- no difference in authority of courts within and without New York City to direct parents to contribute to maintenance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 234 of the Family Court Act which authorizes the Family Court in New York City to direct parents of handicapped children, other than children who are blind or deaf, to contribute to the maintenance of such children in connection with their education, which is free (NY Const, art XI, &sect; 1; Education Law, &sect; 3202, subd 1; &sect; 4403; Family Ct Act, &sect; 231 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, is not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A rational basis does exist for the distinction made in relieving the parents of blind and deaf children from any financial responsibility in connection with their children's education while at the same time requiring parents whose children are otherwise handicapped to contribute to maintenance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. As a matter of history and tradition our society has accorded special recognition to the blind and to the deaf. The Federal Government has also long accorded privileges and benefits to the blind which are not available to other handicapped persons.  The Legislature acted rationally when it took into account historical distinctions.  The State government is not required to withdraw the benefits conferred on blind and deaf if it is unable to provide totally comprehensive programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There is no difference in the authority of the courts within and without New York City to direct a parent financially able to do so to contribute to maintenance.  The Family Court Act ( &sect; 234) expressly grants the authority within the city.  Exercise of a comparable authority outside the city has been upheld as implicit in the power of the court to enter a &quot;suitable order&quot; under the Family Court Act ( &sect;&sect; 232, 413, 414, 416).  </SPAN></P>

The court found that there was a reasonable relationship between the ordinance and the public welfare.

Subdivision g of section 436-5.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, which provides it shall be unlawful to possess a toy pistol resembling a real gun in certain particulars, is constitutional.  The statute is a valid exercise of the police powers delegated to the city (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2; Municipal Home Rule Law, &sect; 10).  There is a reasonable relationship between the public welfare and the act proscribed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The State law (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 265.01, 265.15) does not pre-empt the field of legislation.  It evinces an intent to cover most of the possible categories of weapons for which it deems some sanction necessary when these are used with illegal intent while the city statute is aimed at the prevention of a particular type of abuse.  The one does not depend on the other and they are not inconsistent with one another.  Therefore, the State statute is neither at odds with nor exclusive of the city statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Accordingly, the conviction of defendant, who was apprehended while in possession of a toy pistol resembling a gun known as a Luger, was proper.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant bridge and tunnel authority challenged the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the trial court's judgment declaring that the franchise bus rate applicable to general transportation buses was applicable to plaintiff airport bus company's franchise buses, enjoined authority from collecting tolls from franchise buses, and granted judgment to bus company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the tolls and charges set and collected by authority for bus company were valid. Authority was a governmental enterprise whose purpose was to operate its tunnels and bridges on economic principles, just as any entrepreneur might. Its charges and tolls were not regulated by statute, or by regulatory authority. The legislature lawfully empowered authority to fix rates, without limitation, assuming that economic and political forces would control the exercise of the toll-charging function, subject always to legislative correction if the power were abused. It therefore could charge higher tolls to differentially classified tunnel and bridge users. Authority had this power so long as there was not involved any of the invidious discriminations condemned by statute or constitution, or some utterly arbitrary discrimination not related to economic considerations or some accepted public goal. Bus company's claims of an improper delegation of power had to be left to the legislature. Assuming that authority's power to set and collect rates had to be exercised on a uniform basis within classes of users of its facilitates, it did not violate any classification principles.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which is empowered by statute to fix tolls and charges for the use of its bridge and tunnel facilities, and which has had no limitation placed upon its rate-fixing power by statute or by any regulatory authority, may fix such tolls and charges as, in its judgment, will best serve its economic and public policy goals, and may set higher tolls and charges for some users of its facilities than it sets for other users thereof, so long as invidious illicit discriminations are not practiced and differentials are not utterly arbitrary and unrelated to economic considerations or some accepted public goal.  It could properly distinguish between what it defined as general purpose buses, those franchised buses, whether publicly or privately owned, which are engaged in the general transportation of the public, and special purpose buses, which include those franchised buses which travel between fixed stations to and from the airports, beaches, raceways and sports stadiums, and, based on that distinction, charge higher tolls for the special purpose buses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Assuming that the Authority's power to set rates must be exercised on some uniform basis within classes of users of its facilities, it has not violated any principles of classification. Special purpose buses are distinguishable from general purpose buses, in that the former are associated with recreational travel or with high cost means of interurban, national or international travel, and are used for the special purpose of the passengers, most often without periodicity and at separated irregular time intervals, while the latter are forms of mass transportation from place to place in the course of daily life, usually regardless of the purpose of the passengers. To differentiate toll charges according to the purpose of most of the passengers is a permissible basis.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner challenged the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which modified the order of the trial court in plaintiff's action to have defendant city's ordinance declared illegal, void and unconstitutional by declaring Mount Vernon, N.Y., City Building Code &sect; 21.04(h) constitutional and valid and, as modified, affirmed the trial court's order and judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner argued that the assessment of charges against his property amounted to a private law passed to levy a tax upon his land and that, as such, it was unconstitutional. He contended that he received no notice and that as a matter of due process the assessment could not bind him. The court affirmed the intermediate appellate court's order. It concluded that the assessment was not a tax levy but was enacted pursuant to the police power of the State, delegated to local governments. The court observed that when a local government, in the proper exercise of its delegated powers, summarily abated a public nuisance, it could compel the property owner to bear the cost of abatement. It held that the exercise of police power in issue was not only statutorily authorized but was consonant as well with common-law principles and was constitutional. The court found that it was unnecessary for the city to serve the property owner because at the time when service was appropriate, the city did serve the owner of record. It reasoned that the city was entitled to rely on publication to bind those parties who were not, at that time, discoverable with a reasonable amount of effort.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's order, which modified the trial court's order by declaring a city ordinance constitutional and valid and, as modified, affirmed the trial court's order and judgment in the property owner's action against the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- assessment -- defendant city had power to assess cost of clearing plaintiff's land, where building thereon was unsound and in danger of collapse, against property -- assessment not tax but enacted pursuant to police power of State -- service by city sufficient -- moreover, plaintiff is chargeable with</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> constructive notice of proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Because, as the result of a fire, the plaintiff's building was unsound and in imminent danger of collapse, the building commissioner of defendant city had the land cleared. The assessment of the cost of this clearance against the property does not amount to a private law passed to levy a tax upon plaintiff's land and is not unconstitutional.  The assessment was not a tax levy but was enacted pursuant to the police power of the State, delegated, under the State Constitution, to local governments.  (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2, subd [c], par [ii], cl [10]; General City Law, &sect; 20, subd 35; Mount Vernon City Building Code, &sect; 21.01, subd [d]; &sect; 21.03; &sect; 21.04, subds [d], [h].)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The language of the constitutional delegation of the police power is broad enough to permit the enabling legislation and the local ordinances enacted under it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The power of the Legislature to enlarge the category of public nuisances is not limited to those known at common law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The exercise of the police power here involved is not only statutorily authorized but is in accord also with common-law principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Although plaintiff bought the property after it had been cleared, it was unnecessary for the city to serve plaintiff.  The city did serve the owner of record.  Although due process requires personal service upon owners who are known or who can be readily ascertained, the city was entitled to rely on publication, a form of substituted service, to bind those parties who were not discoverable with a reasonable amount of effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Moreover, plaintiff is chargeable with constructive notice of this proceeding.  The records of the violations which culminated in the assessment are available for examination at the department of buildings and are public records.  They state expressly that failure to remedy the violations will subject an owner to the penalties outlined in the building code, which, in turn, outlines the assessment procedure followed here.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed by permission from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment convicting defendant of possession and of sale of narcotics and related offenses. Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly excluded the testimony of an alibi witness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court excluded one of defendant's alibi witnesses because he had not listed the witness in accordance with N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 250.20. The court noted that a similar notice-of-alibi statute had been declared unconstitutional and the decision applied retroactively. Although the exclusion was error, the People argued that it was harmless error and that the evidence was merely cumulative because defendant's relatives and a friend had also supplied alibi testimony. The court held that an error that involved defendant's constitutional rights could not be considered harmless unless there was no reasonable possibility that it might have contributed to the conviction. Furthermore, the evidence was not cumulative because the excluded witness was more disinterested than the others were and therefore less susceptible to impeachment for personal bias. A new trial was ordered on the drug sale charge only, because the possession charges were based on the result of a search that occurred on a different day, which was not implicated by the alleged alibi.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment by reversing the conviction for selling narcotics and remanding for a new trial on that charge only. The convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the trial of defendant under an indictment charging him, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with the sale of a dangerous drug to a plain-clothes police officer, the court held that certain alibi testimony of a defense witness should be excluded for failure to comply with the notice-of-alibi provisions of CPL 250.20.  Several months after a verdict of guilty, the United States Supreme Court held a notice-of-alibi statute unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Wardius v Oregon</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 412 U.S. 470). Thereafter the Court of Appeals held a similar New York statute unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Bush</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 33 NY2d 921) and later decided that the decision should be applied retroactively </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Morales</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 37 NY2d 262). Accordingly, the trial court's ruling was erroneous and, on the record, the erroneous exclusion of the alibi testimony was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Because of that ruling, the alibi defense rested on the testimony of two of defendant's relatives and a close family friend.  Although the witness whose testimony was excluded may not have been completely disinterested, she was less susceptible to impeachment for personal bias and, therefore, her testimony could not be considered merely cumulative. In addition, the exclusion left a gap in the alibi defense which the prosecutor exploited.  In these circumstances, the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered on that count of the indictment.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Insurance Law &sect; 5108, insofar as it limits the amount that a provider of health services may demand or request in payment for services rendered under the no-fault insurance law, is constitutional; the adoption of fee schedules pursuant to the statute does not contravene the due process clauses of either the Federal or State Constitution.  The purpose of the statute and the fee schedules promulgated thereunder is to significantly reduce the amount paid by insurers for medical services and, thereby, help contain the no-fault premium; the Legislature was acting in pursuit of permissible State objectives in enacting the statute and the means adopted by the statute are reasonably related to the accomplishment of those objectives.</SPAN></P>

In an action challenging the constitutionality of Insurance Law &sect; 5108, which limits the amount that a provider of health services may demand or request in payment for services rendered under the no-fault insurance law, the lower court correctly dismissed all claims asserted on behalf of a fictitious plaintiff, who supposedly represented the interests of those patients whom the real plaintiff, a physician, refused to treat under the no-fault fee schedules promulgated pursuant to the statute, since no valid lawsuit may be brought by a person who does not exist.

In an action challenging the constitutionality of Insurance Law &sect; 5108, which limits the amount that a provider of health services may demand or request in payment for services rendered under the no-fault insurance law, the lower court should not have dismissed the entire complaint for failure to state a cause of action where plaintiff presented a justiciable issue, but should have made a declaration as to the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Insurance Law &sect; 5108, which limits the amount that a provider of health services may demand or request in payment for services rendered under the no-fault insurance law, does not unreasonably impair the right of physicians to contract, since the right to make contracts is not absolute, but is subject to regulation where, as here, the public need requires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurance -- No-Fault Automobile Insurance -- Constitutionality of Fee Schedule -- Vagueness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Insurance Law &sect; 5108, which limits the amount that a provider of health services may request or demand in payment for services rendered under the no-fault insurance law, is not unconstitutionally vague; subdivision (c) thereof states that &quot;no provider * * * may demand or request any payment in addition to the charges authorized pursuant to this section&quot;, and a person of average intelligence would understand that to constitute a prohibition against accepting any payments in excess of the fee schedule promulgated pursuant to the statute, including payments &quot;voluntarily&quot; made by patients.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Insurance Law &sect; 5108, which limits the amount that a provider of health services may request or demand in payment for services rendered under the no-fault insurance law, does not deny plaintiff physician equal protection under the law; unless a suspect classification is involved or a fundamental right is affected, neither of which is true here, the challenged classification will survive if there is any rational relationship between it and the legislative goal to be achieved, and inasmuch as there is a reasonable affinity between the stated legislative objective, viz., to lower premiums, and the means employed to realize it, viz., a fee schedule for medical providers, the statute is not violative of the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurance -- No-Fault Automobile Insurance -- Constitutionality of Fee Schedule -- Right to Privacy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Insurance Law &sect; 5108, which limits the amount that a provider of health services may request or demand in payment for services rendered under the no-fault insurance law, does not violate the right to privacy of plaintiff physician since the physician/patient relationship is not entitled to the same protection as is afforded in matters of procreation; notwithstanding the importance of a patient's decision in choosing a no-fault physician, such a choice simply does not have such an intimate or sensitive character as to warrant protection under the constitutional doctrine of right to privacy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Insurance Law &sect; 5108, which limits the amount that a provider of health services may request or demand in payment for services rendered under the no-fault insurance law, is not unconstitutional since the provisions designed to control the amounts to be awarded for medical services, i.e., fee schedules for medical providers, are warranted as police regulations.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a New York County Supreme Court (New York) dismissed several counts in an indictment brought against petitioners, three state senators, the state senate minority leader, and the minority leader's chief of staff (collectively, the senators), the senators sought mandamus and prohibition to prevent respondent district attorney from prosecuting them for remaining counts claiming conspiracy, grand larceny, and offering false instruments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state claimed, among other things, that the senators' utilization of legislative aides in state senatorial campaigns prior to 1987 constituted an impermissible use of state employees and that payments of salaries out of the legislative budget for their services constituted violations of general penal laws. The senators challenged the applicability of the penal statutes to legislative campaigning, arguing that the prosecution impermissibly intruded into constitutionally protected areas affecting the separation of powers and responsibilities and violated their constitutional privileges under the Speech or Debate Clause. The court held that (1) during the period covered by the indictment, there were no legislative standards, rules, or guidelines regarding the proper duties of &quot;category 3&quot; legislative employees, (2) the assignment of employees to campaign work only was a legislative personnel judgment in an area wholly within the legislature's purview and not subject to judicial or prosecutorial oversight, (3) prosecution would violate the senator's due process rights, and (4) the conspiracy count was also rendered meaningless based on the court's determinations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the application for a writ of prohibition to the extent that the state was prohibited from prosecuting the senators for counts related to category 3 employees, and otherwise it was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. CPLR article 78 relief in the nature of prohibition is available to the Minority Leader of the State Senate, his chief of staff, and two State Senators to prevent their criminal prosecution under an indictment charging them with conspiracy, grand larceny and offering false instruments for filing arising out of allegations that they paid political campaign workers out of the State treasury by claiming that the workers were legislative employees, since prohibition is allowed when a court acts without jurisdiction in a matter over which it has no power over the subject matter or where it exceeds its authorized powers in a proceeding over which it has jurisdiction; where one branch of government oversteps another coordinate branch's functions, a writ of prohibition may issue. Moreover, an article 78 proceeding is generally proper to determine whether a statute has been applied in an unconstitutional manner, and the instant case presents issues of separation of powers and constitutional violations in the application of various criminal statutes.</SPAN></P>

The indictment cannot be legally sufficient if it is based on testimony which may require inquiry into legislative acts or the motivation for such acts, and although Grand Jury evidence is usually viewed in the light most favorable to the People, that rule does not apply where the constitutional rights protected by the Speech or Debate Clause are affected.  The obligation is on the prosecutor to show that no privileged legislative act would be implicated, and the People herein failed to meet their obligation with respect to the activities of three individuals who did prepare reports and arranged hearings on noncampaign matters.</SPAN></P>

There must be restraint on the part of the judiciary in responding to invitations to intervene in the internal affairs of the Legislature as a coordinate branch of government, and there are many activities of legislators, concededly not covered by the Speech or Debate Clause, which fall within the ambit of a legislator's work and are nonjusticiable.

It is not the court's function to engage in such &quot;itemization&quot;, and the failure of the Legislature to act in promulgating appropriate standards governing the duties and assignments of its employees, a matter within its sphere of authority, </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant purchaser challenged the decision of the Supreme Court (New York), which granted respondent auto dealer's petition to vacate an arbitration award in favor of the purchaser. The arbitrator held that an automobile purchased for personal use from an automobile dealer, was protected by the provisions of the New Car Lemon Law, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 198-a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealer argued that the vehicle at issue was not a new motor vehicle and thus the purchaser was not entitled to seek compulsory arbitration of his claim under &sect; 198-a(k). The dealer further contended that the vehicle constituted a used motor vehicle within the meaning of the Used Car Lemon Law, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 198-b(a)(2), which did not contain a compulsory arbitration provision at the time of purchaser's complaint. The court held that a literal reading of the relevant provisions of the New and Used Car Lemon Laws led to the logical conclusion that while the purchaser fit within the term consumer as defined by the New Car Lemon Law, the vehicle which he purchased fell within the definition of a used motor vehicle. The court also stated that a subsequent amendment to N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect; 198-b extending the right to compulsory arbitration used motor vehicle owners reflected a legislative recognition that the New Car Lemon Law did not encompass used motor vehicles. Therefore the court held that it agreed with the trial court's determination that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in rendering an award in the purchaser's favor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An automobile purchased by a consumer for personal use from an automobile dealer, which at the time of its purchase had an odometer reading of approximately 5,600 miles, was less than two years old, and was covered by a manufacturer's warranty, is not protected by the provisions of the New Car Lemon Law (General Business Law &sect; 198-a) and, hence, the consumer may not avail himself of the compulsory arbitration provisions of said law. The vehicle purchased by the consumer fell within the description of a &quot;used motor vehicle&quot; under the Used Car Lemon Law (General Business Law &sect; 198-b [a] [2]) which specifically defines such vehicles as those &quot;which ha[ve] been driven more than the limited use necessary in moving or road testing a new vehicle prior to delivery&quot;. In determining legislative intent, courts should look to the specific statute in question and all statutes relating to the general subject matter, and although the consumer herein is a &quot;consumer&quot; within the definition of the New Car Lemon Law, the vehicle which he purchased was clearly not a &quot;new&quot; car for the purpose of that statute; the vehicle does not qualify as a &quot;new motor vehicle&quot; pursuant to Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 462 (11) and the invoice stated that the car was &quot;used&quot;. Inasmuch as statutes should be harmoniously interpreted, a reading of the New and Used Car Lemon Laws indicates that the former applies only to individuals who fit within its statutory definition of &quot;consumer&quot; and who purchase a &quot;new motor vehicle&quot;. Accordingly, the arbitrator's conclusion that the car in question was &quot;new&quot; was not supported by the evidence or other basis in reason, and the resulting award is vacated. </SPAN></P>

In a proceeding to vacate an arbitration award rendered pursuant to the New Car Lemon Law (General Business Law &sect; 198-a) in which petitioner manufacturer alleged that the statute was unconstitutional but the Supreme Court did not reach that issue, the Attorney-General was not aggrieved by the order vacating the award and his appeal is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

A written application for a transfer order must be prepared, indicating the reasons for the application and including a summary of the appeal procedure, and such documentation would be sufficient to permit review in a CPLR article 78 proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after the police discovered a quantity of weapons in his residence and automobile. The trial court directed that a hearing be conducted with regard to defendant's motion to suppress physical evidence and his statements to law enforcement authorities. Pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 255.20(4), the trial court assigned the pretrial hearing to a judicial hearing officer, who found no impropriety in the conduct of the police. Defendant contended that &sect; 255.20(4) was unconstitutional in that it allegedly authorized the transfer of court powers from constitutionally elected judges to nonjudicial, unelected court employees. The court found no merit in that argument, observing that although judicial hearing officers were empowered to make recommendations, they could not issue binding determinations with respect to pretrial criminal matters pending before them.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 255.20 (4), which authorizes references to Judicial Hearing Officers (i.e., retired Judges) in pretrial criminal matters, does not constitute an impermissible delegation of the County Court's jurisdiction to unelected, nonjudicial State employees (see, NY Const, art VI, &sect;&sect; 10, 11) since the statute provides that upon review of the hearing transcript, the Hearing Officer's report, and other relevant documents and submissions, the court shall render the ultimate determination with regard to the matter.  Defendant has failed to discharge his heavy burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of the statute: there is no evidence that the court's adoption of the Hearing Officer's recommendations constitutes a ministerial formality by which the court surrendered jurisdiction or that the court abandoned its statutory duty to fully and independently review the Officer's report.  Although the Hearing Officer may assess credibility, an issue of constitutional import is not raised because such an assessment or finding of fact is made.  The Hearing Officers possess no power to issue binding determinations, and the court surrendered jurisdiction or that the court Legislature broad powers to prescribe procedural rules for the courts.

The court held that the standard was impermissibly vague and allowed the commissioner and the board unfettered discretion to grant or deny a variance.

The group commenced a proceeding to challenge the Authority's action. The group alleged that the toll increase was null and void as illegal because it was adopted without the Comptroller's participation as required by N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 2804(2), (3). The lower court concluded that there was substantial compliance with the statute and dismissed the petition. The group appealed.

The court noted that local governments did not have inherent power to adopt local laws, and were only able to exercise those powers expressly granted to them by the state constitution or the legislature. If the local government acted beyond the scope of authority granted to it, its act was considered unconstitutional. Finding that neither the state constitution nor the legislature had granted the authority to the town to collect a hook-up fee, the court held that the local law was an improper exercise of the town's authority, and it was properly declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from the judgment of the New York County Supreme Court (New York) convicting them, upon a jury verdict, of kidnapping and grand larceny after they held their roommate captive in his apartment for five days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of kidnapping after they held their roommate captive in his apartment for five days and tortured him. On appeal, defendants contended that their convictions should be vacated because the statutory reference in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 135.00(2) to a place where the victim was &quot;not likely to be found&quot; was either constitutionally void for vagueness or, in the alternative, the victim's apartment fell outside the statutory definition as a matter of law. The appellate court affirmed the convictions. The standard by which the sufficiency of a statute was measured when attacked for vagueness was that it must not be so drawn that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at what conduct was prohibited. The court held that the statutory reference attacked by defendants passed constitutional muster under this test. Additionally, the degree of likelihood or unlikelihood of discovery of the victim's hiding place presented a factual question for the jury to resolve in light of all the circumstances of the abduction and restraint and was not susceptible to disposition as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Appellate Review -- Error of Asserted Constitutional Dimension</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution for kidnapping in the first degree in which defendants assert on appeal that their convictions should be vacated because the statutory reference to a place where the victim &quot;is not likely to be found&quot; (see, Penal Law &sect; 135.00 [2] defining &quot;abduct&quot;) is either constitutionally void for vagueness or because the place where the victim was kept, his apartment, fell outside the statutory definition as a matter of law, defendant never raised those claims either by motion addressed to the indictment or any objection made to the trial court, and, therefore, they have not been preserved for appellate review; because an alleged error is assertedly of constitutional dimension does not create an exception to the rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Kidnapping -- Secreting Victim &quot;In a Place Where He Is Not Likely to Be Found&quot; -- Constitutionality of Locational Language -- Void for Vagueness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a prosecution for kidnapping in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 135.25), the statutory language defining &quot;abduct&quot;, viz., &quot;holding [the victim] in a place where he is not likely to be found&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 135.00 [2]), is not constitutionally void for vagueness since the proscribed conduct, in order to constitute the crime, must be coupled with restraint of the victim for over a 12-hour period; a vagueness challenge must be addressed to the facts before the court, and the void-for-vagueness doctrine embodies a rough idea of fairness.  Accordingly, the statutory reference to a place where a victim is not likely to be found passes constitutional muster where the victim herein was bound and restrained in his apartment for five days while defendants attempted to force him to reveal the access code to his automatic teller card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Appellate Review -- Hiding Place of Kidnapping Victim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a prosecution for kidnapping in the first degree, the contention of defendants that the apartment of the victim falls outside the statutory definition of &quot;abduct&quot; as a matter of law (see, Penal Law &sect; 135.00 [2] which requires that the victim be held &quot;in a place where he is not likely to be found&quot;), since the apartment of an urban dweller is a place where he is most likely to be found, has not been preserved for review by any motion to dismiss or request to charge which might have focused the jury's attention upon that particular element of the offense, which in fact was charged by the court without objection by the defense as to form or substance.  Moreover, the contention is unpersuasive since the degree of likelihood or unlikelihood of discovery of the victim's hiding place simply presented a factual question for the jury to resolve in light of all the circumstances of the abduction and restraint, and is not susceptible to disposition as a matter of law on the instant record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A coalition of residents who lived near the site of a proposed downtown renewal project filed an action against various city officials and agencies and a developer seeking to annul the city's approval of the project. The coalition argued that the SEQRA was violated because the needs of the low-income residents of the area were not properly considered. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city and developer, and the coalition appealed. The court affirmed the judgment because the officials and agencies had not abused their discretion or acted arbitrarily or capriciously in approving a well-considered plan that took many factors into consideration, including the secondary displacement effects of the project on surrounding areas. There was no affirmative obligation to provide for the housing needs of low-income residents because not every conceivable environmental impact, mitigating measure or alternative had to be identified and addressed before a final environmental impact statement satisfied SEQRA's substantive requirements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A complaint alleging that a municipality violated the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) (ECL art 8) by, inter alia failing to consider the secondary displacement effect of a large urban development project on nearby low-income residents was properly dismissed where defendant municipal officials and agencies approved the project after taking many factors into consideration, including the housing needs of low-income residents in surrounding areas; there is no affirmative obligation imposed upon municipal authorities to provide for the housing needs of low-income residents, and judicial review of administrative actions is strictly limited to a determination as to whether such action is arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion.  The municipal agency which finally approved the project has wide latitude in concluding which alternative plans to accept, and mere disagreement with the plan promulgated does not make its action arbitrary, capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence or irrational; the action of defendant agency, under SEQRA, must be viewed in light of a rule of reason, and, accordingly, was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation -- Environmental Quality Review -- Consideration of Secondary Displacement Effect of Urban Development Project on Low-Income Housing</SPAN></P>

A complaint alleging that a municipality violated the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) (ECL art 8) by, inter alia, failing to consider the secondary displacement effect of a large urban development project on nearby low-income residents was properly dismissed where defendant municipal authorities reviewed the draft environmental impact statement, determined that additional information on secondary displacement was required, conducted a survey of the area, introduced new computer-generated data, and concluded that 80% of the residents in the affected area were protected by either rent control or rent stabilization and, thus, would not be threatened with displocement as a result of the project, and that the remainder of the residents were likely to be living in owner-occupied homes.  The fact that defendants concluded that the significance of the secondary displacement was minimal does not mean that they did not consider secondary, long-term effects of the project and the potential impact on the surrounding community.  SEQRA does not require an agency to impose every conceivable mitigation measure or any particular one; the municipal agencies took the required &quot;hard look&quot; at the possibility of secondary displacement.</SPAN></P>

A complaint alleging that a municipality violated the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) (ECL art 8) by, inter alia, failing to consider the secondary displacement effect of a large urban development project on nearby low-income residents was properly dismissed; there was nothing wrong with the use by the New York City Board of Estimate and the City Planning Commission, which were the ultimate decision-makers concerning the approval of the prRoject, of the lead agencies, the City Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of City Planning, as investigative arms during the review process, since those agencies had the technical expertise necessary to prepare the draft and final environmental impact statements.  The environmental impact statements were ultimately reviewed by the relevant decision-making authorities, and the municipal departments merely functioned as experts for the Board, which did make the final determination, as required by statutory and case law.  </SPAN></P>

The county determined that appellant corporation, unlike respondent, complied with the bid requirement of the contractor that they set forth their qualifications and prior experience. The court reversed the judgment, stating that the trial court erred in annulling the county's determination on constitutional grounds because no constitutional claim was raise in respondent's petition, and the lack of notice deprived the county of an opportunity to submit evidence in support of the validity of the local law. Further, the trial court erred in reaching the constitutional issue unnecessarily as respondent failed to comply with the bid requirement, justifying the rejection of its bid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The waste carters began proceedings challenging the rate increase of dump fees for use of the city's waste-disposal facilities.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the collection of increased fees, properly promulgated, and imposed prospectively, for the period that a judicially imposed stay of such collection was in effect, was not a denial of due process.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that, even if it declared the residency requirement of &sect; 503(10)&nbsp;unconstitutional, the members would have had no right to the credit sought because they never applied for it within the statutorily permitted time period.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowners appealed the judgment by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), which affirmed the determination of respondent Commissioner of Environmental Protection (commissioner) authorizing the acquisition of real property by eminent domain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners' property was completely surrounded by state owned forest land. The state offered to purchase the property, but the landowners refused. The state then instituted eminent domain proceedings. The commissioner ordered appropriation of the land, after determining that the property was completely surrounded by state owned land and that the appropriation would accomplish state objectives. The landowners appealed. The appellate court affirmed. The landowners appealed the appellate court's judgment. The court affirmed. The court held that the landowners who had only a life estate had no standing to object because the appropriation was made subject to their life estates. The court held that the state was not required to show that the appropriated land was unique or threatened. The court held that the acquisition of the land to consolidate the state owned forest and protect from further development was a proper purpose for appropriation. The court held that the enlargement to the Adirondack forest was a public use of the appropriated land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment, which affirmed the commissioner's determination that the landowners' property should be appropriated by eminent domain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Proper Parties -- Aggrieved Persons -- Eminent Domain Proceeding -- Holders of Life Estate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding to review a determination of the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation authorizing the acquisition of certain real property by eminent domain, petitioners, the owners of a life estate in the property, are not aggrieved persons under EDPL 207 (A) because the appropriation was expressly made subject to their interest.  Petitioners' exclusive right to use and possess approximately eight acres of the land in question will be honored, and their nonexclusive rights in the remaining 1,055 acres are, in essence, in the nature of an easement over the property for the duration of their life estate interests; as such, petitioners lack the legal power to prohibit general use or enjoyment of the property by the owner in fee.  Petitioners' nonexclusive rights are subject to the fee owner's right to use the land in any manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the rights of the owner of the easement; accordingly, the proposed use by the State as owner in fee, to allow the public access to the remaining property for recreational purposes, does not deprive petitioners of any legal right or unreasonably interfere with their interests in that portion of the property.  Consequently, their petition should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Adirondack Forest Preserve -- Unique or Threatened Lands</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding to review a determination of the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation authorizing the acquisition of certain real property in the Adirondack Park by eminent domain, the Commissioner did not exceed his authority since the word &quot;acquire&quot; used in ECL 3-0305 authorizes the condemnation of land for the establishment of fish and wildlife areas as set forth in ECL 11-2103, and eminent domain may be applied to lands within the Adirondack forest preserve which are not unique or threatened.  Moreover, the absence of a specific reference to eminent domain in ECL 9-0105 (7) does not preclude the Commissioner from appropriating land to accomplish the objectives of the Department of Environmental Conservation of enlarging and protecting the forest preserve, and the term &quot;acquire&quot; as used in section 9-0105 (7) includes the power of eminent domain to achieve the objectives stated therein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Adirondack Forest Preserve -- Environmental Quality Bond Act</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a proceeding to review a determination of the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation authorizing the acquisition of certain real property in the Adirondack Park, petitioner's argument that the power of eminent domain was improperly exercised because the 1972 Environmental Quality Bond Act </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, ECL art 51) envisions the appropriation of land which is unique and threatened, and that there is not an adequate basis to make such a finding, is without merit since the implementing legislation of the Bond Act allocated funds for both forest preserve projects in the Adirondack Park and unique area preservation projects, with the funds appropriated for unique areas being, by definition, for land outside the Park </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, ECL 51-0703 [4]).  By contrast, the &quot;Forest Preserve Project&quot; is a project directed expressly for the acquisition of lands as additions to the forest preserve within the Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Adirondack Forest Preserve -- Constitutionality of Taking -- Increased Recreational Opportunities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a proceeding to review a determination of the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation authorizing the acquisition of certain real property in the Adirondack Park, the constitutional requirement that a taking by eminent domain be for a public purpose has been satisfied since enlargement of the Adirondack forest preserve is a public use expressly authorized by ECL 3-0305 (1) and 9-0105, and legislatively funded by ECL 51-0701 (1); several public purposes, such as consolidating State-owned forest preserve lands, providing additional recreational opportunities for the public, eliminating administrative and environmental problems associated with increased usage of an access road, and protecting the natural resources of the property from further development, are accomplished by the appropriation in question.  Moreover, the appropriation in fee, instead of some less restrictive means, was necessary to effectuate the objectives enumerated in ECL 9-0105 (7), and the appropriation was supported by an adequate basis and has not been shown to be unreasonable or arbitrary.  </SPAN></P>

Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 8, &sect; 175.35(e)(1)(i)&nbsp;unconstitutional, and limited its judgment to prospective effect only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organizations challenged the Commissioner's regulation implementing the excellence in teaching (EIT) set-aside grants.

The lower court granted the organizations' motion for summary judgment, declaring &sect; 175.35(e)(1)(i) invalid, but limiting its judgment to prospective effect only. The parties cross appealed. The court held that: (1) the challenged regulation violated equal protection because similarly situated educators were treated differently with regard to EIT set-aside fund eligibility based on how their salary was characterized, which was directly related to the collective bargaining process, a factor that was an unwarranted basis for classification; and (2) because of the demonstrated hardship and fiscal confusion that would result from retroactive application of the declaration of invalidity, the judgment would be prospective only.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Teachers -- Excellence in Teaching Funds -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A regulation of the Commissioner of Education (8 NYCRR 175.35 [e] [1] [i]), which attempted to implement the excellence in teaching (EIT) program, whereby funds would be provided to augment the salaries of deserving teachers, is unconstitutional as violative of equal protection, where the regulation provides that mentor teachers and others providing educational services under a nonadministrative teaching certificate who are compensated under a teachers' salary schedule are eligible for EIT funds, but those compensated under an administrative or supervisory salary or salary schedule are not eligible. However, the fact that administrators and supervisors generally are paid higher salaries than teachers does not alter the fact that similarly situated educators are not subject to similar EIT fund eligibility for any logical reason; rather, the distinctions are based on the fortuities of how a person's salary is characterized, which is directly related to the collective bargaining process, a factor previously held to be an unwarranted basis for classification for EIT fund eligibility. Moreover, although some professional educators paid under an administrator's salary schedule will be eligible for EIT funds despite the language of the regulation to the contrary, other professional educators who provide comparable educational services but are paid an administrator's salary will not be eligible; such distinctions defy logic and are not constitutionally permissible. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed from an order of the Supreme Court (New York), which granted defendant tax commissioner's motion to dismiss the complaints in the property owners' consolidated actions for judgments declaring that the partial and successive transfers of properties owned by plaintiffs were not subject to aggregation for taxation purposes pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law &sect;1440(7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners owned two large tracts of land that they were developing as industrial parks. They had sold separate portions of the tracts for various prices which, in the aggregate, amount to more than $ 1 million for each property owner. The tax commission assessed the transfers in the aggregate under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1440(7) as transfers pursuant to a plan or agreement and subject to the gains tax. The property owners paid the gains taxes and filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment. The trial court dismissed their complaints. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the property owners had the burden of proof to overcome the tax assessments, and that the tax commission's determination that the sales were in pursuit of a plan to develop industrial parks was a reasonable interpretation of the statutes and regulations. The court concluded that the property owners' statements that their sales were not in pursuit of plans were insufficient. The court found that the heavy tax burden placed on the property owners as opposed to residential property owners was justified by the substantial burdens placed on the governments by the development of the industrial parks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The partial and successive transfers of certain real property owned by plaintiffs are subject to aggregation for taxation purposes pursuant to the real property transfer gains tax </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Tax Law &sect; 1440 [7]) where the parcels are zoned for industrial use, each plaintiff is preparing the land for use as industrial parks, portions of the parcels have been sold to separate unrelated purchasers for various prices under $ 1,000,000, and the aggregate of the consideration of the transfers was in excess of $ 1,000,000, since the determination of the State Tax Commission that a common purpose was the operative factor in all of the transfers and that tax avoidance was the ultimate goal was supported by substantial evidence; plaintiffs are admittedly engaged in developing industrial parks and the Commission found that their assertion that they have no &quot;plan&quot; to effectuate transfers in avoidance of the tax because their transfers were to separate and unrelated transferees lacked credibility.  The tax may not be avoided merely by filing a statement that the transferor is not acting pursuant to a plan to avoid the tax since interpreting the statute in that manner would not further the legislative purpose of taxing large real estate transactions.  Plaintiffs have failed to sustain their heavy burden of showing that the gains tax statute is arbitrary or that it invidiously discriminates against them since every property owner in their situation is treated similarly, and the fact that residential and industrial properties are treated differently is justifiable given the substantial burdens placed upon local and State governments by the development of large industrial complexes.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant proposed adoptive parents appealed the order from the Family Court, Westchester County (New York), which denied their petition for adoption of an infant on the ground that respondent natural father's consent was required because the natural father had sufficiently met the requirements of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The natural father and respondent natural mother were unmarried and not cohabitating when the infant was born. Three days before the natural mother executed the consent to adoption, the natural father began a custody proceeding. A filiation order was entered a month later. The natural parents married, and the natural mother joined in the custody action. The natural parents opposed the adoption on the grounds that the natural father's consent to the adoption was required and the natural mother's consent was invalid. The trial court bifurcated the hearing and limited the evidence to the issue of whether the natural father's consent was required. The court reversed the order denying the adoption and remanded for determination of the validity of the natural mother's consent. The court held that the criteria set forth in N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 111(1)(e) were mandatory, that the consent of the natural father was not required because he failed to satisfy those criteria, that &sect; 111(1)(e) satisfied the constitutional test for a gender-based classification, and that the natural parents' subsequent marriage did not operate retroactively so as to require the natural father's consent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent -- Natural Father -- Failure to Meet Statutory Criteria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The consent of a natural father to the proposed adoption of his infant daughter is not required pursuant to Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (e) where the father did not marry the child's mother until more than five months after the child's birth and more than three months after her placement for adoption, since the father failed to satisfy the statutory criterion that he openly lived with the child or the child's mother for a continuous period of six months immediately preceding the placement of the child for adoption; inasmuch as the subject child was placed for adoption before she was six months old, section 111 (1) (e) applies and its criteria setting forth the conditions which an unmarried natural father must satisfy are mandatory.  The statute has been held to be constitutional for it provides logical, objective and eminently sound indicia by which to determine whether an unmarried father has manifested the intent to establish a substantial familial relationship with an infant born out of wedlock, thereby justifying the gender-based classification.  Moreover, given the lack of evidence that the natural father herein took meaningful steps to establish a family unit, it need not be decided if something less than total compliance with the three criteria listed in the statute may satisfy the law and require an unmarried father's consent to an adoption; the record overwhelmingly demonstrates that even under a relaxed interpretation of the statute, the natural father's efforts to establish a substantial family relationship were woefully inadequate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent -- Natural Father -- Subsequent Marriage to Natural Mother</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The consent of a natural father to the proposed adoption of his infant daughter is not required where the father failed to satisfy the criteria listed in Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (e), and the fact that the father married the natural mother some five months after the child's birth and three months after her placement for adoption does not operate to require that the consent of the natural father be given for the adoption to proceed; to require consents from later-married natural fathers would render the statutory provisions meaningless and create uncertainty in adoption proceedings by permitting unwed parents to marry at any point prior to an adoption being finalized and thereby acquire the power to veto the proposed adoption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent -- Bifurcated Hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an adoption proceeding, Family Court improvidently exercised its discretion in ordering a bifurcated hearing to determine whether the natural father's consent to the adoption was required before receiving evidence on the question of the validity of the natural mother's consent, which was also in issue.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents sought review of the decision of the Supreme Court (New York), which granted respondent school district summary judgment in the parents' cause of action to prevent the mandatory attendance of their children in AIDS and alcohol and drug abuse instructional classes as violative of their rights under U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents sought a total exemption from the school's curriculum on the grounds that it violated their right to a free exercise of their religion under U.S. Const. amend. I, and their implied right of privacy to raise their children in accordance with their religious beliefs. The school district argued that the mere exposure of the children to the contested material did not constitute a violation of the parents' free exercise rights, and even if it did, the state had a compelling interest in educating citizens in ways to protect themselves from the dangers of AIDS and alcohol and drug abuse. The court modified the judgment, but only to append a declaration that the statute was not unconstitutional. The court determined that the compulsory education material could place a limited burden on the parents' free exercise rights because even fundamental rights such as those under the First Amendment could be impinged upon through the least restrictive means if the state posited a compelling state interest. In light of the numerous compelling state interests in this case, the court ruled that the parents' religious freedom was not impermissibly infringed upon by the contested curriculum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Education requiring all primary and secondary school students to receive instruction with regard to AIDS, and alcohol and drug abuse (8 NYCRR 135.3 [b] [2]; [c] [2]) do not impermissibly infringe on the First Amendment rights of petitioners to freely exercise their religious beliefs; although petitioners' religious beliefs require them to remain &quot;simple as to evil&quot; and distance themselves from all perceived evil, and although the compulsory education in issue may violate their First Amendment rights, even fundamental rights may be impinged upon through the least restrictive means when, in so doing, the State is advancing a compelling interest which is essential to the accomplishment of an overriding governmental purpose, and the compulsory health education curriculum clearly meets the test of advancing several compelling State interests, viz., the education of its citizens and the protection of the public health from the very real and dangerous AIDS crisis. Petitioners' invocation of their implied fundamental right of privacy is unavailing since uncontradicted religious indoctrination which denies the existence of undeniable health crises does not provide a suitable alternative to education where there is a very real likelihood that disaffected members of petitioners' sect will either leave or be cast out into society ignorant of AIDS and its methods of transmission and prevention, thereby becoming a risk to the public health. </SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that the U.S. Const. amend. VI right to assistance of counsel required issuance of a subpoena. The reviewing court found no possibility of imprisonment and no right to counsel, and also ruled that the bureau could not negate the authority of courts to issue a subpoena. The court held that no essential element of a fair trial could be dispensed with unless waived, even in administrative or quasi-judicial proceedings, and defendant should have been fully apprised of the claims against him and the evidence considered, and should have been given the opportunity to cross examine witnesses, inspect documents, and offer evidence in explanation or rebuttal.</SPAN></P>

Although 15 NYCRR 123.1 states that &quot;The [CPLR] and [CPL] are not binding on [the Traffic Violations] bureau&quot;, that regulation cannot be read to invalidate every provision of the CPLR when one considers that the subpoena power invoked herein does not in any way infringe upon the Traffic Violations Bureau, does not regulate or otherwise interfere with the proceedings of the Bureau, or direct the Bureau to act or refrain from acting in a particular way.  Defendant is not seeking pretrial discovery, and is entitled to the production at the hearing itself, not beforehand, of the very item upon which the People rely in bringing the speeding charge; the materials in question should only be turned over immediately prior to the commencement of cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

The Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel does not require the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum requiring a police department to produce at defendant's hearing on a speeding charge the radar device which allegedly detected his speeding and all documents pertaining to the maintenance of the device, since there is no Sixth Amendment right to counsel in a case in which a defendant is charged with a traffic infraction; a traffic infraction is not a crime and the resultant penalty upon conviction cannot be deemed a penal punishment </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 155).

Inasmuch as some inmates are capable of adapting FM radios to monitor, intercept or otherwise interfere with prison radio transmissions, there is a clear and logical connection between their prohibition and the valid governmental interest of promoting prison management and security; banning the use of A/C adaptors is justified by the legitimate goal of minimizing the danger of fires, overloaded circuits, power failures, etc., and inasmuch as the ban is not unconditional, it accomplishes the stated goals in a reasonable and nonintrusive manner; the value limitation on radios is reasonably and inexorably related to the maintenance of prison security, order and discipline by deterring theft.  Moreover, the directives are content-neutral, there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of the justifications advanced by respondents, and courts should not invade the province of correctional authorities in administering prisons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer challenged a determination of defendant, the Commissioner of the Department of Finance of the City of New York (commissioner), denying the taxpayer a refund of a real estate transfer tax payment on a building the taxpayer purchased in Manhattan from the United States. Although normally the seller would have been liable for the tax, the United States was exempt, and thus the tax fell to the purchaser as a non-exempt grantee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer paid the municipal real property transfer tax on a building bought from the United States to the city under protest, and then sought a refund, which the commissioner denied in an administrative hearing. The taxpayer contended that granting an exemption for grantees of the United Nations (UN) and educational, charitable, and other like institutions, while taxing grantees of the United States, constituted a violation of the Supremacy Clause. The court affirmed the commissioner's determination, finding no discriminatory treatment of the United States and its agencies because the tax treated the United States the same as state governmental units. In addition, the taxpayer's claim that the city administered the tax so as to give preferential treatment to those dealing with the city, as compared with those doing business with the United States, was rejected because it was not raised at the administrative hearing. Further, the single such instance cited by the taxpayer did not in any case establish the existence of a consistent city policy of favoring city grantees and discriminatorily taxing federal grantees.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, the assertion that &quot;discrimination&quot; occurs when grantees of the UN or other similar organizations are exempted from the tax while grantees of the United States are not is without merit since it is reasonable for the city to place such organizations in the same category as eleemosynary institutions, and exempting such organizations furthers the public policy of the United States as host country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured party challenged the decision of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York), which denied his motion to compel defendant general contractor to be deposed, denied the injured party's motion to compel third-party defendant employer to respond to his interrogatories, and denied the injured party's motion for authorization for his attorney to conduct ex parte interviews of nonmanagerial employees of the employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that it was not proper for opposing counsel or its investigator to contact ex parte an employee of a corporation that was a party to an action knowing that the information sought from the employee related to a subject of controversy. Only by viewing all present employees of a corporation as &quot;parties&quot; might the terms of N.Y. Jud. App., Code Prof. Resp. DR 7-104(A)(1) effectively be enforced. Neither the federal constitution nor the state constitution secured a right to attorneys who were actively involved in litigation to conduct ex parte examinations of the employees of adverse parties.Thus, the injured party's attorney was not allowed to conduct ex parte interviews of the employer's nonmanagerial employees. The injured party's claim under N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 240 was not the equivalent of liability premised on proof of actual negligence. Thus, because the action was not predicated solely on negligence, interrogatories were authorized. The court found that the &quot;leave of court&quot; authorized by the terms of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3130 should have been granted because the courts should not be reluctant to authorize the use of interrogatories even where depositions had been held.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court deleted the provisions of the trial court's order that denied the injured party's motion to compel the general contractor to submit to a deposition and to compel the employer to respond to the injured party's interrogatories and that prohibited the injured party from conducting ex parte interviews of persons who were not currently employed by any adverse party represented by an attorney. The court affirmed the order as modified.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney and Client -- Communication with Adverse Party -- Ex Parte Communication with Employees of Adverse Corporation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An attorney for plaintiff in a personal injury action may not communicate on an ex parte basis with certain individuals who, as employees of a corporate third-party defendant, are presumptively within the scope of the representation afforded by the attorneys who appeared on behalf of that corporation, since Code of Professional Responsibility DR 7-104 (A) (1) prohibits a lawyer from communicating with an adverse party whom he knows to be represented by an attorney in connection with the subject matter of that representation.  Plaintiff's contention that such ex parte communications should be permitted is premised on an invalid assumption, viz., that the attorneys who represent the corporate third-party defendant do not in fact represent its employees; however, unless there is proof that the scope of the representation is more limited, it must be presumed that such representation extends not only to the corporation but to every current agent or employee thereof who is connected in any way with the instant action.  Plaintiff's argument that the ethical prohibition on ex parte communications extends only to members of the corporation's &quot;control group&quot; or &quot;alter ego&quot; is theoretically unsound and practically unworkable: there is no test by which to differentiate between those employees who could not be contacted ex parte and those who could, and attempts to make that differentiation would lead to a flood of pretrial litigation.  Plaintiff's attorneys herein properly sought an advance ruling before attempting to communicate with the third-party defendant's employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Disclosure -- Interrogatories -- Use of Both Interrogatories and Depositions in Action Based on Negligence and Strict Liability</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action based on negligence and the strict liability provisions of Labor Law &sect; 240, plaintiff may seek pretrial disclosure from defendants both by conducting depositions and by serving interrogatories since CPLR 3130 (1) provides that use of both disclosure devices is precluded &quot;solely on a cause * * * of action for negligence&quot; and that statutory phrase should be given a literal construction; an action based on a claimed violation of section 240 is substantively different from an action based on negligence.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the judgments of the Supreme Court of Queens County (New York) convicting them of manslaughter in the second degree, assault in the first degree, and conspiracy in the fifth degree, claiming that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions, that their inculpatory statements should have been suppressed, and that it was error to require the defense to articulate race-neutral reasons for peremptory challenges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged their convictions for manslaughter, assault, and conspiracy in a racial attack that led to the death of a black man who was chased onto a freeway and killed by a car. Defendants argued that the evidence was legally insufficient to support their convictions, that their inculpatory statements to police should have been suppressed, and that the trial court erred in ruling that the defense, in exercising its peremptory challenges, was required to articulate a race-neutral explanation for challenges to black jurors. The appellate court affirmed the convictions after finding that the evidence was legally sufficient, that the hearing court did not err in denying the suppression of their statements, and that appellants were not prejudiced by the trial court's &quot;reverse-Batson&quot; ruling since the only black juror seated as a result of the failure to provide a race-neutral reason was excused prior to jury deliberations. Nevertheless, the court held that the trial court's &quot;reverse-Batson&quot; ruling was proper because racial discrimination, whether by the prosecution or the defense, was not countenanced, either substantively or procedurally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the evidence adduced at trial established that appellants created a grave risk of death that they consciously disregarded, and by doing so grossly deviated from the standard of conduct reasonable persons would have observed, the court affirmed the convictions, holding that the trial court's rulings were proper in all respects.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Manslaughter -- Victim Killed by Car after Being Chased onto Highway -- Conscious Disregard of Risk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution of three youths who were charged with causing the death of a man by chasing him with bats and clubs onto a six-lane highway where he was struck and killed by an automobile, the evidence was legally sufficient to establish defendants' guilt of manslaughter in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 125.15 [1]), since, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have concluded that defendants, who were thoroughly familiar with the area in which the crime occurred, were aware that their actions in continuing to chase and threaten the victim as he ran to the end of a street, leaped over a barricade, and ran onto the highway, created a grave risk of death to the victim, which risk defendants were aware of and consciously chose to disregard; the victim had been physically threatened in the dark morning hours in an area unfamiliar to him, and the evidence clearly established that defendants did not abandon their chase once they reached the end of the street. Rather, the evidence showed that defendants did not stop their pursuit until they saw the victim hit by the car, and the jury could readily conclude that defendants' continued hot pursuit of the victim as he fled onto the highway amounted to a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would have observed under the circumstances </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Penal Law &sect; 15.05 [3]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Manslaughter -- Victim Killed by Car after Being Chased onto Highway -- &quot;Sufficiently Direct Cause&quot; of Death</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a prosecution of three youths who were charged with causing the death of a man by chasing him with bats and clubs onto a six-lane highway where he was struck and killed by an automobile, defendants' actions were a &quot;sufficiently direct cause&quot; of the victim's death so as to warrant the imposition of criminal liability, since the only reasonable alternative left open to the victim was to seek safety by crossing the highway; it cannot be said that defendants' despicable conduct was not a sufficiently direct cause of death, and defendants will not be heard to complain that, in desperately fleeing their murderous assault, the victim chose the wrong escape route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Manslaughter -- Victim Killed by Car after Being Chased onto Highway -- Intervening Cause</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a prosecution of three white youths who were charged with causing the death of a black man by chasing him with bats and clubs onto a six-lane highway where he was struck and killed by an automobile, the alleged negligent operation of the vehicle was not an intervening proximate cause of death where, given the fact that the crime occurred during the night and the victim was fleeing from a mob of approximately 12 white youths shouting racial epithets and demanding that he get out of &quot;their&quot; neighborhood, it cannot be said that an intervening wrongful act occurred to relieve defendants from the directly foreseeable consequences of their actions.  Even assuming that the operator of the vehicle was less than cautious, the facts demonstrate that his actions were not the sole cause of death since it was defendants' wrongful conduct which forced the victim to seek refuge from his assailants by crossing the highway. Moreover, although there was some evidence that the victim may have been under the influence of cocaine when he died, there was more than sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that the victim was not under the influence of cocaine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Assault -- Evidence of Serious Physical Injury</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a criminal prosecution arising out of an attack by a mob on an unarmed victim, the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the three defendants' convictions for assault in the first degree since the prosecution established that the victim sustained &quot;serious physical injury&quot; as a result of the beating he received </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Penal Law &sect; 120.10 [1]; &sect; 10.00 [10]); the victim was struck repeatedly with bats and clubs, and sustained numerous contusions, a laceration requiring five stitches, and a hematoma.  One month after the beating, the victim still showed signs of injury.  Viewing the testimony of the victim and various physicians in the light most favorable to the People, it must be concluded that the evidence was legally sufficient to establish that the victim sustained serious physical injury which impaired his vision and produced back spasms, and that the victim suffered a protracted impairment of his health.  Moreover, a review of the facts </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, CPL 470.15 [1]) leads to the conclusion that the jury's verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the credible evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Confession -- Isolation of Youthful Defendant from Parents or Attorney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a criminal prosecution in which the 16-year-old defendant contended that his custodial confession was extracted from him after the police effectively cut off all of his avenues of assistance by taking him to one precinct rather than to another, the hearing court properly determined that the facts do not support a finding that the police acted in such a way as to purposely isolate defendant from his parents or his attorney, where a change in the police officers' plans resulted in defendant not being taken to the precinct where his mother was told he would be, after defendant indicated a willingness to cooperate and view photographs; his statements were made prior to the time that the police were advised that he was represented by counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Confession -- Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Appellate Review -- Reopening of Suppression Hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In a criminal prosecution in which the 17-year-old defendant contended that his custodial statements to the police should be suppressed since the officers failed to scrupulously honor his right to remain silent, to the extent that defendant's claims asserted on appeal are premised upon arguments and testimony which were not presented to the suppression court, they are not preserved for appellate review; once certain evidence purportedly favorable to the defense came to light during the trial, it was incumbent on defendant to seek to reopen the suppression hearing for the purpose of inquiring into the circumstances of his interrogation and no such request was made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Confession -- Waiver of Right to Remain Silent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In a criminal prosecution, the 17-year-old defendant's motion to suppress his custodial statements to the police was properly denied where the evidence showed that both defendant and his father freely and voluntarily accompanied police officers to the precinct, that the police did not consider defendant to be a suspect at that time, that once the police were made aware of the fact that defendant had been identified as a participant in the crime they were investigating, he was immediately advised of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights in his father's presence, with both defendant and his father signing a written waiver of those rights, and that defendant thereafter provided the police with an oral and written statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Confession -- Provocation of Statement from Defendant by Police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In a criminal prosecution arising out of an incident which generated much publicity, certain statements made by defendant need not be suppressed on the ground that the act of a police officer in providing defendant with a newspaper containing front-page coverage of the incident was calculated to provoke a statement, thereby purportedly rendering defendant's statements involuntary, since the officer's conduct, made after defendant's repeated insistence to see the paper, cannot be construed as an attempt to elicit or provoke an incriminating statement, and the police are not obligated to prevent a talkative person in custody from making an incriminating statement; defendant's outburst upon viewing the newspaper was in no way connected to police interrogation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Confession -- Spontaneous Declaration to Assistant District Attorney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. In a criminal prosecution, the statements made by the 17-year-old defendant to an Assistant District Attorney (ADA) at a police station should not be suppressed on the ground that they closely followed a period of intense interrogation and were made after his attorney had contacted the station and requested that all questioning of his client cease, since defendant's unprovoked and unsolicited remarks to the ADA, who identified himself as such to defendant, were spontaneous and not subject to suppression; the ADA was not obligated to refuse to listen to defendant's remarks.  Those remarks were not tainted by defendant's prior custodial statements elicited in a police car, since over four hours elapsed between defendant's initial statement and his outburst and defendant was not subjected to continuous police interrogation, thereby attenuating any taint resulting from the earlier remarks, which were suppressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Academic and Moot Questions -- Use of Race-Based Peremptory Challenges by Defense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. In a prosecution arising out of an incident in which a mob of white youths attacked and beat three black men, causing one of the men to run across a highway and be killed by an oncoming car, the issue of whether it is permissible for the defense to exercise its peremptory jury challenges in such a way as to exclude potential black jurors is moot where the only black juror seated was ultimately discharged on consent of both sides after the juror's son became ill, and, thus, defendants were not aggrieved by the trial court's ruling that the defense must provide a racially neutral explanation for rejecting potential black jurors; however, inasmuch as the question of whether the defense may use race-based peremptory challenges is one of integral importance to the criminal justice system, recurs on a continual basis, and often evades appellate review, the court shall address the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Selection of Jury -- Use of Race-Based Peremptory Challenges by Defense -- State Action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The rule of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson v Kentucky</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (476 U.S. 79),which prohibits the prosecution from exercising its peremptory jury challenges in a racially discriminatory manner, may be applied to the defense in a criminal action since the threshold requirement of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, viz., State action, is not absent when a defendant, rather than the State, exercises his peremptory challenges to strike a juror; the source of the authority for a defendant's exercise of racially discriminatory peremptory challenges is State law, since peremptory challenges are not constitutionally mandated, but exist solely by reason of State statute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, CPL 270.25).  Moreover, State action is intimately involved in the jury selection process since it cannot be said that when the defense exercises its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner, the State is merely an observer where the State, by means of the exercise of real and apparent judicial authority in excusing the challenged juror, directly effects defendant's discriminatory act.  To permit the defense to peremptorily strike jurors solely on the basis of race would necessarily and inevitably lead to injury to the jury system, injury to the law as an institution, and injury to the democratic ideals reflected in the processes in the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Selection of Jury -- Use of Race-Based Peremptory Challenges by Defense -- Third-Party Standing of State to Object</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Under the principles of third-party standing, the State has standing to object to a defendant's use of race-based peremptory jury challenges in selecting a jury, notwithstanding the fact that the State, i.e., the prosecution, is not a member of the cognizable racial group sought to be excluded from the petit jury, since the State has a substantial relationship with the excluded jurors and the community at large, and has a direct interest in protecting the rights of its citizens, since the rights of those infringed upon will not be asserted by anyone other than the State given the fact that in almost every instance the excluded juror is unaware that he has been discriminated against when he is dismissed by the court, and since the dismissed juror is not a party to the litigation.  In view of the unlikelihood of anyone other than the State asserting the rights of the excluded jurors and of the community, those rights would likely be severely diluted or adversely affected unless the State were permitted to seek vindication thereof in the context of a particular case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Selection of Jury -- Use of Race-Based Peremptory Challenges by Defense -- State Equal Protection Clause</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. The racially discriminatory exercise of peremptory challenges by a criminal defendant in selecting a jury violates the State Equal Protection Clause (NY Const, art I, &sect; 11); the second sentence of the section is a civil rights provision intended to protect rights which are &quot;elsewhere declared&quot;, thereby guaranteeing to each individual in the State the rights and privileges of citizenship, which necessarily encompass the right to serve on a petit jury </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Civil Rights Law &sect; 13; Judiciary Law &sect; 500).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Selection of</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Jury -- Use of Race-Based Peremptory Challenges by Defense </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">-- Trial Court Procedure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. The court in a criminal trial complied with the procedure set forth in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson v Kentucky</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (476 U.S. 79), which prohibits the prosecution from using race-based peremptory challenges in selecting a jury, after ruling that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> applied to the defense, where the Judge inquired of the defense whether it intended to offer any opposition to the prosecutor's motion which asserted that the defense was systematically excluding blacks from the jury solely on the basis of race and defense counsel stated that they had no intention of responding to that claim; accordingly, the court did not have to give the defense the opportunity to articulate race-neutral reasons for their previously exercised peremptory challenges against black jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Selection of Jury -- Use of Race-Based Peremptory Challenges by Defense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. In a criminal prosecution, the trial court's finding that the defense was systematically excluding black jurors from the jury panel solely on the basis of race by the use of peremptory challenges was supported by the record; the reasons for the exercise of peremptory challenges by the defense against black jurors were made known by the defense early in the voir dire and since many of the black jurors who were peremptorily struck by the defense had previously been unsuccessfully challenged for cause, the court had an appreciation of the underlying rationale for the defense's peremptory challenges.  Moreover, the experienced Trial Judge observed the jury selection procedure, was able to assess counsel's questions and statements during voir dire, and was fully aware that the defense had been successful in excluding all of the black jurors from the venire through a combination of challenges for cause and the use of peremptory challenges.  Accordingly, even in the absence of a declaration of intent by defense counsel, the court's finding was proper and supported by the record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Selection of Jury -- Use of Race-Based Peremptory Challenges by Defense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. In a criminal prosecution arising out of an incident in which a mob of white youths attacked and beat three black men, causing the death of one of them, the fact that the crimes committed by defendants were racially motivated does not permit defense counsel to exercise their peremptory challenges against any black juror solely on the basis of race, since the ruling in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson v Kentucky</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (476 U.S. 79), which prohibited the use of race-based peremptory challenges by the prosecution, clearly reflects an intention to prohibit all racially based peremptory challenges, including those which are related to the issues of a particular case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Evidence -- Hearsay -- Present Sense Impression -- Harmless Error</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17. In a criminal prosecution, although defendants' contention that it was error to have permitted the prosecution to introduce into evidence a redacted tape recording of a telephone call to an emergency police operator under the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule may have merit, the error, if any, was harmless in view of the overwhelming proof of defendants' guilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Consolidation and Severance -- Multiplicity of Defendants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">18. In a criminal prosecution arising out of an incident in which a mob of white youths attacked and beat three black men, causing the death of one of them, the motions of three defendants for severance were properly denied; each of defendants' inculpatory statements was redacted to avoid any references to the others and, thus, the statements as received into evidence were neither facially nor inferentially incriminating.  Given the involvement of approximately a dozen youths in the attack, the redaction of the specific references to the defendants and the inserted references to the &quot;others&quot; or &quot;another&quot; clearly did not prejudice defendants.  Moreover, the court gave a proper limiting instruction to the jury concerning the use of each of the defendants' statements against the remaining codefendants; thus, defendants' right of confrontation was not violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Lesser Included Offense -- Assault</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">19. In a criminal prosecution arising out of an incident in which a mob of youths attacked and beat a man, the trial court did not err in refusing to charge assault in the third degree (Penal Law &sect; 120.00 [1]) as a lesser included offense of assault in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 120.10 [1]) since no reasonable view of the evidence would support the conclusion that the victim's injuries were not inflicted by the use of dangerous instruments, to wit, bats and tree limbs </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, CPL 300.50 [1]); moreover, defendant's challenge to the denial of the jury charge is foreclosed by reason of the jury's verdict of guilt as to the assault in the first degree counts and its implicit rejection of the charged lesser included offense of assault in the second degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Harsh and Excessive Sentence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">20. In a criminal proceeding arising out of an incident in which a mob of white youths attacked and beat three black men, causing the death of one of them, the sentences of imprisonment meted out to three defendants, viz., two consecutive terms of 5 to 15 years for one defendant, two consecutive sentences of 3 to 9 years for another defendant, and two consecutive sentences of 2 1/2 to 7 1/2 years to the third defendant, were neither harsh nor excessive in light of their vicious and racially motivated conduct; moreover, defendants showed absolutely no remorse for their crimes.  Each defendant displayed inexplicable callousness towards the victims and must be held accountable.  </SPAN></P>

The park owners argued that the inclusion in the assessment of the value of the mobile homes, owned by others, violated N.Y. Const., art.

The statutory authority for classifying mobile homes such as those on the owners' property as real property to be included within the assessment &quot;against the real property itself&quot; was under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town justice sought punitive damages and attorney fees, claiming that a reduction in salary during his term of office amounted to an unconstitutional encroachment upon the independence of the judiciary. The town justice alleged that the town board purposefully reduced his salary because it was unhappy with some of his decisions and wanted to punish him for those decisions and, at the same time, influence future rulings. The town board contended that N.Y. Town Law &sect; 27 (1932) authorized it to reduce a town justice's salary during the term of office. The court rejected the town board's contention and held that the legislature did not intend the power to fix salaries to include the power to reduce a town justice's salary during the term of office. The court concluded that the reduction of the town justice's salary during his term of office violated fundamental principles of separation of powers and constituted an impermissible encroachment upon the independence of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reduction of the salary of a Town Justice during the Justice's elective term constitutes an impermissible encroachment upon the independence of the judiciary and violates fundamental principles of separation of powers; accordingly, petitioner Town Justice is entitled to have his prior salary reinstated.

Moreover, Town Law &sect; 27, which permits a town board to &quot;fix, from time to time, the salaries of all officers and employees of said town&quot;, does not authorize the reduction of a sitting Town Justice's salary since that statute was enacted when the State Constitution expressly prohibited any diminution in the compensation of a Justice of the Peace, and it should not be inferred that the Legislature intended that the power to fix salaries includes the power to reduce a Justice's salary during his term of office. </SPAN></P>

The court rejected petitioners' due process argument because the laws controlling funeral directors and establishments were not unconstitutionally vague, and the written charges were sufficient for petitioners to prepare a defense. A charge for failure to retain a receipt for a vault was not proper because the proof showed that a vault was never provided to the customer, which supported the conviction on another charge. Other charges were not proper because the Department failed to prove that petitioners knew that their corporate status had been revoked. Proof of knowledge was essential to a finding of fraudulent intent. Nine other charges had to be dismissed because the ALJ made statements concerning the lack of proof, and it was arbitrary and capricious for the ALJ to later sustain those charges.

Second, the statements that defendant made while in the patrol car, at a time when he was in custody without the benefit of Miranda warnings, were admissible because they were spontaneous.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, Governor of the State of New York and State Ethics Commission, sought review of the order of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which granted plaintiff attorneys' motion for a preliminary injunction restraining defendants from enforcing the Ethics in Government Act and restraining enforcement of N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 73(8) against state officers and employees who left state service prior to January 1, 1989.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the attorneys entered private practice following employment as state officers or employees, the attorneys brought an action against defendants, seeking a declaration that N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 73(8) was unconstitutional or, in the alternative, seeking an injunction prohibiting defendants from enforcing an advisory opinion to the Ethics in Government Act (Act). The trial court granted the preliminary injunction, and defendants sought review. On appeal, the court held that the attorneys' contentions that N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 73(8) was violative of equal protection was not likely to succeed on the merits based on a prior ruling that held that &sect; 73(8) did not violate equal protection. The court held that &sect; 73(8) was prospective in nature and therefore did not constitute the type of enactment prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The attorneys' claim of improper delegation of authority was not likely to succeed. The attorneys' were likely to prevail on the issue that the Act violated the doctrine of separation of powers, but the attorneys did not establish that they would suffer irreparable harm without the preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order granting a preliminary injunction to the attorneys because the trial court abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A preliminary injunction is a drastic remedy which should be issued sparingly and only when the moving party establishes the likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable injury absent granting the injunction, and a balancing of the equities in its favor, and in considering whether a preliminary injunction was properly issued, appellate review is limited to whether the Supreme Court abused its discretion.  Accordingly, in an action to declare invalid and unconstitutional a provision of the Ethics in Government Act (L 1987, ch 813) which places restrictions on how a former State officer or employee may earn compensation after he has separated from State service </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Public Officers Law &sect; 73 [8]), Supreme Court abused its discretion in granting the motion of plaintiff attorneys, who left State employment prior to January 1, 1989, for a preliminary injunction restraining the State Ethics Commission from enforcing an advisory opinion holding that plaintiffs are prohibited from appearing before their former agencies for two years, since the merits of plaintiffs' main contentions were discussed and resolved against them in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Forti v New York State Ethics Commn</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (147 AD2d 269), wherein it was determined that the Act did apply to people in plaintiffs' position, and that equal protection is not offended by treating State officers and employees differently from legislators and legislative employees inasmuch as there is a rational basis for the disparate treatment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Public Officers Law &sect; 73 (8), which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, prohibits former State officers and employees from appearing before their former agencies for two years, does not violate the Federal constitutional proscription against ex post facto laws, and, consequently, no preliminary injunction should issue restraining enforcement of a State Ethics Commission advisory opinion holding that the statute applies to attorneys who separate from State service prior to January 1, 1989, since plaintiff attorneys are not likely to succeed on the merits of their claim; the statute is prospective in nature, regulating conduct after January 1, 1989, and does not seem to constitute the type of enactment prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Moreover, the limited restrictions on plaintiffs' practicing of their profession are not the types of punishment proscribed by the Ex Post Facto Clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Officers -- Conflicts of Interest -- Employment Prohibitions on Former State Officers and Employees -- Improper Delegation of Authority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A preliminary injunction restraining the State Ethics Commission from enforcing an advisory opinion holding that State officers and employees who leave State service prior to January 1, 1989 are prohibited for two years from appearing before their former agencies should not issue; Public Officers Law &sect; 73 (8), which codifies the two-year prohibition, does not include an improper delegation of the legislative function by allowing State agencies to adopt more restrictive &quot;revolving door&quot; standards regulating practice before them, and there is little chance of plaintiff attorneys, who separated from State service prior to January 1, 1989, being successful on the merits of their improper delegation claim.  It seems probable that a court would conclude that the Legislature could delegate authority to State agencies to adopt more restrictive &quot;revolving door&quot; provisions in light of the Legislature's clear purposes and intentions in enacting the Ethics in Government Act (L 1987, ch 813), viz., to restore public confidence in government and promote ethical behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Officers -- Conflicts of Interest -- Employment Prohibitions on Former State Officers and Employees -- Separation of Powers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Under Public Officers Law &sect; 73 (14), the State Ethics Commission has authority either to impose civil penalties for knowing and intentional violations of the &quot;revolving door&quot; provisions of the Ethics in Government Act (L 1987, ch 813), which restrict the employment opportunities of former State officers and employees, or to refer a violation to the appropriate prosecutor for criminal sanctions; however, it is the executive who is constitutionally charged to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed and who, represented by the prosecutor, has primary discretion in deciding whether to bring criminal charges.  Accordingly, by giving the Commission prosecutorial discretion, the Legislature has essentially and improperly infringed upon an executive branch function, and since plaintiff attorneys, who left State employment prior to January 1, 1989 and are prohibited from appearing before their former agencies for two years, would be subject to criminal exposure if they undertook any proscribed acts in their private practices, their contention is justiciable, especially in a declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Injunctions -- Preliminary Injunction -- Ethics in Government Act -- Irreparable Harm -- Balancing of Equities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Although plaintiff attorneys, who left State service prior to January 1, 1989 and are prohibited from appearing before their former agencies for two years, are likely to prevail on their claim that Public Officers Law &sect; 73 (14), which gives the State Ethics Commission the authority to refer violations of the Ethics in Government Act (L 1987, ch 813) to prosecutors, is a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers, they are still not entitled to a preliminary injunction restraining enforcement of an advisory opinion of the State Ethics Commission holding that the two-year employment restrictions are applicable to plaintiffs, since plaintiffs have failed to show irreparable injury or that the equities are in their favor; the provisions of the Act which apparently violate the separation of powers doctrine can be severed from the rest of the Act, thereby leaving no reason to enjoin the applicability of the rest of the Act, and the equities do not favor issuing the preliminary injunction since it is likely that only the penalty provisions of Public Officers Law &sect; 73 (14) will be affected by any ultimate success on the merits by plaintiffs, whereas the substantive provisions governing plaintiffs' conduct will likely remain intact.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was working for a state agency at the time that the Ethics in Government Act passed. The attorney left government employment before the Act became effective, but after its enactment.

The lower court held that the classification contained in &sect; 73(8) violated the equal protection guarantee under the New York and United States Constitutions.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Public Officers Law &sect; 73 (8), which set revised ethics standards prohibiting former State officers and employees from, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, appearing before their former agencies for two years, does apply to State officers and employees who left State service prior to January 1, 1989 where the statute specifically states that it applies only to legislative employees who left or leave State service on or after January 1, 1989, since the Legislature clearly considered which categories of public servants who left State service before January 1, 1989 are subject to the law, and by specifically not according State officers and employees the same treatment as legislative employees, the Legislature evidently intended the former category of public servants to be treated differently from the latter category.  The statute expressly applies to any &quot;person who has served as a state officer or employee&quot;; however, the words &quot;has served&quot; are not dispositive, since they can reasonably apply to any individual who was but is no longer a State officer or employee regardless of whether his State service ended before, on, or after January 1, 1989.  Moreover, inasmuch as section 73 (8) repealed by implication Public Officers Law &sect; 73 former (7), if the new statute did not apply to State officers and employees who left State service prior to January 1, 1989, then no such ethics provision would govern their conduct, a result which could not have been intended.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Public Officers Law &sect; 73 (8), which set revised ethics standards for State officers and employees who separate from State employment, repealed by implication Public Officers Law &sect; 73 former (7).  Although repeals by implication are not favored, an amendment which covers the entire subject is deemed to repeal the previous omitted parts by implication; as a sweeping reform imposing a comprehensive ethics code, the Ethics in Government Act (L 1987, ch 813), of which section 73 (8) is a part, was clearly intended to cover the field so that previous omitted provisions, such as section 73 former (7), were repealed. Moreover, the express intention for revival of the former subdivision in the event that the Act's amendments are declared invalid indicates that the former subdivision was repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Officers -- Conflicts of Interest -- Retroactivity of Revised Statutory Ethics Standards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Public Officers Law &sect; 73 (8), which set revised ethics standards for State officers and employees who separate from State service, is not retroactive or contrary to the fundamental principle that statutes should be applied prospectively, absent a clear indication otherwise; although the statute is intended to apply to State officers and employees who left State service before January 1, 1989, it only affects conduct occurring on or after that date, so it is not truly retroactive. The argument of plaintiff, an attorney who left State service prior to January 1, 1989 and who is prohibited from appearing before his former agency for two years notwithstanding the fact that the expertise he gained in his former position allegedly led to his hiring by his present law firm, that application of the statute's restrictions on postseparation employment creates a harsh result is rejected since the law does not prevent plaintiff from practicing his chosen profession or even his specialty; plaintiff may perform a variety of activities, including appearing in court against his former agency, so long as he does not appear or practice before the agency during the time periods specified in the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Officers -- Conflicts of Interest -- Employment Prohibitions on Former State Officers and Employees -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Public Officers Law &sect; 73 (8), which set revised ethics standards for State officers and employees who separate from State service and which placed greater restrictions on former State officers and employees than on legislators or legislative employees, does not violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection since the Legislature could rationally determine that public servants' postemployment restrictions should be a function of the institutional checks endemic to a particular governmental process which encourage ethical conduct; arguments as to the wisdom and effectiveness of the statute are irrelevant to an equal protection analysis.  The Legislature must answer to the voters every two years, and such public accountability, absent at even the highest levels of the administrative processes, can reasonably be considered as the ultimate institutional check on the conduct of legislators and legislative employees; the administrative process, by contrast, is characterized by relatively few decision makers, generally working in a single agency, so that the potential for improper conduct is more concentrated.  Inasmuch as there is a rational basis to classify State officers and employees differently from legislative employees, the exclusion of only legislative employees who left State service before January 1, 1989 from coverage under the statute does not constitute an unconstitutional classification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Officers -- Conflicts of Interest -- Employment Prohibitions on Former State Officers and Employees -- Due Process</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Public Officers Law &sect; 73 (8), which set revised ethics standards for State officers and employees who separate from State employment, resulting in plaintiff attorney being prohibited from appearing before his former agency for two years, does not violate the doctrine of separation of powers by intruding upon the judiciary's authority over the conduct of attorneys since the Legislature has traditionally regulated various aspects of attorneys' conduct; the Legislature also has the power to delegate authority to administrative agencies so long as there are adequate standards for administration, and in light of the comprehensiveness of the Ethics in Government Act (L 1987, ch 813), of which section 73 (8) is a part, there is no constitutional problem.  Accordingly, in the absence of any successful constitutional challenge, summary judgment in favor of defendant State Ethics Commission is warranted even though it did not move for summary judgment below.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At approximately 10:00 p.m., two police officers were on duty seated in a marked patrol car on the lookout for traffic violators. They observed defendant, who was standing near a subway entrance. The officers watched defendant look up and down the street, look up and down the subway stairs, and, thereafter, return to a position near the wall. Two or three times during this period he placed his right hand inside his jacket as though he were adjusting something. The officers approached defendant, and they noticed a bulge in his jacket pocket. While the officers testified that the bulge was not identifiable as a gun, they frisked defendant and recovered the gun in issue. Defendant was subsequently convicted of attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. The court reversed the conviction, holding that the search was improper because the officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that defendant was about to commit a crime. His movements near the subway station were innocuous, and the observation of a bulge in his pocket was an insufficient basis for a search of a weapon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Stop and Frisk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A motion to suppress a gun found on the person of defendant should be granted and an indictment charging him with criminal possession of a weapon dismissed where the circumstances observed by the arresting police officers who searched defendant did not rise to the level of reasonable suspicion; defendant's behavior during the short time he was being observed by the officers was innocuous or, at best, equivocal where defendant was standing near a subway entrance at 10:00 p.m., looking down the subway stairs and up and down the streets, and then moving to stand near a wall.  Defendant did not make any furtive or threatening gestures which might indicate that criminal activity was afoot, and his conduct was consistent with that of an innocent man.  The only other fact observed by the officers was defendant twice reaching inside his jacket pocket as though he were adjusting something, and that innocuous movement was readily susceptible of an innocent interpretation.  The fact that defendant walked away when he saw the officers approach did not provide a basis for any greater level of intrusion than the minimal level of approaching to request information, and by submitting to the officers' command to halt, defendant was seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  Mere observation of an undefinable bulge in defendant's pocket is insufficient as a basis for a frisk, and the unsupported conclusory statements by the officers that they were in fear of their lives appears to be little more than a rote recital of the words deemed necessary to retroactively validate a patently improper search.  Moreover, the fact that defendant was seized in a &quot;high crime area&quot; cannot alone justify excessive police behavior.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant town and respondent state cross-appealed from the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (New York), which declared that N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 27-0704 (2) violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, that N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 27-0704 (4) (a) was not violative of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, and that N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 27-0704 was not violative of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 27-0704 incorporated a preexisting &quot;law,&quot; and thus violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 16. The court reversed because the major purpose of the constitutional requirement that a statute contain an explicit recitation of its terms, rather than an indirect expression of them through the incorporation of another law, was to assist all persons concerned -- such as the lawmakers themselves or those to be affected by the law -- to easily and readily comprehend what the law actually means. However, the court held that the statute in question not only referred to another document (not a &quot;law&quot;), but also expressly stated where that document could be found, so it violated neither the letter nor the spirit of the constitution. The court also concluded that any question involving the constitutionality of the legislature's delegation of certain authority on the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation presented no justiciable controversy because there was no indication that the Commissioner considered exercising the power which the trial court enjoined him from exercising.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the trial court erred insofar as it declared that one environmental protection statute unconstitutionally incorporated another law. The court further found that the trial court's declaration that other portions of the environmental statutes were constitutional should be deleted because there was no justiciable controversy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. ECL 27-0704, which places limitations on the ability of local governments in Nassau and Suffolk Counties to build new landfills or expand existing landfills within any geographic area designated as &quot;a deep flow recharge area&quot;, as defined in the Long Island Comprehensive Waste Treatment Management Plan of 1978, does not violate NY Constitution, article III, &sect; 16, which prohibits one statute from incorporating by reference another statute, since the aforementioned Plan cannot be characterized properly as a &quot;law&quot;; rather, it is a scientific study which contains certain geological data.  Accordingly, the terms of the Constitution, construed literally, do not apply, and even if the constitutional provision is liberally interpreted, there would be no violation since there is no realistic possibility that any party likely to be affected by the statute has been left ignorant of its scope, and since there is little chance that a revision of the Plan would have consequences unforeseen, much less overlooked, by the Legislature.  Moreover, there is no evidence that the hydrogeologic zones, which may be changed by administrative action, have ever undergone revision; thus, whether the automatic incorporation of a revised Plan would violate the Constitution is an academic question.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action in which plaintiff town sought a declaration that ECL 27-0704 (2) is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the extent that it permits the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation to alter the boundaries of &quot;a deep flow recharge area&quot;, within which landfills may not be built or expanded, no justiciable controversy is presented since the Commissioner has never changed the boundaries of such area and there is no allegation of his having any intent to do so in the future; consequently, any question involving the constitutionality of the Legislature's delegation to the Commissioner of the power to make changes is essentially academic.  Any declaration would be purely advisory and there is no indication that plaintiff plans to construct or operate a landfill in any area outside the boundaries of a deep flow recharge area as it is now defined.  The harm which plaintiff anticipates, i.e., an enlargement of the area in question, may never occur; thus, there is no controversy ripe for judicial review.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing -- Environmental Conservation -- Landfills and Groundwater</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.

The Commissioner is entrusted with the discretion to determine whether construction or expansion of a landfill would pose a threat to groundwater quality </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, ECL 27-0704 [4] [a]), and plaintiff has not shown itself to have been adversely affected since it has neither alleged nor proved that the Commissioner has exercised, or has threatened to exercise, the power to preclude the construction of landfills outside the boundaries of the current recharge area.  Accordingly, there is no justiciable controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Justiciable Questions -- Lack of One Party to Address Question</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a declaratory judgment action in which it has been determined that there is no justiciable controversy, notwithstanding the fact that the lack of a justiciable controversy was argued solely by one party, the court should examine the issue, since lack of a justiciable controversy is a fundamental defect.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporation brought a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 to review a determination of respondent, the state tax commission (commission), which sustained a corporate franchise tax assessment imposed under N.Y. Tax Law art. 9-A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission concluded that because N.Y. Code R. &amp; Regs. tit. 20, &sect; 4-4.3(f)(2) applied only to receipts from radio and television advertising, it did not affect the prior practice of treating receipts from magazine advertisements under the origin formula. The commission sustained the audit division's notices of deficiency and presumed the constitutionality of its interpretation because it was uncontroverted that the advertising contracts originated in New York. The court granted the corporation's petition, finding that the regulation was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. I. The court concluded that the regulation permitted the broadcasting of commercial messages by way of radio or television to be classified as a service, but such a classification during the audit period was not permitted for the corporation, whose advertising receipts arose from sales of advertising contained in its publications. The court determined that the difference in treatment between the print and broadcast media under the regulation violated amend. I guarantee of freedom of the press, and the commission did not show that the regulation was necessary to serve a compelling state interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the corporation's petition, and annulled the commission's determination, finding that the regulation at issue was unconstitutional under the First Amendment.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- Transfer to Appellate Division -- Retention of Proceeding Improperly Transferred</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Inasmuch as a proceeding to review a determination of the State Tax Commission sustaining a corporate franchise tax assessment concerned only questions of law, it did not involve an issue of substantial evidence under CPLR 7803 (4) and was, therefore, improperly transferred to the Appellate Division; however, in the interest of judicial economy, the court shall address the merits of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Franchise Tax on Business Corporations -- Tax on Print Media Advertising Revenue -- Constitutionality of Differentiation between Print and Broadcast Media</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding to review a determination of the State Tax Commission sustaining a corporate franchise tax assessment against a nationwide magazine publisher on the grounds that the entire amount of net receipts it derived from advertising should be used in calculating the tax (i.e., the origin formula), rather than only that percentage of the total net advertising income that its New York circulation bore to the total circulation (i.e., the destination formula), a regulation (20 NYCRR 4-4.3 [f] [2]), which provided that the destination formula should be applied only to receipts from broadcast media, violates the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press by permitting a difference in treatment between the print and broadcast media; a tax that singles out the press for differential treatment is presumptively unconstitutional, and a taxing scheme which taxes some members of the press but exempts others of the press does not escape First Amendment scrutiny even if businesses outside of the press are also not exempt. Given the disparate treatment between the print and broadcast media, it was incumbent upon the Commission to show that the regulation was necessary to serve a compelling State interest, and the Commission failed to do so; although the unique nature of electronic media makes it more susceptible to government regulation and there are many differences between the two media, those factors do not justify the different treatment.  </SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and reinstated the order of the lower court. The court held that the vacate order did not terminate the tenancies because the vacate order were issued to protect public safety and required that the landlords correct the conditions that rendered the buildings unfit for habitability under New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 27-2140(c)(1). The court rejected the landlords' contention of economic hardship because the need to make the repairs should have been anticipated.

The Supreme Court held that the state's compelling interest in regulating child pornography was not dependent on whether the material was distributed commercially or possessed privately because the focus was on the harm to the child.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Departmental Disciplinary Committee, sought an order striking respondent attorney's name from the roll of attorneys pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was convicted of aiding and conspiring to aide a racketeering enterprise, extortion, receiving a bribe, mail fraud, and perjury. The Committee argued that the attorney's conviction for giving a false declaration before a grand jury under 18 U.S.C.S. 1623 was essentially similar to a perjury violation under N.Y.

Counsel for the attorney stated that the attorney was appealing his convictions, and that the application of &sect; 90(4)(a) to provide for the automatic disbarment, prior to the resolution of his appeal, constituted deprivation of the attorney's property without due process of law. The court held that that argument had already been rejected. Under the statutory scheme, disbarment at the time of the attorney's conviction was required. If the conviction was subsequently reversed or the attorney was pardoned, he could then seek vacatur or modification of the disbarment under N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 90(5).</SPAN></P>

The unequivocal language of the statute demonstrates the Legislature's intent to disbar convicted felons without waiting for the criminal appeal process to be exhausted; Judiciary Law &sect; 90 (5), which provides for the vacatur or modification of the disbarment if the conviction is subsequently reversed or pardoned, evidences the Legislature's rejection of an alternative to automatic disbarment and establishes that an automatically disbarred attorney is not without recourse in the event of a successful appeal. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town appealed from the Supreme Court in Suffolk County (New York), which granted a motion by plaintiff for summary judgment in an action for a judgment declaring that certain provisions of the town code were unconstitutional insofar as they were applicable to the mining industry, adjudged those provisions unconstitutional, and transferred lead agency status from defendant town to the State Department of Environmental Conservation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the owner of mineral rights of a residentially zoned parcel of real property located in defendant town, sought to declare that the provisions of the town code, Smithtown, N.Y., Code &sect;&sect; 54 and 44A, were unconstitutional insofar as they were applicable to the mining industry. The town had enacted amendments to the ordinance to allow sand mining only within districts specifically zoned for heavy industry. The amendment provided that any enterprise seeking to conduct a sand mining operation within a &quot;heavy industry&quot; district had to comply with certain requirements and had to establish that the proposed mining operation would not produce a significant adverse effect upon the environment. The court reversed the granting of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff. The court disagreed with the lower court that the New York State Mined Land Reclamation Law, ECL &sect; 23-2701 et seq., preempted the challenged ordinances and found that the ordinances were constitutional on their face. Further, the court found the ordinance in question was enacted as a proper exercise of the town's legislative function for legitimate objectives in furtherance of the town's health and general welfare.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Two local ordinances, one which regulates the destruction and removal of trees and the other which allows sand mining only in certain districts and pursuant to various restrictions, are constitutional on their face and were not superseded by the State Mined Land Reclamation Law </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, ECL 23-2703 [2]), which provides that local laws are superseded with respect to mining but that localities may impose stricter land reclamation standards, since the mining ordinance deals with the location of the mining and not its operation, and the tree removal ordinance does not constitute an impermissible limitation upon the right to conduct sand mining operations; the tree removal ordinance was a reasonable response to concerns involving the welfare of the community and any impact upon mining operations appears to be incidental rather than as a result of a covert design to circumvent the comprehensive plan for mining set forth in the State statute.  The tree removal ordinance is facially constitutional since it applies equally to all landowners in the community; a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 is the appropriate forum to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance as applied to a particular mining operation.</SPAN></P>

Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 10, &sect; 86-2. The county association brought an action on behalf of those counties that owned and operated nursing homes, challenging the regulations. The department brought a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the claims were barred by the four-month limitations period applicable to proceedings under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78. The trial court denied the motion, and the department appealed. The court modified by reversing as to certain causes of action and otherwise affirmed. The court held that the Article 78 limitation period applied to bar the causes of action alleging that the department acted arbitrarily and capriciously and that the regulations violated federal and state law, because there had been another form of judicial proceeding, namely under Article 78, available to the county association for resolution of their claims. The causes of action challenging the methodology on constitutional grounds were not time-barred because constitutional challenges could not be brought through Article 78 proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Lemon Law (General Business Law &sect; 198-a) does not anticipate an initial revocation of the product on the part of the buyer; the statute speaks to a manufacturer's acceptance of a vehicle from the consumer, but does not explicitly require an outright rejection of the contract by the consumer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, General Business Law &sect; 198-a [c] [1]).  Thus, the Lemon Law provides an equitable alternative akin to the remedy of restitution, which serves to restore the status quo ante without mandating a literal rescission of the contract, and the fact that incidental costs are recoverable does not compel a contrary conclusion, since a party may receive full relief in an equity action.  Moreover, while incidental items are recoverable, consequential damages are not, and the purpose of the Lemon Law was clearly designed as an alternative to the traditional methods of consumer recovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Suffolk County Court (New York), which, upon a jury verdict, convicted him of sexual abuse in the first degree, assault in the second degree, and assault in the third degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In addition to two other crimes, which defendant was not appealing, a jury convicted defendant of sexual abuse in the first degree, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.65(1), which provided that a person was guilty of sexual abuse in the first degree when he subjected another person to sexual contact by &quot;forcible compulsion.&quot; On appeal, defendant argued that although the indictment charged defendant with the use of actual force, the jury was allowed to convict him by finding a threat of force. The court affirmed his conviction. While it would be error for the trial judge to instruct the jury, over objection, that the crime could be committed through a threat when the indictment charges use of actual force, counsel for defendant failed to object to the jury charge. The error of the trial judge in giving the correct definition of the crime but not narrowing the definition to what was contained in the indictment was not such a fundamental irregularity that it should be reviewed, despite defendant's failure to preserve the point for appeal through an objection. Defendant's consecutive sentences were affirmed because the charged offenses involved distinct acts without common material elements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Appellate Review -- Right to be Tried Only on Theories Charged in Indictment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An error in a jury charge, which defendant claims constituted a violation of his constitutional right to be tried only upon theories charged in the indictment, is not reviewable as a matter of law in the absence of a timely objection. Accordingly, where the indictment specified that defendant committed sodomy through the use of actual force alone, it was error for the Trial Judge to have instructed the jury that the crime may also be committed by the use of the threat of force; however, that error was not jurisdictional or otherwise fundamental, and far from working a radical change, constituted, at worse, an instruction which conveyed to the jury the correct definition of the elements of the crime with which defendant was charged, where the indictment against defendant purportedly led him to believe that the People would limit their &quot;theory&quot; so as to, in effect, narrow the definition of the crime.  The preservation doctrine, which requires that errors be objected to at trial when there still is time to cure any defects, applies to many errors affecting fundamental rights, encourages parties to be vigilant, serves as a means of avoiding errors in the first instance, and should only be circumvented where a question of jurisdiction or fundamental rights is involved and public injury would result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Harmless and Prejudicial Error -- Right to be Tried Only on Theories Charged in Indictment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a sex crimes prosecution in which the Trial Judge instructed the jury that the crime of sodomy may be committed by the use of the threat of force, whereas the indictment charged and the prosecutor attempted to prove that defendant used actual force to commit the crime, the error was harmless since defendant was not in any way prejudiced by the alleged error and there was no possibility that that error affected the jury's verdict; under no rational view of the evidence could the jury have convicted defendant based on a finding that he threatened but did not actually exert physical force, the evidence showing that defendant accomplished his crime by actual force as well as by the threats naturally implicit therein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Appellate Review -- Guilt of Offense Not Charged in Indictment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It is not always a nonwaivable jurisdictional error for a Trial Judge to instruct the jury in a criminal case that it may find defendant guilty of an offense not charged in the indictment; jurisdictional error does not occur even when a Trial Judge submits to the jury a crime which is neither itself contained in the indictment, nor one which is necessarily included within any charge contained in the indictment as a lesser included offense.  A defendant may, by failing to make a timely objection, forfeit his right to appellate review of a claim that the Trial Judge erroneously allowed criminal liability to be imposed for a crime which not only was not charged in the indictment, but which also might never have been considered by the Grand Jury, since such error is not so fundamental as to be properly reviewable in the absence of an objection.  Accordingly, assuming that sexual abuse in the first degree perpetrated by threats of force is a different crime from sexual abuse in the first degree perpetrated by the use of actual force, it was not jurisdictional error, thereby reviewable on appeal in the absence of a timely objection, to have instructed the jury that it may find defendant guilty if he used threats where the indictment mentioned only the actual use of force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Appellate Review -- Right to be Tried Only on Theories Charged in Indictment -- Fair Notice to Defendant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a sex crimes prosecution in which the indictment stated that defendant committed the crime of sodomy by the use of actual force and the Trial Judge instructed the jury that it could find defendant guilty if he merely threatened the use of force, the alleged variance between the terms of the indictment and the charge was so slight as to render inconceivable the idea that defendant might have been deprived of fair notice of the theory that the prosecution would pursue as that theory was ultimately reflected in the jury charge. Had defendant registered a timely protest, the error would likely have been cured; however, inasmuch as there was no possibility that defendant was deprived of fair notice of the basis for the accusations against him, no question of law is presented for appellate review in the absence of a timely objection at trial.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty by way of an Alford plea to avoid conviction on more serious charges after the trial court denied his motion for a mistrial based on the prosecution's allegedly discriminatory use of peremptory challenges to exclude all black venire persons from the jury. The trial court also denied a subsequent motion by defendant to withdraw his plea. The court affirmed the order of the trial court. The court held that (1) defendant's Batson claim was subsumed within the waiver of his right to a trial that resulted from his guilty plea and did not survive the guilty plea; (2) a Batson motion would not be treated like the denial of a suppression motion because the right to appeal a suppression ruling after a guilty plea was provided by N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 710.70(2) and the statutory exception should not be judicially expanded; and (3) precedent cited by defendant was distinguishable because in that case the defendant had waived a jury trial, not pleaded guilty.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights are no greater than his right to a jury trial itself which is waived by a guilty plea.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, corporations and real estate company, challenged a judgment of the Supreme Court in Albany County (New York) which dismissed their petition to review the determination of appellee state tax commission, which assessed a real property transfer gains tax pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law art. 31-B.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A real estate company that was jointly owned by three corporations entered into a partnership agreement whereby it assigned its rights in a piece of real estate to the limited partnership. The real estate company and its individual partner orally agreed that the individual's designee would acquire the realty company's stock for a sum that was commensurate with 85 percent of the appraised property value of the real estate. The state tax commission assessed a 10 percent gains tax on the transfer pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law art. 31-B after it was characterized as a transfer of real property in excess of $ 1,000,000. The lower court upheld that assessment. The court held that the tax commission rationally determined that the transaction was a transfer of real property because: (1) N. Y. Tax law &sect; 1440(7) employed an expansive, rather than a literal, definition of real property to maximize revenue, and (2) the statute included transfers of any interest in real property. The court deferred to the state tax commission's rational decision to look beyond the two-tiered nature of the conveyance in order to determine that the parties effectively transferred an interest in the real estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment without costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Real Property Transfer Gains Tax -- Two-Tiered Conveyance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State Tax Commission rationally determined that a transaction was subject to the real property transfer gains tax imposed by Tax Law article 31-B, where one corporation acquired stock from another corporation which had an 85% interest in a partnership which, in turn, held title to certain real property, since the definition of &quot;transfer of real property&quot; (Tax Law &sect; 1440 [7]) includes transfers of &quot;any interest in real property by any method, including but not limited to&quot; certain described formats, and that broad, expansive definition was designed to maximize revenues.  The statutory definition evinces a legislative deferral to the Commission's construction of the transfer concept; the Commission looked beyond the two-tiered nature of the conveyance and determined that petitioner corporations effectively transferred an interest in the property and that determination keys into the economic reality that the partnership's sole asset consisted of the subject property and that the new 85% general partner acquired a controlling interest in the real estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Real Property Transfer Gains Tax -- Federal Preemption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The State Tax Commission rationally determined that a transaction was subject to the real property transfer gains tax imposed by Tax Law article 31-B, and the argument of petitioners, three public Netherlands corporations, that Internal Revenue Code &sect; 897 (26 USC &sect; 897), enacted as part of the Foreign Investors in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, precludes application of article 31-B to the instant conveyance is unavailing since the Federal act, which prevented the imposition of a tax on gains from foreign investments until 1985, did not preempt New York's taxing authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Real Property Transfer Gains Tax -- Exemption -- Transfer Made Prior to Effective Date</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The State Tax Commission rationally determined that a transaction was subject to the real property transfer gains tax imposed by Tax Law article 31-B and that petitioner corporations are not entitled to the exemption contained in Tax Law &sect; 1443 (6) where petitioners failed to enter into a &quot;written contract&quot; to consummate the transaction prior to the effective date of article 31-B; the Commission is accorded considerable discretion in assessing whether the &quot;written contract&quot; exemption has been satisfied, and there was evidence that the written board resolutions authorizing the transaction were not unqualified prior to the effective date of the statute, but were conditioned on the approval of remaining terms of sale. That contingency speaks against a binding option agreement, and the record does not show that payment and certain written notice provisions of a buy-sell agreement were implemented, a fact which indicates that the ultimate conveyance was not simply a direct exercise of a pretax option agreement, but the result of negotiations independent of any option rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Real Estate Transfer Gains Tax -- Retroactive Taxation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Assessment of the real estate transfer gains tax (Tax Law art 31-B) against petitioner corporations did not constitute retroactive taxation in violation of due process where petitioners were contractually obligated to sell certain stock containing an interest in real property three days prior to the effective date of the transfer tax, since the retroactive extension of a taxing statute does not, per se, violate the Due Process Clause of the 5th Amendment; significantly, petitioners were cognizant of the pending gains tax legislation one week before it became effective, were advised to execute a written agreement to insure an exemption, and then orally committed themselves to the transaction several days later, and given that scenario, it is difficult to perceive any justifiable reliance on a pregains tax status.  Moreover, petitioners executed their written stock sale agreement one day after the gains tax went into effect; there was no excessive retroactive period and the legislation constituted a legitimate revenue generating measure.  </SPAN></P>

The business sought to expand from a service station to include a convenience store, but it would have to remove its nonconforming sign.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business use of the property, which was a service station, predated the zoning ordinance, so the business could continue its operation, including the sign, as a prior nonconforming use. The business wanted to add a convenience store, so it sought a zoning ordinance amendment to create a planned development district. The trial court dismissed the business's application to remove the condition created by the ordinance. The court affirmed. The court held that the condition for approving the development district, removing the nonconforming sign, not only promoted the aesthetic purpose underlying the sign provisions but advanced a more fundamental zoning goal. The court observed that a strong policy favored the eventual elimination of nonconforming uses, and the amendment promoted that policy by rezoning the business so that the commercial use was no longer nonconforming. The business argued that the condition requiring removal was an unconstitutional taking of its property, but the court noted that the condition substantially advanced legitimate state interests, and the business failed to establish that the condition denied it an economically viable property use.</SPAN></P>

The board refused to grant a variance, and the supreme court upheld that determination. On the property owner's appeal, the court affirmed the supreme court's decision, holding that because compliance with the zoning ordinance's parking standards was necessary before a conditional use permit could be issued, and because the board had no power to waive or modify the conditions specified in the ordinance, the property owner was not entitled to a conditional use permit, and also failed to demonstrate the need for a variance.

C.P.L.R. 78 to compel the clerk to issue a certificate of approval of their subdivision plan or, alternatively, to annul the board's decision denying their application. The trial court dismissed the petition as time-barred. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal and held that the proceeding against the board was time-barred pursuant to N.Y Town Law &sect; 282 because it was not commenced within 30-days after the filing of the board's decision. The court found that the proceeding against the clerk was timely filed because the petitioners' challenge to the clerk's refusal to issue a default certificate was governed by the four-month limitation of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 217. The court determined that the clerk was not obligated to issue a default certification because the 45-day period within which the board had to act on the petitioners' proposal was tolled during the time the county reviewed the petitioners' application. The court found that, by virtue of this tolling, the board's denial of the application was within the required 45 days and the petitioners' demand for a default certification was properly rejected.</SPAN></P>

A proceeding to review a determination of a town planning board was time barred where the minutes of a November 4 board meeting were delivered to the board's office the next day and the proceeding was not commenced until December 16, since Town Law &sect; 282 provides that a proceeding seeking review of a town planning board decision must be commenced within 30 days after the decision is filed in the planning board office, and delivery of the minutes is equivalent to the &quot;filing of the decision&quot; so as to trigger the 30-day provision; moreover, the statute does not speak in terms of when the applicant is notified, but focuses on the filing with the board.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A town clerk is not obligated to issue a default certificate of subdivision approval pursuant to Town Law &sect; 276 (4), which, in effect, requires a town planning board to rule on a subdivision application within 45 days after a public hearing, notwithstanding the fact that more than 45 days have elapsed between the hearing and petitioners' demand for the issuance of the certificate, since the statute speaks to a plat submitted in final form and the application in question was not finalized until the town planning board actually received the written recommendation of the county planning board; not until receipt of that recommendation was the town board authorized to proceed on the application.  Moreover, by the town's own regulations, a &quot;final plat&quot; anticipates a subdivision proposal containing all information or detail required by law which if approved may be duly filed. Accordingly, the 45-day period was tolled pending review by the county, and by virtue of that tolling, the town board's denial was well within the required 45 days.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1975, the individual was diagnosed with a condition allegedly caused by her exposure to DES during her gestation some 20 years earlier. Following the passage of a revival statute (1986 N.Y. 682, &sect; 4), she filed suit against a manufacturer of the DES. In addition to a general denial, the manufacturer's answer asserted the action was time-barred as an affirmative defense. When the individual filed a motion to dismiss the defenses, the manufacturer cross-moved for summary judgment. While the motion was pending, the individual commenced similar actions against other manufacturers. At the supreme court's direction, the parties stipulated to consolidation and deeming the summary judgment motion on behalf of all the a manufacturers. Summary judgment was granted, and the individual appealed. On appeal, she argued that, inasmuch as &sect; 4 began with the words &quot;notwithstanding any other provision of law,&quot; N.Y.

The revival statute is conce rned solely with the harshness of a time bar that focused on a victim's exposure to a toxic substance, and not with the salutary purposes underlying the borrowing statute. Thus, barring plaintiff's claim will prevent the forum shopping CPLR 202 was enacted to prohibit and further the Legislature's interest in reviving the claims of New Yorkers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A plaintiff, who was allegedly injured as a result of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">in utero</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) and who lacks all contacts with New York save her establishing residency here prior to bringing suit, may not avail herself of the benefits of the Toxic Tort Revival Statute (L 1986, ch 682), which revived the claims of those persons injured by exposure to toxic substances who were denied a remedy by the effect of New York's preexisting &quot;last exposure&quot; rule, since the &quot;borrowing statute&quot; (CPLR 202), which requires that where a cause of action accrues outside New York in favor of a nonresident, the foreign Statute of Limitations applies if it is shorter than the applicable New York limitation period, applies; in passing the revival statute, the Legislature had no interest in reviving the claims of nonresident plaintiffs who were adequately protected under their own States' Statutes of Limitations, and it is noted that the instant plaintiff was exposed to DES in Pennsylvania and was diagnosed as suffering from such exposure in New Jersey, States whose limitations period begin to run upon discovery of the injury.  Thus, plaintiff did have a viable cause of action in another jurisdiction at some point in time.  The introductory phrase of the revival statute, &quot;Notwithstanding any other provision of law&quot;, can only mean that the CPLR's three-year limitations period on personal injury actions shall not apply to claims brought within the one-year &quot;window period&quot; in which to bring a revived action.</SPAN></P>

The &quot;borrowing statute&quot; (CPLR 202), which requires that where a cause of action accrues outside New York in favor of a nonresident, the foreign Statute of Limitations applies if it is shorter than the applicable New York limitation period, applies to causes of action brought pursuant to the Toxic Tort Revival Statute (L 1986, ch 682), which revived the claims of those persons injured by exposure to toxic substances who were denied a remedy by the effect of New York's preexisting &quot;last exposure&quot; rule and created a one-year &quot;window period&quot; in which to bring suit; the language of the revival statute that &quot;Notwithstanding any other provision of law&quot; the revival statute shall be applicable to toxic tort causes of action, does not bar application of CPLR 202.  Although the revival statute makes reference to other specific statutes as being inapplicable to toxic torts, their inclusion is consistent with the Legislature's intention to eliminate all vestiges of the &quot;last exposure&quot; rule judicially grafted onto CPLR 214 and should not be read as a purposeful omission of the &quot;borrowing statute&quot;, a statute of a wholly different nature which was designed to prevent forum shopping. Moreover, the failure to apply the &quot;borrowing statute&quot; would divest defendants of those vested rights created by the laws of sister States where the action would otherwise be barred.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the Commissioner properly determined that the police officer had violated each of the regulations. Although the regulation prohibiting conduct unbecoming a member of the department could conceivably be unconstitutionally overbroad and vague when applied to certain conduct, under the facts and circumstances of the case, the regulation was not unconstitutionally overbroad and vague as applied to the offending conduct engaged in by the officer.

The court disagreed with the first two allegations as it had the authority to delegate hearing powers to administrative entities, so long as judicial review remained. However, the court found persuasive the father's assertion that incarceration was improper. The court said the father proved he was financially unable to comply with terms of the support order and should have been relieved of the commitment order. The court found the father made partial payments, worked most of the time, and that he made several attempts to have the support order modified. Because of those factors the order of commitment was in error. The court concluded that to deprive him of liberty by commitment to prison, it was necessary to show the willful violation of a prior court order, by clear and convincing evidence. No such evidence was adduced, and incarceration was improperly ordered.</SPAN></P>

In a support proceeding, the assertion that respondent husband has waived his right to challenge the support order of a Hearing Examiner by failing to comply with the requirements of Family Court Act &sect; 439 (e), in that respondent did not submit written objections to such order to Family Court within 30 days, is unpersuasive; respondent is not precluded from appealing the propriety of such order by failing to submit such objections since the content of the Hearing Examiner's order is not in issue.  The issue is whether the Hearing Examiner lacked jurisdiction to hear the case and inasmuch as respondent timely appealed from an order of the Family Court dismissing that issue, the constitutionality of the Hearing Examiner's order is properly before the Appellate Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Family Court</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Hearing Examiners -- Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Family Court Act &sect; 439 is not unconstitutional insofar as it authorized the transfer of Family Court's powers from constitutionally elected Judges to nonjudicial, unelected employees of the Unified Court System, since NY Constitution, article VI, &sect; 30 vests broad power in the Legislature to make procedural rules for the courts, and the Legislature, in enacting section 439, has recognized the need to expand the powers of Hearing Examiners to expedite child support determinations.  Moreover, even if the authority vested in Hearing Examiners could be shown to infringe in some way upon the province of Family Court Judges, any such infringement would not be an unconstitutional grant of authority since the final authority to review determinations made by Hearing Examiners is reserved for Family Court Judges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Family Court -- Hearing Examiners -- Referral to Examiner in Another County</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a support proceeding, there is no merit to respondent's argument that a Hearing Examiner in one county improperly and without authorization determined issues pending in the Family Court in another county, where the Hearing Examiner in the latter county had been disqualified owing to the fact that he had been respondent's attorney in other Family Court proceedings; Family Court Act &sect; 439 (f) provides that counties may agree to share the services of Hearing Examiners, and, thus, the Family Court in one county had the authority to refer the matter to the Hearing Examiner in the other county, who then had jurisdiction to determine the support issues raised in the proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Support -- Willful Failure to Pay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In a support proceeding, there is merit to respondent's contention that he has shown his financial inability to comply with the terms of a support order and, thus, should be relieved of the order committing him to 15 weekends in jail, where Family Court's conclusions appear to be based on few facts in the record, which did disclose numerous attempts to successfully comply with the support order, including borrowing money or, in the alternative, to have the order modified so as to render compliance practicable.  Family Court's emphasis on respondent's alleged access to funds is not well founded.  The record does not demonstrate a failure to make payments accompanied by an absence of any attempt to modify the order of support, nor does it demonstrate the failure to use any part of respondent's wages to make payments; to deprive a person of liberty, the willful violation of a prior court order must be established by clear and convincing evidence, and such evidence was not presented.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With respect to petitioner employee's proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78, seeking reinstatement to his position as assistant in occupational education civil rights with respondent Department of Education, the department appealed the ruling of the supreme court (New York), which concluded that the employee was a non-probationary, permanent employee who could not have been terminated absent a hearing pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect;75.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was provisionally appointed to his position with the department. He subsequently passed a competitive examination for the assistant position, and an eligible list was established, upon which he ranked sixth. He was granted a permanent appointment to the assistant position subject to a flexible probationary period, which was extended. Then the department notified the employee of his summary termination. The employee sought reinstatement of his position. The supreme court ordered the employee's reinstatement with associated benefits. The court reversed the judgment and held that the petition should have been dismissed as untimely because any challenge to the probation requirements had to have been made within four months of the extension of the probationary term. Also, because the probationary term continued through the employee's termination, he was not entitled to a hearing prior to discharge. The employee did not become entirely eligible for a permanent appointment until the other candidates on the eligible list opted for other positions. Thus, the relevant probationary term began on that date.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A proceeding to review a determination of the Commissioner of Education terminating petitioner summarily from his position is untimely where it was commenced more than four months after petitioner was notified that his probationary period was to be extended </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, CPLR 217), since the case focuses upon the imposition of a term of probation to petitioner's permanent appointment, petitioner not having challenged the substantive basis for his dismissal.  By petitioner's own account, he had acquired tenure by the time of the probation extension, and inasmuch as that was a discretionary extension, it had an impact on petitioner's employment status. Consequently, any challenge to the probation requirements had to be made, at least, within four months of the extension, rather than within four months of petitioner's dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Appointment and Promotion -- Probationary Term -- Full Qualification</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding to review a determination of the Commissioner of Education terminating petitioner summarily from his position, the petition should be dismissed since there was no impropriety in petitioner's summary termination. Where a provisional employee, such as petitioner, is subsequently given a permanent appointment, the probationary term is properly measured from the point when the employee fully qualifies for the permanent position, thereby satisfying the constitutional mandate compelling appointments on the basis of &quot;merit and fitness&quot; (NY Const, art V, &sect; 6), and in light of the fact that petitioner was ranked sixth on the eligible list resulting from the competitive examination, he did not become entirely eligible for a permanent appointment until the higher ranking candidates on the eligible list opted for other positions.  Petitioner's permanent appointment coincided with the date the last candidate ahead of him so opted, and since petitioner's dismissal occurred within two years of that date, both sides concurring that two years was the maximum probationary period, petitioner was not entitled to a hearing prior to discharge.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, apartment dweller and New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), sought review of a decision of the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which granted respondent landlord a final judgment of possession against the apartment dweller and held that the DHCR's amendments to the Rent Stabilization Code, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 2523.5(b)(1), (2), were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord brought a holdover proceeding against the apartment dweller in a trial court. As an affirmative defense, the apartment dweller asserted that the landlord had conferred tenant status on him by accepting his rent checks.

The lower court granted possession to the landlord and held that the DHCR's amendments to the Rent Stabilization Code (Code), N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 2523.5(b)(1), (2), were invalid. The court reversed the lower court's judgment and reinstated the trial court's judgment. The court held that the enactment of &sect; 2523.5(b)(1), (2), was the product of a proper exercise of the DHCR's statutory authority to promulgate amendments to the Code; and that the apartment dweller, as the brother of a named tenant, was entitled to protection of &sect; 2523.5(b)(1).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provisions of the Rent Stabilization Code which provide that relatives who reside with a named tenant may succeed to the tenant's lease rights upon the tenant's death or abandonment of the dwelling (9 NYCRR 2523.5 [b] [1], [2]) are a proper exercise of the statutory authority of the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) to promulgate amendments to the Code; accordingly, a holdover proceeding against the brother of a sole tenant of record, who moved into the subject apartment at the commencement of the tenancy, is dismissed where the tenant of record subsequently vacated the premises and the brother began paying rent in his own behalf.  In amending the Code to confer succession rights on various family members, DHCR acted rationally and within the scope of its lawfully delegated authority, and in furtherance of its duty to alleviate the continuing critical shortage of housing in New York City.  If DHCR may, without the benefit of a statutory definition, define &quot;tenant&quot; in its rent stabilization regulations, and if, without an express statutory mandate to do so, succession provisions may be included in the State and city rent control regulations, DHCR may include either or both of those same provisions in the Code; having been delegated the authority for amending the Code, DHCR properly sought to promulgate regulations which would provide for succession rights to the family of a tenant residing in a rent-stabilized apartment in New York City.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the Nassau County Court (New York) which found appellant guilty of murder and burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant committed a murder while released from prison on parole. Appellant's failure to inform his parole officer that police had contacted him constituted a violation of appellant's parol conditions. Parole officer arrested appellant when they met because appellant again refused to state that he had been contacted. The police arrived and appellant willingly went to the station for questioning. Appellant was told and understood he was not under arrest for homicide. After being given his Miranda rights, appellant confessed. The court held the arrest of appellant by the parole officer was based upon probable cause that appellant had violated the conditions of parole, and that even if the arrest was considered illegal because no parole violation warrant had been issued, it did not amount to an unreasonable seizure and did not violate any constitutional rights. The court further found that any taint possibly caused by the arrest had dissipated prior to the confession at the police station.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Arrest -- Probable Cause -- Arrest of Parolee by Parole Officer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The arrest of a parolee by his parole officer was based upon probable cause to believe that the parolee had violated certain conditions of his parole where one of those conditions was that the parolee disclose any contact he may have with the police, and where it became apparent to the parole officer during an interview with the parolee that the latter was persisting in his failure to admit that he had had contact with the police, a contact which the parole officer was sure had occurred, having previously spoken with the police.  Accordingly, the arrest of the parolee by his parole officer was not an unreasonable seizure in contravention of constitutional standards (US Const 4th Amend, 14th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 12).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Arrest -- Warrantless Arrest of Parolee by Parole Officer -- Suppression of Confession</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a prosecution for murder &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and burglary, even if the arrest of defendant parolee is considered illegal because no parole violation warrant had been issued </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Executive Law &sect; 259-i [3] [a] [i]; 9 NYCRR 8004.2), the arrest did not amount to an unreasonable seizure and did not violate any of defendant's constitutional rights; accordingly, exclusion of defendant's subsequent confession to the police is not an appropriate remedy.  Exclusion from evidence of a voluntary confession is warranted only when it is shown that the confession was obtained in violation of a constitutionally protected right of the accused, and no such violation occurred because parolees have no constitutional right to be arrested only pursuant to a warrant.  Violation of the aforementioned statute requiring the issuance of a parole violation warrant does not require suppression of the confession since that statute is not jurisdictional, is not meant to protect the privacy of the public, affects no substantial right, and is purely a technical requirement.  The Constitution does not require the suppression of evidence gathered as a result of a seizure which is not unreasonable and, hence, not unconstitutional, solely on the grounds that &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the seizure may be considered violative of some State statute, ordinance or regulation, where no bad faith is shown on the part of the police and where the statute in question is not designed to implement Fourth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Confession -- Dissipation of Possible Illegal Taint</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a prosecution for murder and burglary, even assuming that the warrantless arrest of defendant parolee by his parole officer was so illegal as to warrant the application of the exclusionary rule, any taint caused by the arrest had dissipated prior to defendant's subsequent confession to the police, where the parole officer was not acting as an agent for the police, where the confession was preceded by a knowing and intelligent waiver of defendant's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights, and where there was a significant intervening event which occurred between the time of defendant's initial arrest and the time of his confession, i.e., defendant had been released after his initial arrest and was, thus, essentially free to choose between going with the police or not.  A reasonable person in defendant's position at the time of his transfer from the parole office to police headquarters would have thought &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  himself free to leave, so that at that point defendant was not in custody. Moreover, whatever misconduct may have been committed by the parole officer in arresting defendant without a warrant cannot be attributed to the homicide detectives who scrupulously respected defendant's rights at every turn; the parole officer was not acting as a conduit for the police and the arrest for a parole violation was not a pretext for the arrest of defendant on a charge of homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Arrest -- Custodial or Noncustodial Status of Defendant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a prosecution for murder and burglary in which defendant parolee was arrested by his parole officer without a warrant and then turned over to the custody of homicide detectives, the fact that defendant learned that he failed a polygraph test administered pursuant to the homicide investigation did not transform his noncustodial status into a custodial one, since defendant had been specifically advised by the polygraph examiner that he was free to leave police headquarters at any time and that in the eyes of the law the results of the polygraph test were worthless; the fact that defendant failed the polygraph merely elevated defendant's status &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as a suspect &quot;a little bit more&quot;, and it cannot be inferred that the police considered defendant to be in custody at that point since a reasonably intelligent and innocent man, under the circumstances, would not have concluded that, because of the polygraph test results alone, he would be physically restrained if he sought to leave.  Therefore, defendant was not under arrest at that point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parole -- Parole Violation Warrant -- Requirement for Arrest by Parole Officer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. There is no rule of constitutional law which requires that a warrant must be issued prior to the arrest of a parolee known to have committed a parole violation, and it would be anomalous to hold that parolees have a constitutional right to be arrested only upon a warrant, while probationers, whose status is comparable, do not have a similar right, particularly since as a general matter parolees are guilty of more serious crimes than those who receive probation.  The requirement that the arrest of a parole violator be preceded by the issuance of a warrant (Executive Law &sect; 259-i [3] [a] [i]) is more in the nature of a procedural or &quot;housekeeping&quot; rule than a requirement designed to protect individual liberty, and &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the type of warrant in question is not one issued by a neutral Magistrate, but is issued by an administrative officer who is basically a colleague of the officer who is seeking the warrant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 9 NYCRR 8004.2 [b]).  Moreover, the failure to obtain a parole violation warrant is particularly excusable where no decision had been made by the parole officer as to whether to revoke parole until the parolee was actually in the presence of the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Remain Silent -- Subjective Belief of Defendant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In a prosecution for murder and burglary, there is no merit to defendant's argument that his statements to police were extracted in violation of his privilege against self-incrimination on the grounds that he subjectively believed that if he did not tell the truth, his parole would be revoked; even assuming that the defendant had such a perception, it would not have been a reasonable one, because the State may not punish a parolee for invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege by revoking his parole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Confession -- Interrogation Technique -- Use of Polygraph</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In a prosecution for murder and burglary, the interrogation techniques employed by the police &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were not violative of due process; there was no abuse of a polygraph test since there is no evidence that the polygraph examiner deceived defendant with respect to the accuracy of the procedure or with respect to his own conclusions as to defendant's veracity.  </SPAN></P>

Law &sect; 3602(31), a school district was required to levy taxes at a &quot;real property tax equivalent rate&quot; (RPTER) that exceeded the previous year's rate by a certain percentage. The school district interpreted N.Y. Educ.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trade association sought review of an order from the Supreme Court in Albany County (New York), which denied a motion by defendants, the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Social Services and others, for summary judgment, and declared that N.Y.

N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 2(21). The individual plaintiffs each owned and operated an adult care facility. The trade association brought an action for a declaration that N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 487.11(l)(14)(viii) and (ix), a regulation of defendant Department of Social Services, was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to them. The regulation, fixing spatial requirements for single and double bedrooms in adult care facilities licensed and certified by the department by its operation provided for three classes of facility. The court held that the trade association failed to establish that the regulation was so lacking in reason for its promulgation that it was essentially arbitrary. The determination to permit preexisting single rooms of at least 85 square feet and double rooms of at least 70 square feet per resident but to phase out smaller rooms would have caused financial burden only to those whose facilities were substantially substandard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Office of General Services (OGS) (New York) denied the certification of petitioner corporation as a minority-owned business. The corporation brought this proceeding against respondent, Commissioner of the New York State OGS (commissioner), challenging the OGS determination. The corporation sought an order annulling the determination and requiring OGS to certify the corporation as a minority and women-owned business enterprise (M/WBE).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grounds for the corporation's challenge were that Executive Order No. 21 (Order), N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 4.21, and the OGS guidelines were unconstitutional; that the guidelines were not duly promulgated as a rule or regulation; that Order and the guidelines were invalidly adopted without statutory authority; that the corporation's procedural due process rights were violated due to the vagueness of the guidelines and the inadequacy of the procedures on the review of its application for certification; and that if the guidelines were valid, the denial of the corporation's application was irrational and inconsistent with the Order and the guidelines themselves. The court held that the corporation lacked standing because it had not suffered any personal injury fairly traceable to the Order that was likely to be redressed by the requested relief. Also, the corporation failed to avail itself of its right to a final administrative appeal, and had not brought itself within any of the exceptions to the doctrine that foreclosed judicial review to one who has not exhausted his administrative remedies. The guidelines were not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared that the guidelines for certification of M/WBE have not been shown to be invalid and the court thereby confirmed the OGS determination, and dismissed the remainder of the petition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A construction firm which is claiming status as a minority-owned business in order to take advantage of a State affirmative action program lacks standing to challenge the validity of an Executive Order which created a certification program and procedures to implement the affirmative action program, since petitioner is not aggrieved as it &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  might be were it not a nonminority business enterprise not eligible for favored treatment; petitioner has not suffered any personal injury fairly traceable to the Executive Order and may not complain of any injury which might be inflicted on others.  Inasmuch as standing goes to the jurisdictional basis of a court's authority to adjudicate a dispute, petitioner's challenge is subject to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">sua sponte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dismissal in spite of respondent's failure to raise the objection as to lack of standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies -- Affirmative Action Certification Procedure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The claim of a construction firm which asserted that it is a minority-owned business eligible to take advantage of a State affirmative action program and that the decision to deny its certification as a bona fide minority business enterprise lacks a rational basis is dismissed since petitioner failed to avail itself of its right to a final administrative appeal and has not brought itself within any of the exceptions to the doctrine that forecloses judicial review to one who has not exhausted his administrative remedies; a party does not avoid the exhaustion requirement merely by &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  asserting the deprivation of a constitutional right, and there is nothing to demonstrate that the alleged defects in procedures would not have been considered and cured at the final stage of the administrative appeal process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Declaratory Judgments -- When Remedy Appropriate -- Challenge to Affirmative Action Procedures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a proceeding challenging both the validity of an Executive Order, which created a certification program and procedures to implement an affirmative action program, and a determination denying petitioner certification as a minority-owned business enterprise, although petitioner was precluded from alleging that the determination lacked a rational basis owing to its failure to exhaust its administrative remedies, petitioner is not precluded on his remaining challenges, directed to the invalidity of certain guidelines (9 NYCRR part 340) promulgated to implement the Order, on the grounds of vagueness, lack of statutory authority, improper promulgation as a rule or regulation, and inconsistency of said guidelines with the Order, since each of those claims may be the proper subject of a declaratory judgment action, and the pertinent portions of the petition may &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be converted accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Construction Contracts -- Affirmative Action Guidelines -- Legislative Authorization</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a proceeding, converted to a declaratory judgment action, challenging the validity of certain guidelines which implement an Executive Order establishing an affirmative action program for minority and women-owned business enterprises, judicial notice may be taken that the guidelines were duly filed with the Secretary of State as 9 NYCRR part 340, and, thus, petitioner's objection with respect to their improper promulgation is foreclosed. Likewise, the guidelines are not subject to attack for lack of legislative authorization since the guidelines are expressly intended merely to create the procedures and criteria for certification for the affirmative action program authorized under the Prison Construction Act (L 1983, ch 56), and for similar programs &quot;as authorized by such other laws, rules, regulations and orders as they apply&quot; (9 NYCRR 340.1), and to implement the aforementioned Executive Order.  Insofar as the guidelines are used for certification purposes in connection with the affirmative action program under the Prison Construction Act, they have &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  statutory authority, and as to any other affirmative action program of the executive branch wherein the guidelines may be applied, petitioner has not shown that any of such programs are anything but voluntary; accordingly, lack of statutory authority for the use of the guidelines in connection with such voluntary affirmative action programs is not fatal to their validity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Construction Contracts -- Affirmative Action Guidelines -- Consistency with Enabling Executive Order</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Guidelines (9 NYCRR part 340) which implement an Executive Order establishing an affirmative action program for minority and women-owned business enterprises are not invalid by reason of any inconsistency with said Order, which is aimed expressly to insure that only bona fide minority business enterprises benefit from the program, since the definitional criteria for a minority business enterprise contained in the Order require that the ownership interest of minority persons in a business enterprise be &quot;real, substantial and continuing&quot;, and the guidelines are clearly designed to implement that policy.  Determining the actual independent control by the minority interest necessarily entails investigation &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  into the internal business practices of the enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Construction Contracts -- Affirmative Action Guidelines -- Vagueness Challenge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Guidelines (9 NYCRR part 340) which implement an Executive Order establishing an affirmative action program for minority and women-owned business enterprises are not invalid by reason of vagueness since each of the standards and criteria to which petitioner construction firm objects is clearly designed and appropriate to insure that minority persons claiming to own the business enterprises are in fact exercising actual, autonomous managerial control; persons of ordinary intelligence could readily understand what pattern of conduct of the affairs of the enterprise is necessary to avoid being disqualified from participation in the program, and given the obvious need for flexibility in providing standards to be applied in a myriad of business configurations, any more specificity in the guidelines would unduly weaken and inhibit the ability of the State to insure that only bona fide minority business enterprises receive the benefits of the Governor's program.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The towns and their officials and taxpayers filed an action for a judgment declaring unconstitutional the chapter laws, which required the use of 1970 census and 1969 assessment rolls, rather than the 1979 and 1980 figures, in apportioning state aid to localities for the fiscal years of 1981-1985. The trial court granted the state's motion for summary judgment. The towns, officials, and taxpayers appealed. The court affirmed, with costs. The court found that the state, by the affidavit of the director of its budget division, demonstrated that the revenue sharing methodology rationally furthered a legitimate state objective and did not violate equal protection. The court found that the legislature envisioned the use of the older figures as a means of supplementing per capita state aid to cities experiencing serious economic adversity, as manifested by population loss, at the expense of localities that were prospering with their population.</SPAN></P>

Equal protection does not require that all towns be treated alike and plaintiffs may not be heard to complain that the Legislature could have accomplished the same goals in a better or different way.

The court disagreed and upheld the supreme court's ruling declaring the ordinance void. The ordinance did not designate with any specificity the boundaries of the prohibited mining zones. Rather, the ordinance prohibited mining below the water table on all lands in the town, except in connection with construction of a building on the same lot. The ordinance's effect was not a general prohibition of mining in the town, or any specific area, but an express limitation of the mining process. The Town's characterization of the zoning ordinance as a permissible general land use regulation was inaccurate, as the ordinance was indistinguishable from another town's ordinance, governing the removal of earth and earth products, that the court deemed preempted by &sect; 23-2703(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff non-resident owner sought review of the judgment of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (New York), which granted a motion for summary judgment by defendants, and declared constitutional Town of Brookhaven, N.Y., Code &sect; 85-411, which provided for issuance of permits to a restricted number of single-family homeowners for the purpose of creating and maintaining accessory rental apartments within their owner-occupied homes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 85-411 allowed accessory apartments within homes situated in single-family residence zoning districts, limited the number of apartments within any given area, and provided for certain permit requirements, including owner occupancy. The non-resident owner sought a declaration that &sect; 85-411 was void and unconstitutional insofar as it required owner occupancy. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment, finding that the town did not exceed its legislative authority under N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 10. The court noted that a zoning measure was insulated from attack if it fell within the embrace of the town's authority to regulate property as a means of promoting the general welfare of the community, and that mere disparate treatment was not a sufficient basis for voiding a zoning provision. The court concluded that the distinction between homeowners who occupied their homes and those who did not was rationally related to the legitimate zoning goal of aiding occupying homeowners in retaining and maintaining their properties, while answering the need for affordable rental accommodations without disturbing the single-family-residence character of the affected districts.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance did not exceed the legislative powers granted to the town in Town Law &sect; 261; the town possessed broad zoning authority pursuant to Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 and, therefore, could enact laws which supersede the Town Law.</SPAN></P>

A town may lawfully enact a local law which, while providing for the issuance of permits to a restricted number of single-family homeowners for the purpose of creating and maintaining accessory rental apartments within their homes, limits the availability of those accessory apartment permits, and consequently the financial benefits which flow therefrom, to only those homeowners who also occupy their homes, and such law does not impermissibly regulate the user of the property rather than the use of the property, since the law does not attach a personal condition to any individual landowner, nor is it unrelated to the use of the property within the town.  The law constitutes a permissible accessory-use zoning provision and an accessory &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  use (i.e., a use incidental to and occasioned by the principal use of the premises) by its very nature ordinarily attaches to the occupancy of the premises rather than to the mere ownership thereof, so that the owner of a residence typically must occupy the premises in order to take advantage of the benefits offered by accessory-use legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to a shortage of single-room occupancy (SRO) housing, the city enacted New York, N.Y., Local Law 9. Subsequently, the supreme court consolidated the property owners' motions; converted their motions for injunctive relief to motions for summary judgment; granted the city's cross motion for summary judgment in the action, which sought invalidation of Local Law No. 9 upon the basis that it violated the environmental laws; and granted summary judgment for the property owners in the other actions upon the ground that the anti-warehousing, buy-out, replacement, and hardship provisions of Local Law No. 9 violated the property owners' due process rights and constituted a taking of their property for public use without just compensation. On appeal, the court found Local Law No. 9 was constitutional in all respects because it did not either constitute an unconstitutional taking of property or violate due process, in view of the fact that the provisions of that law were intended to accomplish the legitimate governmental goal of preventing homelessness and did not deny the property owners the opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on their property.</SPAN></P>

Local Law No. 9, following years of study and public hearings, was enacted to cope with a serious public emergency, i.e., the rise in the number of homeless persons, and while the law may temporarily diminish the value of an SRO property, it does not reduce the value of that property to the level where it would be an unconstitutional taking, since the law permits SRO owners to earn a return of 8.5% of the assessed value of the property and that figure was derived from the hardship provisions of the rent control laws, which have been held constitutional.  Moreover, the replacement and buy-out options of the law, which require SRO owners who wish to alter their buildings to either relocate affected tenants or contribute $ 45,000 &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to a housing development fund for each demolished unit, are neither exorbitant nor a disguised tax, since the $ 45,000 figure is the estimated cost of acquiring and rehabilitating an SRO unit, plaintiffs have offered no persuasive evidence that said sum is arbitrary or capricious, and said moneys will go directly into a special fund to develop low- and moderate-income housing; the requirement that property owners contribute to such special funds has been held not to constitute an unconstitutional &quot;taking&quot;.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), entered judgment dismissing the operators' application. The operators appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operators owned a 25-unit mobile home park. They applied to the town board for approval to expand the mobile home park by 48 units. The town board denied the application for expansion because the existing sewage disposal method used by the operators was contrary to Town of Knox, N.Y., Sanitary Code &sect; 10 (Town Code). In their subsequent combined proceeding, the operators argued that the Town Code was invalid as preempted by state law, unconstitutional, and inconsistent with state and county laws. In dismissing the proceeding, the trial court held that the town board's determination was rational and the Town Code was not inconsistent with the state and county codes because the Town Code set a higher standard for sewage disposal based on legitimate factors. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court, annulled the town board's determination, declared the Town Code invalid, and remitted because the Town Code's blanket proscription against the operator's method of sewage disposal removed the possibility of sewage disposal as allowed by the state and, therefore, was inconsistent with the state standards.</SPAN></P>

In an administrative proceeding examining charges of professional misconduct against a psychiatrist, respondent State Board of Regents did not exceed its statutory authority in applying the preponderance of the evidence standard to the findings of State Board for Professional Medical Conduct (the hearing committee) rather than the substantial evidence standard, as was done by the hearing committee; although the Board of Regents should have applied the substantial evidence standard because the psychiatrist was charged by the Office of Professional Medical Conduct in September 1981, Public Health Law &sect; 230 (10) (f) having been amended to provide that the preponderance &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the evidence standard should be used in hearings initiated after January 1985, respondent did not exceed its authority since the fact that it applied the &quot;preponderance&quot; standard in no way harmed petitioner.

Moreover, respondent's interpretation of the statutory provisions delineating its duties and powers </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Education Law &sect; 6510-a [2]) should be given deference and accepted since its actions were not unreasonable or irrational.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding to review a determination of the State Board of Regents adopting the findings of a hearing committee that petitioner psychiatrist was guilty of professional misconduct and imposing a penalty, petitioner's contention that respondent exceeded its authority by revising factual findings of the hearing committee by finding guilt by a preponderance of the evidence is without merit, since respondent is specifically charged by statute with deciding guilt by considering the transcript, exhibits, and other evidence </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Education Law &sect; 6510-a [2] [a], [b]); accordingly, respondent is empowered to examine the testimony &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in order to determine whether the person charged is guilty, and the determination of guilt herein by a preponderance of the evidence did not require respondent to make new factual findings.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a proceeding to review a determination of the State Board of Regents adopting the findings of a hearing committee that petitioner psychiatrist was guilty of professional misconduct and imposing a penalty, petitioner's claim that his equal protection rights have been violated &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  because prospective application of an amendment to Public Health Law &sect; 230 (10) (f), which sets out the evidentiary standard to be applied at hearings into charges of professional misconduct against physicians, creates unequal treatment of two classes of persons, one class to be adjudicated by a substantial evidence standard and the other to be adjudicated according to a preponderance of the evidence standard, is without merit; petitioner was not denied equal protection and is not aggrieved since respondent Board of Regents found guilt by a preponderance of the evidence, affording petitioner the benefit of the higher standard of proof.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a proceeding to review a determination of respondent State Board of Regents adopting the findings of a hearing committee that petitioner psychiatrist was guilty of professional misconduct and imposing a penalty, petitioner's argument that the findings of guilt were not supported by substantial evidence is without merit where the State's experts testified that petitioner's psychiatric evaluations of patients were inadequate, and respondent's determination was based upon its evaluation &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the massive amount of testimony adduced at the hearing; it was noted that the evaluation reports of petitioner with respect to the patients in issue did not conform to acceptable medical standards and petitioner's claim that that finding was not supported by the evidence owing to the conflicting testimony of his expert witnesses is equally without merit, since petitioner's challenge raises questions of credibility which are determined solely by respondent.  The record demonstrates substantial evidence to support respondent's determination, which is not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In a proceeding to review a determination of respondent State Board of Regents adopting the findings of a hearing committee that petitioner psychiatrist was guilty of professional misconduct and imposing a penalty, petitioner's contention that the hearing committee was biased because its chairperson, a psychiatrist, had known an expert witness for the State for 25 years is without merit where, upon objection by petitioner, the other members of the committee met separately and discussed the situation, determining that the chairperson &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  should remain; there was no error in that procedure.  The mere fact that the chairperson and a witness knew and associated with one another professionally does not in and of itself demonstrate bias; in any type of medical proceedings, members of the same medical specialty may by necessity often be members of the same organizations; moreover, the chairperson was also acquainted with two psychiatrists who testified for petitioner.  Petitioner has failed to demonstrate bias in the hearing committee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In a proceeding to review a determination by respondent State Board of Regents adopting the findings of a hearing committee that petitioner psychiatrist was guilty of professional misconduct and imposing a penalty, petitioner's contention that he was prejudiced by the joinder of the hearing into the charges against him with the hearing into charges against a surgeon who performed gender reassignment surgery on five patients whom petitioner had approved for such procedure, is unavailing where the relationship between petitioner and the surgeon involved common patients. In light of the fact that petitioner evaluated the patients and gave his &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  recommendation to the surgeon that they were appropriate candidates for the surgery, any investigation as to the adequacy of their treatment involved common factual issues, making joinder appropriate.  Moreover, separate hearings would have required duplication of much of the evidence that was submitted at the lengthy hearing; thus, consolidation preserved time and resources.  Petitioner was not prejudiced by the joinder since the hearing committee gave separate and independent consideration to the evidence with respect to him and the surgeon; petitioner's claim that joinder was prejudicial in that it held him to a standard of care of a primary treating physician is not persuasive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and Surgeons -- Disciplinary Proceedings -- Penalty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In a proceeding to review a determination of respondent State Board of Regents adopting the findings of a hearing committee that petitioner psychiatrist was guilty of professional misconduct and imposing a penalty of a three-year suspension, the last two years to be stayed, and a three-year probation, petitioner's assertion that the penalty was excessive is not persuasive; a court is restricted in its review of the propriety of sanctions &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  imposed against physicians and in light of the fact that respondent found serious deficiencies in petitioner's approval of patients for irreversible sex-change surgery without having adequately evaluated them, the punishment imposed is not shocking to one's sense of fairness, and, hence, not excessive.  </SPAN></P>

Section 5 of the Handicapped Children's Protection Act (Pub L 99-372; 100 US Stat 798), which provides for retroactivity with regard to the awarding of counsel fees to the parents or guardian of a handicapped child who is the prevailing party in an action pursuant to the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA; 20 USC &sect; 1400 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, is not an unconstitutional exercise of Congress' spending power, and the contention that EHA, as enacted in 1975, did not give notice to the States that they would be required to pay counsel fees as a condition of receiving &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Federal funds is without merit, since there is no question that the legislation at issue is clear and unambiguous.  Moreover, the retrospective grant of counsel fees does not constitute a legislative encroachment upon a judicial function, since EHA is not a simple funding statute; a motion for counsel fees requires an inquiry separate from the merits and such a motion does not imply a change in the judgment but merely seeks what is due because of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff builders commenced a proceeding to challenge defendant town's authority under N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect;&sect; 10, 11 to enact a Transportation Impact Fee Law (TIFL), which required all applicants for building permits who sought to make an improvement to land or change use of land that would generate additional traffic to pay a transportation impact fee at the time the permit was issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect;10(1)(i), which permitted local governments to adopt laws relating generally to their own property, affairs or government, did not authorize TIFL because TIFL had effects that went beyond the town's boundaries. The court noted that the imposition of a transportation impact fee would inhibit new construction within the town's boundaries and would shift new development to surrounding localities. The court further ruled that the town was not authorized under N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 10(1)(ii)(a)(6) to adopt TIFL because it did not relate to the acquisition, care, management and use of the town's highways, roads, streets, avenues and property, or under N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect;10(1)(ii) (a)(7), which permitted laws relating to the acquisition of transit facilities and the ownership and operation thereof. N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect;10(1)(ii)(a)(12) did not authorize the adoption of TIFL because it did not directly further the objective of public safety, but, rather, was aimed at raising revenues. The court also ruled that TIFL was inconsistent with and preempted by general laws regulating highway funding and municipal finance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rendered judgment in favor of the builders, holding that the town did not have statutory or constitutional authority to adopt TIFL and that the law was invalid for lack of such authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that it failed to state a crime pursuant to the statute, and the state appealed.

The form and content of the indictment complied with statutory requirements under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 200.50 and charged the perpetration of criminal conduct intended to be proscribed. The court held that the word &quot;procure&quot; in the context of &sect; 263.15 should be assigned its most natural and obvious meaning, that is, an intent to acquire, obtain, or to get possession of, and that the addition of the word &quot;procure&quot; as proscribed conduct in N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An indictment charging defendant with violating Penal Law &sect; 263.15, i.e., promoting a sexual performance by a child, is legally sufficient where the conduct defendant is accused of committing is the receipt and possession at his home of magazines and videotapes of children under the age of 16 engaging in various sex acts, since the statute proscribes the &quot;[promoting]&quot; of any sexual performance by a child, and &quot;promote&quot; is defined by Penal Law &sect; 263.00 (5) as meaning &quot;to procure&quot;, which in the context of the statutory framework should be assigned its most natural and obvious meaning: an intent to acquire or get possession of.  The addition of the word &quot;procure&quot; as proscribed conduct is indicative &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Legislature's determination to combat child pornography, which produces physical or psychological harm to the children involved, thereby rendering irrelevant the issue of whether the proscribed material is distributed commercially or possessed privately. A State has wider leeway in regulating child pornography in light of a State's compelling interest in safeguarding the well-being of minors, and the insertion of the word &quot;procure&quot; into section 263.00 (5) some years after the enactment of Penal Law article 235 dealing with obscenity, indicates a specific intent to expand and enlarge the meaning of the word &quot;promote&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owner brought an action against respondent municipality seeking, among other things, a review of the tax assessment of his property and a declaratory judgment invalidating the respondent's method of reassessing the value of real property only upon resale. The trial court denied petitioner's motion for summary judgment despite respondent's failure to serve an answer in a timely fashion. On appeal, the court concluded that respondent's practice involving the selective reassessment of real property upon a transfer thereof violated the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions because it permitted similarly situated properties to be taxed unequally with no demonstration that the unequal treatment was rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate governmental purpose.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Assessment -- Assessment of Property upon Transfer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The practice of a local taxing unit involving the selective reassessment of real property upon a transfer thereof violates the Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions (US Const 14th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 11) because it permits similarly situated properties to be taxed unequally with no demonstration that the unequal treatment is rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate governmental purpose; accordingly, petitioner property owner's assessment based upon the invalid method of reassessment must be vacated and the matter remitted &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for a new assessment. The taxing unit's disparate treatment of new property owners on the one hand and long-standing property owners on the other has the effect of permitting property owners who have been long-standing recipients of public amenities to bear the least amount of their cost.  It appears that the sole purpose of the different classes is to serve administrative convenience by relieving the locality of the burden of conducting a total review of the tax roll, and that method lacks any rational basis in law and results in invidious discrimination between owners of similarly situated property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding in which petitioner property owner is challenging the constitutionality of the practice of the local taxing authority whereby real property is reassessed only when there has been a transfer of title, petitioner's challenge is clearly based upon an allegation that respondents' method of reassessing property values is erroneous and, thus, the activity challenged should properly be reviewed by way of a collateral proceeding; pursuant to CPLR 103 (c), the court may remedy procedural infirmities by converting &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the instant RPTL article 7 proceeding into a CPLR article 78 proceeding.  Although taxpayer challenges to a real property assessment are generally restricted to a proceeding under RPTL article 7 and petitioner's first cause of action may be deemed within the purview of that law, petitioner's second cause of action challenges the method of reassessment and seeks a declaration of its invalidity, and article 7 does not contemplate that type of challenge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a proceeding in which petitioner property owner challenged the constitutionality of the practice of the local taxing authority whereby real property is reassessed only when there has been a transfer of title, respondents' failure to respond to petitioner's service of a notice to admit was at their peril, since petitioner sought to obtain admissions by means of that procedural device and not by way of RPTL 712 (1).</SPAN></P>

In a proceeding in which petitioner property owner challenged the constitutionality of the practice of the local taxing authority whereby real property is reassessed only when there has been a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  transfer of title, relevant factual allegations must be deemed admitted for purposes of the action where petitioner served a notice to admit upon respondents who failed to respond, since the fact sought to be elicited, i.e., whether respondents only reassess property upon its transfer, could be readily admitted or denied, and an admission pertaining to the method of assessing the value of petitioner's property is of the type contemplated by CPLR 3123 (a).  Moreover, respondents' opposition to petitioner's motion for summary judgment leaves no room for doubt that the methodology applied by respondents did involve only reassessing recently transferred properties, since respondents did not deny that practice.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, putative class of mental patients (mental patients), sought review of the decision of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York.) granting a motion to dismiss their complaint for failure to join a necessary party and lack of subject matter jurisdiction in favor of defendants, state mental hospital and its officials, in the mental patients' action seeking a declaration that N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 29.23 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state mental hospital (hospital) was appointed as representative payee to receive the mental patients' social security benefits after certifying that the mental patients were incapable of handling their own funds and without affording them prior notice or an opportunity to dispute the certification. Portions of the benefits were applied to the cost of their care and maintenance at the hospital. The mental patients brought an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and also sought the return of money representing payments to the hospital on their behalf. The trial court granted the hospital's motion to dismiss. On review, the court reversed the decision. The court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint for failure to join the federal secretary of human services because the complaint was narrowly drawn to challenge only the state law governing the procedure whereby a state mental facility certified patients as incompetent to manage their own funds and then controlled those funds. The trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction because it was the proper forum for a claim seeking a declaration regarding the constitutionality of a statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision dismissing the mental patients' complaint and held that the trial court should have exercised jurisdiction over the mental patients' claims for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from an order and judgment of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (New York), which permanently enjoined them from operating an adult bookstore at certain premises in accordance with a town ordinance, Islip, New York Town Code &sect; 68-341.1(B). The trial court granted a stay of the order and judgment pending the outcome of the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was the constitutionality of an ordinance that relegated defendants' adult bookstore to the town's industrial district. The court held that the ordinance was not aimed at the content of the books sold but was in the nature of a time, place and manner restriction, and that the ordinance was constitutionally permissible. However, the court reversed the part of the judgment that declared the provision of Town of Islip Code 68-341.1 requiring a special exception, constitutionally valid and substituted a declaration that the special exception requirement was unconstitutional. The town could not impose an additional barrier to the relocation of the bookstore in an Industrial I zone by vesting unfettered discretion in the zoning board to grant or deny a special exception permit. The ordinance relocated but did not ban adult establishments and, therefore, did not impermissibly abridge the liberty of speech under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The ordinance imposed a time, place and manner restriction upon the operation of adult business in a reasonable attempt to preserve the quality of community life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A town ordinance which relegated the location of an adult bookstore, defined as an establishment which sells books, films, etc., and excludes any minor by reason of age, to the town's industrial zoning district does not offend the United States Constitution since the ordinance is not aimed at the content of the books sold but is in the nature of a constitutionally permissible time, place and manner restriction; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the ordinance, which was enacted after extensive studies, is not aimed at the content of the books but, rather, at the effect of the bookstore upon the community and its quality of life.  The ordinance is designed to serve a substantial governmental interest, viz., to prevent the type of &quot;skid-row&quot; environment caused by proliferation of sex-oriented businesses, and it provides reasonable alternative locations within the town for adult-use establishments, there being sufficient industrial zoned property dispersed throughout the town so that the spatial limitations (i.e., no such establishment to be situated near schools, residences, etc., or near another such establishment) do not operate to foreclose all adult bookstores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- State Constitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A town ordinance which relegates the location of adult bookstores to the town's industrial zoning district and provides that no such store may be situated near schools, residences, etc., or near another such store does not offend NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 8, which declares that no law shall be passed to restrain the liberty of speech, since the rationale upholding the time, place and manner &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  restrictions on adult bookstores set forth by the United States Supreme Court is sound and withstands scrutiny under the State Constitution; the ordinance in question does not ban adult establishments and, therefore, does not impermissibly abridge the liberty of speech, and there is no prior restraint upon the bookstore's owners' constitutionally protected right to disseminate adult books and other materials.  The time, place and manner restrictions are a reasonable attempt to preserve the quality of community life, and the State's interest in ensuring a balance between the right of an adult bookstore to remain in business and the right of a town to protect its business districts from the spectre of &quot;skid-row&quot; deterioration is well served.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Regulation of Adult Bookstores -- Vagueness and Overbreadth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A town ordinance which relegates the location of adult bookstores to the town's industrial zoning district and provides that no such store may be situated near schools, residences, etc., or near another such store is not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, since a person of ordinary intelligence is given fair notice of what conduct &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is forbidden and explicit standards are set forth to preclude arbitrary and discriminatory application.  The ordinance relocates, but does not proscribe, constitutionally protected speech or conduct, is limited to establishments which exclude minors by reason of age, and reasonably confines its application to those establishments found to have a secondary detrimental effect on the community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.

However, the special exception provision is superfluous and does not affect the constitutionality of the remainder of the ordinance, and in light of the severability clause in the ordinance, which is an express statement by a legislative body that the valid provisions of the ordinance should be enforced, the constitutionally offensive special exception provision is severed and declared unconstitutional, and the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rest of the ordinance permitted to stand.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Peddlers who sold flowers along the town's streets sought a declaration that the ordinance which excluded them from certain prohibited streets was unconstitutional because its real purpose was to protect retail florists from competition. The ordinance's stated purposes were protecting the peace of citizens in their homes, protecting consumers from fraud, and the prevention of congestion and unsafe conditions in the streets. The parties stipulated that the streets on the prohibited list had heavy traffic. The court held that the peddlers had failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality that applied to local ordinances. The regulation of street use to prevent traffic congestion was a legitimate exercise of the town's police power and the peddlers had not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the ordinance was enacted for any impermissible reason. If any state of facts, whether known or assumed, justified the ordinance, its constitutionality would be upheld. The evidence before the trial court indicated that the ordinance was rationally related to its stated purposes of preventing interference with the movement of traffic and unsafe conditions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was adjudicated by the trial court as a second felony offender based on his prior conviction for attempted robbery in the third degree.

On appeal, the court vacated the sentences imposed by the trial court, determined that defendant was a first felony offender, and reduced his sentences. Although the 10-year limitations period under &sect; 70.06 limited the determination of second felony offense status to convictions for felonies within the 10 previous years, subject to tolling if defendant was imprisoned, that tolling provision contemplated that defendant had not been imprisoned without reason or unconstitutionally.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

Moreover, a finding of guilt with respect to violating DR 1-102 (A) (5), which prohibits conduct prejudicial to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the administration of justice, and DR 1-102 (A) (6) is not multiplicious where the finding arises out of the same conduct, since the willful and intentional failure to comply with the subpoenas and order to show cause constituted a violation of each rule.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a health care providers association and individual facilities, challenged the judgment of the Supreme Court in Albany County (New York), which granted a motion by defendants, social services department and intervenor, for summary judgment declaring that N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect;&sect; 131, 131-o and 18&nbsp;N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect;&sect; 485.12, 487.6 were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statutes and regulations in question established personal allowance accounts for adult care facility residents that received public assistance. The court affirmed the finding of constitutionality, determining that the trial court properly found that the statutes and regulations in question did not violate equal protection or due process guarantees. Plaintiffs contended that the federal government was permitted to recoup Federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) overpayments made due to its miscalculation and permitted residents to use personal allowance grants by buying any items they wish from other merchants. Plaintiffs further argued that the provisions penalized only adult care facility operators, who were denied access to personal allowance accounts to pay for any shortfalls in agreed-upon payments resulting from SSI benefit reductions. The court found that the challenged provisions were a proper exercise of the state's police power to protect elderly citizens. The state had an affirmative duty to aid the needy and there was a rational basis for the guarantee of a monthly allowance of a given amount to adult care facility residents to purchase personal necessities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Social Services Law &sect;&sect; 131 and 131-o and 18 NYCRR 485.12 and 487.6, which establish personal allowance accounts for adult care facility residents who receive public assistance, do not violate equal protection or due process guarantees of the operators of adult care facilities; the challenged provisions, which provide that the accounts are for the exclusive use of the residents of adult care facilities in purchasing basic personal items and that adult home operators are prohibited from using any portion of those accounts to compensate them for services provided, are a proper exercise of the State's police power to protect elderly citizens.  The State has an affirmative duty to aid the needy and there is a rational basis for the guarantee of a set sum of money per month to adult care facility residents &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to purchase personal necessities.  Merchants from whom residents choose to make purchases do not occupy a position very different from facility operators in regard to the use of personal allowance funds since residents may buy needed personal items from the facility operators, as well as from other vendors, if they so choose.  Moreover, it appears that an adult care facility resident's Supplemental Security Income benefits would not be reduced to recoup prior overpayments if such reduction would result in termination of an admission agreement, thereby rendering unavailing the operators' argument that they need to invade such funds of &quot;overpaid&quot; residents or terminate their admission agreements for failure to make timely payments for charges they agreed to pay.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prohibition does not lie to obtain collateral review of an order directing a suspect in a homicide investigation to supply corporeal evidence, i.e., a dental cast impression; inasmuch as the order challenged is equivalent to the issuance of a search warrant, use of the writ of prohibition would violate the well-established rules governing use of the writ and defeat the underlying policies of limiting proliferation of litigation in criminal cases and avoiding consequent delays in investigation and prosecution.  The order was issued by a Judge who had jurisdiction to entertain the District Attorney's application and petitioner's challenge to the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  order, that it was issued on less than probable cause, merely asserts a substantive error of law and does not demonstrate that the court exceeded its power.  Moreover, the harm sought to be prevented, that petitioner submit to a dental cast impression, does not justify issuance of the extraordinary writ inasmuch as the procedure is safe and the intrusion minimal; permitting collateral review of a discovery order is totally at odds with standard criminal procedure and the order, like any probable cause determination, may be challenged by a suppression motion and reviewed on direct appeal if petitioner is convicted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant book store appealed its conviction from the Broome County Court (New York) for two counts of obscenity in the third degree alleging that the definition of obscenity was vague to the point of denying defendant due process and that the state's obscenity law violated free speech rights under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on two counts of obscenity as the result of its sale of two sexually explicit magazines in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 235.00(1) and 235.05. The court modified the judgment by combining the two counts into one explaining that the single sale of two magazines, though separately wrapped and priced, constituted but one count of promoting obscene material. The court affirmed the judgment as modified rejecting defendant's constitutional claims that its due process rights were violated because the definition of obscenity under &sect; 235.00(1) was vague and that its free speech rights were broader under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 than its rights under the parallel provision of the U.S. Constitution. The court explained that obscenity as defined under the statute was not impermissibly vague and was easily interpreted as pertaining to hard core pornography by providing a reference point and incorporating the terms used by the United States Supreme Court to define obscenity. Further, defendant provided no compelling historical basis for extending the First Amendment protection under the state constitution beyond the protection provided under its Federal counterpart.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Penal Law &sect; 235.00, which defines obscene material, is not unconstitutionally vague since it is easily interpreted as pertaining to hard core pornography and is a codification of the criteria set forth by the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miller v California</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (413 U.S. 15); by incorporating the yardstick of &quot;contemporary community standards&quot;, the statute provides a reference point, and by reinterpreting &quot;utterly without socially redeeming value&quot;, it employs terms whose breadth work in a defendant's favor.  The very use of those terms by the United States Supreme Court in defining obscenity has been deemed authority for the proposition that they are not impermissibly vague. Moreover, defendant, which was convicted of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  obscenity, has not demonstrated that the free speech provision of the State Constitution (NY Const, art I, &sect; 8) is broader than the First Amendment; not only has the State Court of Appeals declined on at least two occasions to fashion a free speech/obscenity demarcation different from the Federal standard, but the fact that selling and promoting obscenity has been a crime in New York for some 120 years lends additional force to the presumption that the statute is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Instructions -- Obscenity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an obscenity prosecution, the trial court did not err in instructing the jury to determine obscenity based upon the community's &quot;acceptance&quot; of the particular materials in question; although the word &quot;tolerance&quot; would have been a better choice, &quot;acceptance&quot; has been condoned and a fair reading of the jury charge conveys the properly broad meaning of acceptance.  In any event, inasmuch as defendant had not appealed the jury's finding that its magazines were substantively obscene, the court must assume they are and, thus, if there was error, it was harmless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Obscenity -- Single Sale of Two Magazines</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a prosecution for obscenity, the single &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sale of two magazines, though separately wrapped and priced, constituted but one count, not two, of promoting obscene material </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, CPL 40.20 [2]); however, inasmuch as defendant was sentenced concurrently on each count, the error in failing to combine the counts was harmless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Obscenity -- Evidence -- Foundation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a prosecution in which defendant was convicted of obscenity in the third degree, defendant's contention that in an effort to demonstrate prevailing community standards it should have been permitted to introduce comparable magazines received in evidence at an earlier trial in the same county wherein the jury acquitted a local bookstore of obscenity in the second degree, is without merit since defendant had to establish a foundation demonstrating both similarity of the material and reasonable community acceptance; however, the earlier not guilty verdict does not equate to acceptability, but merely says that the People did not prove every element of their case beyond a reasonable doubt. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Commissioners implemented affirmative action programs that favored disadvantaged business enterprises, following a congressional finding that minorities were denied effective participation in public contracts. A contractor filed an action against the commissioners, seeking a declaration that the commissioners' programs were illegal and unlawful because the commissioners acted without legislative authority, because they violated the administrative procedure act, and because the programs denied the contractor equal protection. The trial court partially granted the contractor's motion for summary judgment, but upheld the constitutionality of the programs, and the parties filed cross-appeals. The court initially noted that the potential effect on the contractor's ability to participate in government contracts warranted a recognition of standing to challenge the commissioners' programs. As to the merits, the court held that a two-prong analysis established that the programs were narrowly tailored to achieve their goals. However, the trial court had not properly explored whether the programs were justified by a compelling governmental interest, such as remedying past discrimination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing of Contractor to Challenge Affirmative Action Program for Awarding State Construction Contracts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A domestic corporation which supplies materials and services as both a general contractor and subcontractor for public improvement projects has standing to challenge affirmative action programs implemented by the State to give minority and women-owned businesses a greater share of State construction contracts, since plaintiff seeks to preserve its right to compete for public contracts on the same terms as others, an interest the Equal Protection Clause may protect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, NY Const, art I, &sect; 11), since plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  affirmative action programs may have a harmful effect upon its ability to obtain contracts because of the preference to be given to minority and women-owned firms, and since there is no perceptible legislative intent to bar review of the State programs.  While the allegations of injury are concededly vague, standing need not be justified by injury-in-fact in every instance.  Accordingly, the potential effect on plaintiff's ability to participate in government contracts warrants a recognition of standing to challenge the State programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Construction Contracts -- Affirmative Action Programs -- Legislative Authorization</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is sufficient legislative authorization for the State Department of Transportation to implement an affirmative action program designed to award a greater share of construction contracts to minority and women-owned businesses with respect to Federally funded highway projects, since the Legislature, in Highway Law &sect; 85, expressly authorized the Department to pursue all measures necessary to comply with the Federal aid highway acts and accompanying regulations, which require that affirmative action programs be implemented. Moreover, Transportation &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Law &sect; 428 (1) requires the Department to comply with &quot;federal laws relative to participation of minority and women-owned business enterprises&quot; where Federal financial assistance is received on transportation infrastructure projects.  Accordingly, those statutory provisions provide clear legislative authorization regarding Federally funded projects.</SPAN></P>

In an action challenging the State's implementation of affirmative action programs for exclusively State-funded construction contracts on the grounds that the Governor has failed to act pursuant to the authority granted by Transportation Law &sect; 428 (2), the court shall take judicial notice of the Governor's letter and the regulations promulgated and filed at the Governor's direction where those regulations and letter were not before the Supreme Court and are dehors the certified record on appeal, since judicial notice may be taken of matters of public record, including regulations filed by a State agency ( CPLR 4511 [a]) and official Executive memoranda.  Inasmuch as an appellate court is required to apply the law as it exists at the time of appeal, it is appropriate to take &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judicial notice of the Governor's letter and the filed regulations, particularly since the latter are remedial and prospective in nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Construction Contracts -- Affirmative Action Programs -- Authorization by Governor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. An affirmative action program applicable to exclusively State-funded contracts and implemented by the State Department of Transportation has been legislatively authorized in light of the action taken by the Governor pursuant to Transportation Law &sect; 428 (2) in transmitting a letter empowering and directing the Department to implement such a program in accord with attached procedures and guidelines; in light of the Governor's further authorization of the Department to adopt procedures and guidelines necessary to administer the program, the only barrier to the program has been cleared, and the Department subsequently filed the appropriate regulations with the Secretary of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Construction Contracts -- Affirmative Action Program -- Prison Construction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Affirmative action programs implemented by the State Office of General Services (OGS) with respect to prison construction contracts have been legislatively authorized since the Prison &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Construction Act (L 1983, ch 56, &sect; 12) expressly requires each contracting agency to implement an affirmative action program for contracts it finances; to effectuate its provisions, the Act specifically charges OGS with monitoring such programs.  Thus, the OGS program enjoys clear legislative authorization with respect to contracts funded by the Act.  With respect to other OGS construction contracts, OGS adopted regulations which confirm that its affirmative action program is entirely voluntary </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 9 NYCRR part 342).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In an action challenging the implementation by the State of affirmative action programs designed to give minority and women-owned businesses a greater share of State construction contracts, plaintiff's contention that the State statutes in question (Highway Law &sect; 85; Transportation Law &sect; 428) incorporate by reference various Federal acts in violation of NY Constitution, article III, &sect; 16 is without merit, since the State acts merely authorize State officials to comply with the relevant Federal guidelines; moreover, the State officials are not acting under a Federal delegation of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  authority but under direction from the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Construction Contracts -- Affirmative Action Programs -- Federally Funded Contracts -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Affirmative action programs implemented by the Department of Transportation and designed to award minority and women-owned businesses a greater share of State construction contracts do not deprive plaintiff contractor of equal protection of the laws under NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 11 insofar as those programs relate to Federally funded contracts, since the regulations implementing those programs are statutorily authorized and necessary to ensure the continued receipt of Federal highway funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Construction Contracts -- Affirmative Action Programs -- State-Funded Contracts -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In an action challenging the implementation by the State of affirmative action programs designed to give minority and women-owned businesses a greater share of State contracts, the State, in addressing the contention of plaintiff contractor that such programs deny it equal protection, is obligated to establish a firm basis for the remedial action taken since there must be some showing of prior discrimination &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the government unit involved before allowing limited use of racial classifications in order to remedy such discrimination.  Consequently, inasmuch as findings have yet to be made as to whether the State engaged in any past discriminatory practices in the construction industry, the lower court not having reached plaintiff's equal protection challenge, the matter should be remitted to Supreme Court for a factual determination of whether the challenged programs have a legitimate remedial purpose.  It is noted that while racial classifications must be &quot;narrowly tailored&quot; to achieve the stated goal, a lesser standard of judicial review pertains to women-owned business enterprises, which focuses on whether the means employed are &quot;substantially related&quot; to the goal of alleviating past discrimination.  Moreover, although the State is not required to show actual instances of prior unlawful discrimination, there must be convincing evidence that the program in question is appropriate to remedy apparent discrimination, and statistical evidence of an abrupt disparity between actual participation of minority business concerns in public contracts and the percentage of qualified minority businesses &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the relevant labor pool should suffice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Construction Contracts -- Affirmative Action Programs -- Constitutionality of Good-Faith Efforts to Fulfill Minority Participation Requirements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. An affirmative action program implemented by the State Department of Transportation and designed to give minority and women-owned businesses a greater share of construction contracts passes constitutional muster where the program does not impose a fixed, mandatory set-aside, but simply requires contractors to utilize &quot;good faith&quot; efforts in fulfilling participation requirements; the inherent flexibility of the program limits the detrimental impact on nonminority contractors, and because the program is subjected to annual review, the lack of a specific durational limit is not fatal.  </SPAN></P>

Excess insurer was also required to maintain a stabilization reserve fund, which it could use to offset deficits, pursuant to N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 5509(a). At the end of 1985, excess insurer transferred the stabilization reserve fund to its premium account to offset its deficit. Then, the State legislature passed the amendment to the Act, requiring excess insurer to return the stabilization funds. All parties agreed that excess insurer was operating at a deficit. The court held that the trial court did not err in granting the motion for a preliminary injunction, as excess insurer was ultimately likely to succeed on the merits. Specifically, an appropriation of the stabilization fund, in which excess insurer had a vested property right, would have constituted an unconstitutional deprivation of property in violation of due process. Moreover, the court held that enforcement of the amendment would have caused irreparable harm to excess insurer, as without an injunction, excess insurer would have been unable to recoup the distributed funds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It is appropriate, when the constitutionality of a statute is challenged, to issue an injunction prohibiting the implementation of the statute pending litigation, since to withhold relief and allow illegal enforcement of an unconstitutional statute would strip a litigant of a constitutionally protected right and defeat the purpose of the declaratory action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although the Legislature has the prerogative to regulate the insurance industry, the right to regulate by exercise of the State's police power is not absolute, and where a statute would have retroactive effect, courts shall scrutinize the legislation more closely to examine whether the law is reasonably calculated to serve a compelling public interest, and the extent to which retrospective application creates unfairness.  Moreover, a regulated entity cannot be compelled to carry on its business at a loss, and retroactive legislation may not impair or destroy vested rights.  Accordingly, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the interest of the Medical Malpractice Insurance Association, a nonprofit unincorporated association created by the Legislature to deal with the malpractice insurance crisis in New York, in a stabilization reserve fund is not a mere unilateral expectation but rather a legitimate claim of entitlement to those funds already collected from its insureds, deposited in said fund, and intended and used to offset its deficit; the Association's interest in the fund is a property interest upon which the Association has and continues to rely, a reliance that must not be arbitrarily undermined.</SPAN></P>

The right of the Medical Malpractice Insurance Association, a nonprofit unincorporated association created by the Legislature to deal with the medical malpractice insurance crisis in New York, to maintain and use the amounts collected for its stabilization reserve fund, i.e., a fund representing collections on excess insurance policies and applied as authorized by statute to offset operating deficits, is founded upon Insurance Law &sect; 5509 (a), which explicitly stated that &quot;[the] fund &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shall be used for payment to the association of any deficit&quot;, and, thus, the statute expressly manifests the Association's property right in amounts collected for the stabilization reserve fund. The Association is not a State agency and its assets are not the property of the State: the reserve fund is administered solely by the Association and not by any governmental entity; the Association is the exclusive custodian of the fund, and the State does not assume liability for inadequacies in the fund.  Thus, Laws of 1986 (ch 266, &sect; 11), which requires the association to refund to hospitals stabilization reserve fund charges, constitutes an unconstitutional deprivation of property in violation of due process, and amounts to forcing the association, a regulated entity operating, as is conceded by all parties, at a loss, to carry on its business at a loss, a concept repugnant to constitutional protections of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the property owners began building a pool and deck in an area designated &quot;historical residential district,&quot; construction was halted because a permit was required under the city's zoning ordinance.

As a result, the property owners brought a declaratory judgment action against the city, claiming the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. Following a verdict for the city, review was sought, and the court affirmed and reversed. In affirming, the court held the ordinance was constitutional because its standards were sufficiently precise and objectively verifiable to give fair notice and provide minimal guidelines to safeguard against arbitrary enforcement and were clearly consistent with the legitimate legislative purposes of historic district regulation.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A city zoning ordinance which establishes an historic residential district is not unconstitutionally vague where it delineates standards which generally require compatibility of any new construction or alteration with existing structures &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of historic or architectural value on or nearby the property on which construction is proposed and with the environment of open spaces in the surrounding neighborhood; a municipality may validly impose historic district regulations designed to maintain the esthetic or cultural character of an area, and the standards in the ordinance in question are sufficiently precise and objectively verifiable to give fair notice and provide minimal guidelines to safeguard against arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement, and are clearly consistent with the legitimate legislative purposes of the regulation. Accordingly, the city's Historic District Commission could rationally conclude that the pool and deck, which petitioners wish to construct and which would be massive in size and distinctly contemporary in appearance, would be incompatible with the esthetic, cultural and historic character of their property and surrounding area unless modified in accordance with the conditions imposed by the Commission for approval; moreover, the Commission reasonably interpreted the definition of &quot;structure&quot; in the ordinance to include the installation of the pool and deck.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners' submission of revised plans was either the final completion of their original application or constituted a new application which the municipality's Historic District Commission accepted and determined as such, regardless of petitioners' noncompliance with the technical formalities required for such an application, and in either case, the ordinance provides no basis for dispensing with the time deadline; the record shows that the Commission failed to take final action on petitioners' application within the time limit and, thus, that untimeliness must be deemed to constitute approval.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee successfully appealed his medical disqualification for a promotion. However, the eligible list for the position expired shortly after the employee obtained the favorable opinion. In response, the employee requested placement on a special eligible list for the position. The director denied the request and claimed a lack of authority to establish a special eligible list, and the employee's eligibility terminated with the expiration of the eligible list. In his subsequent petition, the employee contended that the director and department's action in refusing the employee's request for placement on a special eligible list deprived him of his right to due process, and was also arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. On appeal, the court found that there was merit to the employee's claim that he was the victim of an improper enforcement of a statutory time limitation. The court concluded that N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 50(4) and New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect; 812(c) provided the employee with the right to appeal his medical disqualification, and the department and director were prohibited from depriving the employee of that right without statutorily mandated notice.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner is the victim of an irrational distinction: should he pursue a judicial remedy prior to the expiration of the eligible list, but before the administrative appeal process is completed, his court action would be subject to dismissal for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies; however, should he pursue his administrative remedies and be successful, all the appointing agency need do is delay the appointment until the expiration of the eligible list and petitioner would not have standing to bring a judicial action inasmuch as he would not be aggrieved. Consequently, the unsuccessful administrative appellant would be in a more favorable position to pursue judicial relief, since he would at least have standing to protect his property right to be considered for appointment; that right would be rendered a nullity if the successful administrative appellant could be foreclosed from appointment merely by an agency's delay.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The graduate suffered from a learning disability known as dyslexia. The law examiners gave the graduate additional time to complete the bar examination and allowed him to mark answers on the question sheet. The graduate did not pass the bar examination. The law school graduate requested a waiver of the written bar examination requirement, which was denied. The law school graduate filed a complaint seeking a declaration that the bar examination requirement was void as applied to him because it violated the Equal Protection Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 and violated a right conferred by N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 296(1)(a). The trial court granted the law examiners' motion to dismiss because the actions were time barred. The law school graduate appealed, and the court affirmed the order as modified. The court held that the four-month statute of limitations applicable to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceedings was applicable to the &quot;as applied&quot; constitutional claims. However, the cause of action based on N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 296(1)(a) was governed by the three-year statute of limitations and, thus, was not time barred.</SPAN></P>

The state filed an application to have defendant committed to a secure facility under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20(14). The Supreme Court in New York County (New York) granted the application of the state.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with assault of a policeman. Later that year defendant was voluntarily committed to a psychiatric facility. Defendant pleaded not responsible to the charge of assault by reason of mental disease or defect. The trial court approved the plea and held a hearing to ascertain defendant's mental condition. The trial court decided that defendant was not suffering from a dangerous mental disorder and that he was not mentally ill. Defendant was discharged, subject to an order of conditions under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20(7). Defendant was subsequently involuntarily committed to a secure facility under the New York Criminal Procedure Law. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the New York Mental Hygiene Law and not the New York Criminal Procedure Law applied to defendant because he had been found not to have a dangerous mental disorder and not mentally ill; and (2) when defendant was acquitted and held to be non-dangerous, defendant was subject to civil commitment under the New York Mental Hygiene Law and not commitment to a secure facility under the criminal law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An appeal from a determination granting an application brought by a District Attorney under CPL 330.20 (14) seeking to &quot;recommit&quot; to a secure mental facility a defendant who pleaded &quot;not responsible&quot; by reason of mental disease or defect to an assault charge is not moot notwithstanding the fact that the order to &quot;recommit&quot; defendant has expired and he is no longer in a secure facility, since defendant is prejudiced by the possible continued application of the Criminal Procedure Law to him; pursuant to the interpretation of the CPL urged by the People, he faces a possible 10-year period </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, CPL 330.20 [1] [o]) during which the District Attorney can again proceed to have him committed to a secure facility &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as having a dangerous mental disorder. Moreover, if the People were required to move pursuant to the provisions of the Mental Hygiene Law, such a proceeding would be subject to the higher burden of the &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot; standard, rather than the &quot;preponderance&quot; standard applicable under the CPL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Mental Health -- Patient in Custody of Commissioner of Mental Health -- Proceeding to &quot;Recommit&quot; Defendant -- Applicability of Mental Hygiene Law Rather than Criminal Procedure Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding brought by the District Attorney under CPL 330.20 (14) to &quot;recommit&quot; to a secure mental facility a defendant who pleaded &quot;not responsible&quot; by reason of mental disease or defect to an assault charge, the Mental Hygiene Law, rather than the Criminal Procedure Law, should have been utilized to determine whether or not to commit defendant to a psychiatric facility since the recommitment procedures set out in CPL 330.20 (14) do not apply to a person such as defendant who was adjudged not to have a dangerous mental disorder, nor to be mentally ill, but was discharged subject to an order of conditions at the culmination of an initial hearing under CPL 330.20 (7); the District Attorney &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had no statutory authority to bring a proceeding to have defendant &quot;recommitted&quot; to a secure facility when defendant had never been committed to such a facility upon the initial hearing. There is no ambiguity in CPL 330.20 and since the Legislature specifically directed that the Mental Hygiene Law would apply to all subsequent proceedings for defendants found mentally ill but not dangerous, that law must logically also apply to all defendants, like the instant defendant, found neither mentally ill nor dangerous; furthermore, &quot;recommitment&quot; orders apply solely to defendants initially committed to a secure facility and concern continued custody of defendants after the expiration of initial and subsequent commitment periods, and when application is made for a transfer order </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, CPL 330.20 [8], [9], [11]).  Dangerousness is the necessary predicate upon which the State may base disparate treatment for insanity acquittees, and once there was a judicial determination that defendant was no longer suffering from a dangerous mental disorder, there can be no discrimination in treating him vis-a-vis a person committed in a civil proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner contended that the physical circumstances in the area where it owned land had changed so much that the municipality's zoning code, which restricted development to one acre residential tracts, was no longer reasonable.

On appeal, the court modified the judgment to state that the zoning ordinance was constitutional and affirmed the judgment as modified. The court held that the wisdom of the current zoning code was outside the scope of judicial review. Further, the court held that the landowner had not offered sufficient proof to establish an unconstitutional taking because it had not furnished evidence as to the fair market value of the property in question at the time of its acquisition and had also failed to demonstrate the current value of the property. Accordingly, the landowner had no viable Fifth Amendment &quot;taking&quot; claim. Because the landowner had not prevailed it was not entitled to attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1988 and the court had no need to consider that issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action to declare unconstitutional as applied a local zoning ordinance, plaintiff landowner has failed &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to make out a viable claim pursuant to the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution where there was a lack of evidence as to the fair market value of the property in question at the time of its acquisition, which is not necessarily the same as the amount of plaintiff's investment in the land, and a lack of evidence as to the current value of the property, since although the government's regulation of land use may constitute a taking if it renders the property incapable of yielding a reasonable economic return, mere conclusory testimony as to the effect that the land cannot yield such a return, or that the land would be more valuable under a less restrictive classification, is insufficient; proof of market value is necessary to demonstrate that the land cannot yield an economically reasonable return as zoned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

Although certain areas in close proximity to the subject property recently have been allowed to be developed for industrial purposes so that the wisdom of the challenged residential zoning may be debatable, the trend to industrialization is neither so pronounced nor pervasive as to render the challenged ordinance arbitrary or irrational as a matter of constitutional law.  Moreover, the classification has a rational basis and promotes the public interest since it tends to encourage low-density housing development, a form of land use clearly beneficial to the surrounding community, and there is no persuasive evidence that the land cannot be developed in accordance with the prevailing zoning so as to yield &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a reasonable return.</SPAN></P>

The provisions of Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-bb, which provide for the immunity, defense and indemnification of the trustees and officers of the Long Island Power Authority from personal or civil liability resulting from their carrying out the Authority's purposes, do not violate NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 8 (1), which proscribes the giving or lending of the credit of the State in aid of a public corporation, since there is no indication, beyond mere speculation, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of any borrowing to satisfy indemnity payments and the statute creates no State debt and requires no borrowing by the State; on the contrary, the Legislature appropriates a specific amount of tax-raised revenues, to be paid from the State's general fund, for payments of indemnity and defense costs.  Moreover, given that unconditional indemnification payments without provision for repayment to the State have been held to be constitutionally valid, it necessarily follows that the State can validly advance such payments and be reimbursed for them, as is provided in the legislation creating the Authority; therefore, there is no impermissible extension of State credit as envisioned by the State constitutional provision in question, and plaintiff taxpayers have failed to meet their heavy burden of rebutting the presumption of constitutionality of section 1020-bb.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. V, &sect; 6 and N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 50(1) that appointments be made upon merit and fitness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department conducted a civil service examination to fill vacancies in the two state offices. The raw scores were converted into zone scores and the Department allowed the two state offices to choose candidates from the second zone to take the oral test. The applicants brought the N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding to challenge the legality of the examination after they were not nominated to take the oral test. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held as follows: 1) the 14-point spread used to place applicants in the second zone substantially blurred the relative merit of the applicants; 2) the state office directors received no specific criteria upon which to base selections for the oral test, which further diluted the purposes behind the merit and fitness requirements of N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6; 3) the department had the duty to fix a clear and reasonable standard by which qualifications of applicants for civil service status may be tested; and 4) the zone scoring changed the relative order of scores in violation of 4 N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A judgment of the Supreme Court finding that the use by the Civil Service Commission of a nomination procedure in conjunction with zone scoring, i.e., a test-grading technique whereby raw score results from civil service examinations are grouped into zones or ranges and job applicants with raw scores coming within the same zone or range are assigned the same score, violated the constitutional and statutory requirements that appointments be made upon merit and fitness (NY Const, art V, &sect; 6; Civil Service Law &sect; 50 [1]), is affirmed where the Commission failed to explain why the particular use of zone scoring in the case at bar, which resulted in a 14-point spread in the second highest zone, by far the largest of the six zones, was needed to serve the ends the Commission sought &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to achieve, viz., to provide a broad choice of candidates for diverse job assignments in the mental health field incapable of accurate measurement by means of a written test, and to facilitate a better match between a specific job and candidate; nor was there any substantiation of the claim that affirmative action purposes were achieved.  Not only was it incumbent on the Commission to make such a showing regarding the necessity for zone scoring, but the nomination procedure whereby candidates within a zone were selected to take an oral test lacked clear and reasonable standards and permitted too much unfettered personal preference to be exercised by the local directors of mental health facilities who were given the power of nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Examinations -- Zone Scoring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Use of zone scoring, i.e., a test-grading technique employed by the Civil Service Commission whereby raw score results from civil service examinations are grouped into zones or ranges and job applicants with raw scores coming within the same zone or range are assigned the same score, affected the relative order of scores in violation of 4 NYCRR 67.1 (c) where one of the zones encompassed scores &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which differed by as much as 14.9 points; moreover, since zone scoring equated the written test scores of many candidates, it effectively made it impossible to rank such candidates on the eligible list in order of final ratings </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 4 NYCRR 3.6).  Utilization of a nomination procedure for the purpose of determining which candidates would proceed on to the oral test did not allow for an impartial tie-breaking procedure as required by 4 NYCRR 3.6 where there was a dearth of objective criteria to govern the nominating, and failure to use an impartial ranking procedure does not comport with 4 NYCRR 3.6.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Commissioner of Health of the State of New York appealed an order of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which granted an application by plaintiffs, a patient, physicians, pharmacists and pharmaceutical companies, for a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of a regulation issued by defendant pursuant to its authority under &sect; 3338(3) of New York's Controlled Substances Act, N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect;&sect; 3300-3397.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a patient, physicians, pharmacists and pharmaceutical companies, sought an injunction pending trial on the merits against the enforcement of a regulation issued by defendant Commissioner of Health of the State of New York pursuant to his authority under &sect; 3338(3) of New York's Controlled Substances Act, N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect;&sect; 3300-3397, reclassifying benzodiazepines as a Schedule II drug. The trial court granted the injunction and sua sponte converted the action into a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78. The court restored the matter to a declaratory judgment action, but otherwise affirmed the order granting the injunction. The court found that plaintiffs established a likelihood of success on the merits because their claims, that defendant adopted the disputed regulation to curb the prescribing practices of physicians and that &sect; 3338(3) was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to defendant, had a prima facie validity; irreparable injury to patients would occur due to intrusions into the doctor-patient relationship; and no harm would result to the commonweal by reason of a delay in implementing the regulation, assuming its validity was upheld.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Special Term properly granted a preliminary injunction temporarily restraining the Commissioner of Health from putting into immediate effect a regulation which would impose certain Schedule II prescription controls on certain frequently prescribed Schedule IV tranquilizing medications officially known as benzodiazepines (e.g., Valium), thereby subjecting the dispensation of such drugs to greater control by the State, since questions as to the legality of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the regulation, as well as the impact of its imposition on millions of State citizens and the practice of medicine, warrant a delay until a final determination is made on the merits; although the Controlled Substances Act (Public Health Law &sect;&sect; 3300-3397) expressly authorized the Commissioner by rule or regulation to require that Schedule III or IV drugs be prescribed only upon official State prescription blanks, one of the effects of reclassification, the assertion that the Commissioner adopted the proposed regulation not to prevent the flow of tranquilizers to the underground market, but rather to curb the prescribing practices of physicians who in good faith are prescribing the drugs in question, has prima facie validity, given that the purported illicit diversion of benzodiazepines by 39 health care professionals over an unstated period of time is woefully scant evidence for putting a vast number of people under drug abuse surveillance and interfering with the physician-patient relationship of many millions more in the future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2. In an action challenging the imposition of certain Schedule II prescription controls on certain frequently prescribed Schedule IV tranquilizers officially known as benzodiazepines (e.g., Valium), plaintiffs have met the requirements for a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Commissioner of Health from immediately implementing a regulation that would effect the stronger controls, since enforcement of the regulation would bring the dispensation of those drugs under greater State scrutiny and bring about an enormous governmental intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship, posing a threat to physicians who in good faith prescribe larger amounts of benzodiazepines than the Commissioner, as a physician, might himself prescribe under similar circumstances; moreover, the equities favor plaintiffs since they seek only to preserve the status quo pending determination of the issues, while the injuries which would occur following immediate implementation would be significant and irremediable in light of the wholesale intrusions into the confidentiality of the doctor-patient relationship attending the generation of a computerized record of every person who suffers from anxiety or depression &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and for whom tranquilizers are prescribed. Fears by patients of a loss of privacy, fears by doctors of enmeshing themselves in administrative &quot;red tape&quot; and of possible investigation for perceived overprescribing, and the burden on the old and poor of increased frequency of doctor visits, given that prescriptions for Schedule II drugs are for shorter periods of time and may not be refilled, are factors favoring continuing the injunctive relief until trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an action challenging the imposition of certain Schedule II prescription controls on certain frequently prescribed Schedule IV tranquilizers officially known as benzodiazepines (e.g., Valium), plaintiffs have raised a question of legislative intent which should be explored as to whether the Legislature actually contemplated that the Commissioner would actually extend the sweep of the regulations governing the prescription and use of the most dangerous drugs to tranquilizers and whether it contemplated that the millions of users, prescribers and dispensers of such &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  drugs would be enrolled upon a State roster, where at least a prima facie showing has been made that the Commissioner promulgated the reclassifying regulation not because of purely health considerations within his province, but because of social and economic (if not also political) considerations which are solely within the Legislature's province; although the Commissioner's delegated powers are very broad, plaintiffs have made enough of a showing to establish a likelihood of success in their contention that the Commissioner acted in excess of his powers to justify a preliminary injunction restraining the implementation of the regulation, where the issues involved are of such serious import that the regulation should not become effective without exploration of them and their ramifications.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant New York State Department of Taxation and Finance (department) challenged the order from the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which found for plaintiff air forwarders and transporters in ruling that N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y.

Air forwarders and transporters (forwarders) paid the N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 184(1) franchise tax under protest. After the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance (department) refused a refund, the forwarders brought an action to declare &sect; 184(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The trial court declared &sect; 184(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court affirmed and held that the department sought to impose on the allocable New York shares of the forwarders' gross receipts for interstate transportation, upon receipts at least a portion of which were for air transportation of packages and freight for the forwarders' customers. The court concluded that the 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1513(a) exemption as to such taxation clearly applied, irrespective of whether the forwarders either did not directly furnish the air transportation or that they incidentally also furnished non-air transportation as part of the offered services for which they received gross receipts.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, petitioner abandoned the argument that he was not a compact parolee and argued that &sect; 259-o(4) was inapplicable because it was limited only to compact parolees who were afforded a preliminary hearing. The court rejected this claim and affirmed the lower court's judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Commissioner of Education (commissioner) appealed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Albany County (New York), which granted partial summary judgment to plaintiffs, teaching professionals and organizations, and found that N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 8, &sect; 175.35(e)(1)(i) was unconstitutional. Plaintiffs appealed the summary judgment for the commissioner that held that he was authorized to adopt the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After additional funds were apportioned under the excellence in teaching (EIT) program, the commissioner promulgated N.Y.

Plaintiffs filed an action against the commissioner. The trial court determined that although the commissioner was authorized to promulgate &sect; 175.35(e)(1)(i), the regulation violated the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Both parties appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the commissioner was not compelled by statute to extend eligibility under the EIT to all professional supervisory staff members. After applying the less stringent rational basis standard of review to the regulation, the court found that administrative convenience was not a valid basis for infringing on the constitutional rights of excluded educational personnel because the commissioner failed to demonstrate that he made a considered evaluation of the benefits and burdens involved. The appropriate remedy was to declare &sect; 175.35(e)(1)(i) invalid in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that granted partial summary judgment to plaintiffs and found that the regulation that excluded part-time educational professionals from the EIT was unconstitutional.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While defendant Commissioner of Education was not compelled by statute to extend eligibility for excellence in teaching apportionment (EIT) (Education Law &sect; 1950 [15]; &sect; 3602 [27]), a program designed to supplement the salaries of teachers employed by local school districts and boards of cooperative educational services (BOCES), to all professional supervisory staff members of each school district and BOCES, Supreme Court correctly held invalid on equal protection grounds that portion of the regulations (8 NYCRR 175.35 [e] [1] [i]) which extends eligibility to educators who are not full-time classroom teachers, excluding &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  only those who are not members of teachers' bargaining units.

Accordingly, 8 NYCRR 175.35 (e) (1) (i) is declared invalid; however, because of the demonstrated hardship and fiscal confusion which would result from retroactive application of a declaration of invalidity, the judgment is prospective only.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff firefighter suffered a permanently disabling job-related injury in 1969 and continued to receive his full wages under General Municipal Law &sect; 207-a until 1985, when he began to receive the new duty disability retirement benefit pursuant to Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 363-c, which provided him with a pension of one half of his final average salary, in addition to compensation pursuant to General Municipal Law &sect; 207-a reflecting the difference between his pension and the amount of his regular salary. General Municipal Law &sect; 207-a and Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 363-c do not violate NY Constitution, article V, &sect; 7, the Nonimpairment Clause; plaintiff's calculation that under Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 375-i he would have received a pension of the maximum 75% &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of his final average salary had he remained employed until age 70 is premised upon his expectation of remaining in public employment, an expectation which is not within the scope of protection afforded by the Nonimpairment Clause.  At the time plaintiff was retired under Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 363-c, he could have opted for his benefits under Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 375-i as they had accrued to that point in time; the Nonimpairment Clause does not mandate that plaintiff be kept on the public payroll until he has accrued the maximum potential benefits.  Further, Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 363-c was intended to be applicable to injuries sustained before January 1, 1985 or the statute's effective date of August 1, 1984; the express language of the statute rebuts the general presumption that statutes are to be construed prospectively. Finally, plaintiff's contention that the distinction between persons under and over the age of 60 made by Retirement and Social Security Law former &sect; 363-c (b) (1) violates equal protection has been rendered moot by an amendment eliminating that requirement.  </SPAN></P>

The investigation revealed that defendants had engaged in a long-term fraudulent scheme to bill Medicaid for patient visits that never occurred, and none of the factual allegations were controverted by any party having personal knowledge; although based in part on hearsay, the affidavit contained detailed factual information and was neither vague nor conclusory.</SPAN></P>

The order is not an invalid attempt by the State to compel testimony without granting immunity or to penalize the exercise of the privilege since a party's invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination in a civil case, which is what a forfeiture proceeding is in New York, may be considered by the finder of facts, and there is no automatic forfeiture of defendants' property resulting from their failure to disclose information inasmuch as the provisional remedies imposed result in a &quot;freezing&quot; of defendants' assets via attachment and not a forfeiture; accordingly, the disclosure order directed in conjunction with the provisional remedy phase of the forfeiture action does not violate the Fifth Amendment. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the trial court order that declared N.Y.  Admin.

The city council enacted Local Law No. 66 to help defray the costs of state's administration of the New York City Rent Stabilization Law and made the $ 10 fee imposed upon the owners retroactive to fiscal year 1984/1985. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order, granted defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment, and declared that the Local Law No. 66 was constitutional. The court held that the retroactive fee imposition under the Local Law No. 66 was constitutional because it was not in conflict with the enabling statute, N.Y. Unconsol. Law &sect; 8628. The court found that although framed in prospective terms, the 1983 amendments to &sect; 8628 took effect on April 1, 1984, and thus permitted the city to collect fees from that date at a rate of $ 10 per unit per year. Further, since Local Law No. 66 levied the $ 10 fee for only one fiscal year, it did not violate the annual ceiling provided in N.Y. Unconsol. Laws &sect; 8628(c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state traditionally enforced a policy requiring employees of local governments, including firefighters, to reside within or near the political unit in which they serve. City fire commissioner and state enforced the residency requirement more strictly against firefighters living outside the state than against those living inside the state, and in particular, notified firefighters that if their spouse and family lived outside the designated areas, even if firefighter maintained a separate residence within the designated area, they would be fired.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service -- Firefighters -- Residency Requirement -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The State, in enforcing its traditional policy of requiring certain employees of local governments to reside within or near the political unit in which they serve, may draw a distinction between those public employees who have violated local residency requirements by living outside the State, and those public employees who have violated such laws by residing in unsanctioned locations within the State, and although the imposition of more stringent measures&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of enforcement upon the former class of public servants may be perceived as a form of discrimination against a group of persons based solely upon State residence, that discrimination is founded upon a valid exercise of the State's authority to require its own employees, or the employees of any of its political subdivisions, to reside within the State.  Accordingly, New York City firefighters may be required to reside within the State (see, Public Officers Law &sect; 3 [19]; &sect; 30 [5-a]) since there is no fundamental right to government employment for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause and the State need only show a rational basis for establishing such requirement; given that State residents are more likely to pay property taxes in New York, spend their money in New York, and pay resident income taxes, the State's economic self-interest is a legitimate interest which serves as a rational basis justifying the distinction between State residency and out-of-State residency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service -- Firefighters -- Privileges and Immunities -- In-State Residency Requirement for Public Employees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

In litigation challenging a residency requirement for firefighters, who sought a declaration that a firefighter may be a lawful inhabitant and domiciliary of a permitted county irrespective of the domicile or residency of his family and irrespective of the fact that he may have more than one residence, in order to warrant the granting of such declaratory relief, it must appear that the municipal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  authorities have taken the position that a firefighter may not be in compliance with the requirement unless he resides with his family or unless he maintains only one residence, and since the authorities have not taken such a position no actual controversy exists and the court is, hence, precluded from issuing a declaratory judgment. </SPAN></P>

Defendant's contention that the court improperly denied his request to submit to the jury the charge of consensual sodomy as a lesser included offense of sodomy in the first degree was without merit. The consensual sodomy statute had been declared unconstitutional prior to trial; thus, consensual sodomy was no longer a crime at the time of trial.

Following a hearing, the state trooper was found guilty of 19 charges and dismissal from employment was recommended. The superintendent adopted these findings and the recommended penalty, and issued an order of dismissal. The state trooper argued that the evidence did not support his dismissal. The court disagreed and confirmed the superintendent's determination and dismissed the state trooper's petition for review. The testimony of many witnesses, together with the state trooper's own admissions provided substantial evidence to support each of the charges upon which he was found guilty. The court found that the state trooper neither sought to compel the testimony of the unavailable witness by court order nor raised constitutional objections at that time. Furthermore, the regulations upon which the charges were based were not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The superintendent was vested with broad discretion to establish rules and regulations to govern discipline and control the state police force.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff buyer brought an action against defendant seller seeking the return of a repossessed vehicle. The Supreme Court of Cattaraugus County (New York) held that the repossession rights afforded to a secured party upon default under N.Y. U.C.C. &sect;&sect; 9-503, 9-504 were in violation of the buyer's constitutional right to due process. The seller appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer and seller entered into an agreement for the lease and purchase of a truck. Six months later, the seller repossessed the vehicle without the knowledge or permission of the buyer. This repossession was done without breach of the peace and without judicial process. The buyer acknowledged that he owed taxes on the truck but contended that the seller had no right to repossess the vehicle based on that nonpayment. The buyer claimed that N.Y. U.C.C. &sect; 9-503, which authorized a secured party to retake possession of collateral without prior notice and hearing, was unconstitutional. The seller asserted that he had the right to repossess this vehicle because of the buyer's breach of the lease agreement. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 9-503 was constitutional because peaceable self-help remedies by secured creditors did not involve &quot;state action&quot; but rather constituted private action not governed by the Fourteenth Amendment. In order for the trial court to have ordered the truck's return to the buyer, it had to first determine that it was probable that the buyer would have succeeded on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court unanimously reversed the judgment for the buyer in his action for the return of a repossessed vehicle and remitted the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Supreme Court, Bronx County (New York) entered upon a jury verdict convicting him of two counts of sodomy in the second-degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.45, claiming that the court erroneously denied his motion for a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of two counts of sodomy in the second-degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.45 was reversed on appeal where the court found that prejudicial information relating to defendant's homosexual life-style, associations, and prior crimes was admitted into evidence on the mistaken ground that it proved defendant's intent to commit the acts. The court found that the evidence was actually used for the improper purpose of demonstrating defendant's propensity to commit the crimes charged, noting that intent was not an issue in the case because defendant denied any physical contact with the alleged victims and never offered an innocent explanation of those acts. The court also pointed out that the prosecutor was allowed to cross-examine a defense witness about a wide range of prejudicial matters that were only remotely and tangentially related to direct testimony. Finally, the prosecutor's closing argument was held to be an incitement to convict, invoking extralegal norms that transcended the evidence and the law. The court balanced the gravity and pervasiveness of the errors against the weight of admissible evidence and found that defendant was denied a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case remanded for a new trial where prejudicial information concerning defendant's life-style and associations, including evidence of other crimes, was admitted into evidence to demonstrate a propensity to commit the crimes charged, and the prosecution's closing argument incited to convict on grounds that transcended evidence and law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Proof of Other Crimes -- Sodomy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a sodomy prosecution in which the 37-year-old defendant was convicted of engaging in oral sex with two boys under the age of 14, it was reversible error to have permitted the introduction of evidence that defendant was affiliated with the newsletter of the North American Man-Boy Love Association, an organization that advocates sexual activity between adults and boys, as proof of defendant's &quot;intent&quot; to commit sodomy, and that defendant had been previously known to the police as a pedophile, since the true purpose behind the introduction of that evidence was to expose defendant's sexual preferences in order to demonstrate a propensity to commit the crimes charged, which was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a clear violation of well-settled legal principles.  In the trial of sex offenses, extrinsic evidence of intent is admissible only where there is no challenge to the occurrence of the physical contact and intent of the actor is at issue because the nature of the contact is subject to varying interpretations.  In the instant case, the acts charged are not equivocal and defendant has consistently denied any sexual contact; thus, defendant's intent was never at issue.  Moreover, by eliciting that defendant was a &quot;known pedophile&quot; to police, the prosecutor indirectly flouted the court's repeated ruling excluding defendant's police record for similar conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sodomy -- Disclosure of Defendant's Legal Challenge to Penal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a sodomy prosecution in which the 37-year-old defendant was accused of engaging in oral sex with two boys under the age of 14, neither law nor logic permitted the disclosure of defendant's Federal court legal challenge to the law under which he was being prosecuted where a prosecution witness, who recanted his allegation in court, asserted on cross-examination that the police had harassed him into originally accusing defendant, and that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that harassment was the predicate for a Federal damage suit, and where the constitutional challenge was a separate cause of action to which the witness was not a party, since merely by introducing a new issue, a party does not run the risk that any evidence relating to it, no matter how remote or tangential, will be brought out.  The prosecutor used the witness' resort to the courts as a pretext to reveal defendant's effort to legalize sexual conduct with youths; that testimony had no impeachment value as to the witness and its only purpose was to demonstrate defendant's sexual tendencies.  Moreover, it was improper to have asked the witness if his coplaintiffs in the Federal action were &quot;other boys who refused to testify in the Grand Jury&quot;, and to have revealed the existence of salacious pictures taken from defendant's apartment; nor did the jury, after the prosecutor broadcasted the title in its presence, need to view a pornographic videotape to know what was portrayed in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Argument and Conduct of Counsel -- Invocation of Divine Authority in Prosecutor's Summation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a sodomy prosecution in which the 37-year-old defendant was accused of engaging in oral&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sex with two boys under the age of 14, the prosecutor's invocation of Divine Authority, coupled with an appeal to &quot;the citizens of this county&quot; to thwart the corruption of their youth by the North American Man-Boy Love Association, an organization advocating sex between adults and boys with which defendant was affiliated, took the summation beyond the pale of routine oratorical excess and was an incitement to convict on grounds that transcend the evidence and the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Corroboration as to Sex Offenses -- Date of Occurrence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a sodomy prosecution in which the 37-year-old defendant was accused of engaging in oral sex with two boys under the age of 14, the date of one incident should have been presented to the jury as a question of fact where the complainant demonstrated an inability to fix that date with any precision (e.g., placing Thanksgiving in February), since that incident related to a time when corroboration was no longer required to establish the legal sufficiency of complainant's testimony.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers appealed a decision by respondent New York State Tax Commission (commission), which sustained the New York Department of Taxation and Finance's (department) determination, which issued notices of determination and demand for payment of sales and use tax on admission charges and food and beverages sold for periods running from mid-1977 through late-1981.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers' business presented live entertainment. The taxpayers did not collect sales and use tax on the sales of admission tickets, nor did they keep adequate records on food and beverage sales. The department determined that the admission charges were taxable under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1105(f)(3) and demanded payment of sales and use tax for periods running from mid-1977 through late-1981. The commission sustained the department's determination. The court modified the determination of the department by annulling it to the extent that it assessed sales and use tax on the taxpayers' admission charges collected prior to March 1, 1981. The court confirmed the determination to the extent that it assessed sales and use tax on the taxpayers' admission charges collected on and after March 1, 1981 and to the extent that it assessed food and beverages sold. The court found that there was doubt as to whether the taxpayers' activities made it a cabaret, and thus subject to tax under &sect; 1105(f)(3). The court held that that uncertainty precluded the department from assessing the tax on the taxpayers' admission charges prior to March 1, 1981, the date &sect; 1105(f)(3) was made retroactive to.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding to review a determination of the State Tax Commission which imposed sales and use taxes on the admission charges to petitioners' business establishment, which presented live music, comedians, dancers and plays in a converted bowling alley where patrons could also purchase food and drink, since there is a legitimate doubt as to whether petitioners' activities come within Tax Law &sect; 1105 (f) (3), the &quot;cabaret tax&quot;, the statute must be construed in petitioners' favor; thus, the lack of certainty as to the applicability of the &quot;cabaret tax&quot; precludes the Commission from assessing the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tax on petitioners' admission charges prior to the adoption of an amendment clarifying the statute to clearly require such tax.  The need for the clarifying amendment, which was supported by the Commission, is a clear admission of ambiguity in the scope of the &quot;cabaret tax&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Sales and Use Taxes -- Retroactive Application</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding to review the determination of the State Tax Commission imposing the &quot;cabaret tax&quot; (Tax Law &sect; 1105 [f] [3]) on petitioners' establishment, petitioners failed to show that the Legislature acted arbitrarily in amending Tax Law &sect; 1101 (d) (12), which defines &quot;cabaret&quot;, to provide for a retroactive application of the tax; the amendment reflected a sound and lawful legislative purpose, i.e., to clarify the scope of and expand the tax, and it was made retroactive presumably because the Legislature assumed that enterprises like petitioners' were already within the scope of the law prior to its amendment.  A retroactive tax does not violate due process unless its operation is harsh and oppressive, and given petitioners' failure to show arbitrariness on the part of the Legislature, the Commission is entitled to assess the tax&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the period covered by the amendment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of a controlling 1974 Federal court order concerning forfeiture proceedings involving property held by the Property Clerk of the New York City Police Department, the applicable time period for instituting a forfeiture proceeding pursuant to Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 14-140, which deals with property representing the proceeds of criminal activity or serving as the instrumentality of criminal conduct, is 10 &quot;working&quot; days after a demand for the return of the property has been made, and &quot;working&quot; days must be construed as excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays; General Construction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Law &sect; 20, which generally provides that all calendar days are to be included in computing time periods, is inapplicable since that statute is a guideline for statutory and contractual interpretation and has no application to a judicial order which specifically provides otherwise.  Moreover, the 10-day period begins on the date the demand is received, not the date of its mailing, since the goal of according the police property clerk the broadest 10-day period possible would be frustrated by a date of mailing rule, given the uncertainty of mail delivery.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was acquitted of a charge of arson but the jury was unable to agree as to a lesser included offense.

The prisoner filed an action to recover damages for wrongful conviction. The trial court granted the state's motion to dismiss the action. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. First, the prisoner failed to prove that his conviction was reversed on one of the grounds stated in &sect; 8(b). The double jeopardy claim related to the court's jurisdiction. However, it was also a constitutional violation and &sect; 8(b) excluded dismissals that were based on constitutional violations. The court held that because reversals based on double jeopardy grounds did not have anything to do with the prisoner's innocence, a &sect; 8(b) recovery could not be premised on double jeopardy grounds. Second, the prisoner failed to show the likelihood of success at trial in proving his innocence.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Unjust Conviction and Imprisonment Act</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a claim against the State based on claimant's alleged unjust imprisonment, claimant's apparent reliance on Court of Claims Act &sect; 8-b (3) (b) (ii) (D) is misplaced since that statute requires that the law under which a claimant was prosecuted be unconstitutional, yet nowhere is it asserted that the arson statutes under which claimant was indicted and convicted (Penal Law &sect;&sect; 150.05, 150.10) are unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a claim against the State based on claimant's alleged unjust imprisonment, claimant failed to factually demonstrate a likelihood of success at trial in proving his innocence, an essential component of his cause of action, since Court of Claims Act &sect; 8-b, pursuant to which claimant's cause of action is maintained, mandates a showing of innocence and the presumption of innocence does not apply since the Legislature, in civil proceedings under section 8-b, specifically imposed the burden on claimant to prove his innocence by clear and convincing evidence, and claimant has merely presented a rehash of the trial evidence which led to his conviction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A necessary element of a claim against the State for unjust imprisonment is the establishment of injury as a result of imprisonment; mere damage to reputation does not suffice.  Therefore, inasmuch as claimant remained imprisoned on other criminal charges after the arson charges against him were dismissed on double jeopardy grounds, he is not entitled to redress under Court of Claims Act &sect; 8-b, which, because it creates a new cause of action, must be strictly construed. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant purchasers sought review of a decision of Supreme Court, Franklin County (New York), which found in favor of plaintiff sellers in plaintiffs' breach of contract action seeking damages and specific performance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sellers had bought a dairy farm from a third party but decided to sell the property when they were unable to afford the monthly payments. Defendant purchasers agreed to purchase the property under a combination lease and purchase agreement. The parties were then informed of a prior contract vendee's claim to the property, which resulted in defendants being unable to obtain the requisite financing for its proposed operation of the farm. Consequently, defendants stopped all payments of rents and taxes on the farm, contending that a cloud on the title excused its performance. In plaintiffs' action for damages and specific performance for breach of contract, the trial court found in plaintiffs' favor. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that defendants could not rely on plaintiffs' failure to record the contract and pay a recording fee to claim its unenforceability where defendants had introduced the contract into evidence, and defendants were not justified in repudiating the contract or claiming anticipatory breach of contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court for plaintiff sellers for damages and specific performance because defendant purchasers clearly breached their lease and purchase agreement with plaintiffs by their failure to pay a monthly contract amount.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Mortgage Recording Tax -- Land Contract</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action for money damages and specific performance of a contract to purchase land, the contract is an instrument constituting a mortgage within the meaning of Tax Law &sect; 250 since it is an executory contract for the sale of real property under which the vendee has or is entitled to possession; therefore, the contract could have been recorded as a mortgage upon payment of the requisite recording tax had the vendee sought the protection of the recording act. However, the contract was not recorded and the failure to record was not raised until after the close of evidence and both sides had rested; thus, defendant's argument that plaintiffs' failure to comply with the provisions of Tax Law &sect; 258, which provides that no mortgage shall be received in evidence unless the recording tax has been paid, renders the contract unenforceable is without merit since the tax imposed by the statute is a recording tax and not a tax&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the mortgage, and payment of the tax is referable not to the mere existence of the mortgage but to a mortgage which has been recorded. Furthermore, upon repudiation and breach of the contract by defendants, there was no &quot;executory&quot; contract of sale in existence and, consequently, the instrument introduced into evidence is without the proscription set forth in the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Contracts -- Breach or Performance of Contract -- Anticipatory Breach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action for money damages and specific performance of a contract to purchase land, the vendee's anticipatory breach of contract was without legal justification, where the vendee suspended its performance contending that the actions of prior contract vendees, now in bankruptcy, clouded the title, since the prior contract vendees' action against plaintiffs had been dismissed by Law Day and the dismissal of their contempt proceeding against plaintiffs' grantor had also been affirmed by that date; the contempt proceeding, in any event, would not affect plaintiffs' title since a prior judgment in Bankruptcy Court, holding that the prior contract vendees had no equitable interest in the property on the day they filed their bankruptcy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  petition, was res judicata as to the marketability of title until reversed on appeal.  Moreover, even if the prior contract vendees had a further appeal pending on Law Day, a right to appeal is not sufficient to relieve a purchaser of the obligation to accept title.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order from the Supreme Court in Tompkins County (New York) that convicted him of manslaughter in the first degree upon entry of a guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's young stepdaughter was severely beaten, he was indicted for second degree murder under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.25(2). The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, and defendant entered a guilty plea to first degree manslaughter. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding first that defendant's guilty plea to manslaughter did not constitute a waiver of his challenge to the &quot;depraved indifference&quot; murder section of the New York Penal Law because his objection went to the jurisdiction of the trial court to hold criminal proceedings against him and was therefore nonwaivable. However, the court concluded that the definition of depraved mind murder in &sect; 125.25(2) was a more than sufficiently definite standard in providing an objective assessment of the degree of risk presented by defendant's reckless conduct. Thus, the statute provided both fair notice and meaningful guidelines for law enforcement officials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order that convicted defendant of first degree manslaughter and concluded that New York's depraved mind murder statute was not so vague and indefinite as to violate due process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Plea of Guilty -- &quot;Depraved Indifference&quot; Murder</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's guilty plea to manslaughter did not constitute a waiver of his constitutional challenge to the validity of the &quot;depraved indifference&quot; murder provision of Penal Law &sect; 125.25 (2) where defendant preserved his objection by duly and timely raising the issue before the trial court.  Defendant's challenge to the validity of the original accusation in the indictment was a jurisdictional one and a guilty plea to the crime for which he was indicted would not have precluded his attack on the constitutionality of section 125.25 (2).  Since the objection goes to the jurisdiction of the court and was, thus, nonwaivable, defendant may maintain his challenge on his plea to the reduced charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Murder -- &quot;Depraved Indifference&quot; Murder -- Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a criminal prosecution involving the fatal beating of defendant's two-year-old stepdaughter, defendant's contention&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the phrase &quot;[under] circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life&quot;, which elevates a reckless homicide from manslaughter to murder, is so vague and indefinite as to violate constitutional due process protections, is without merit since depraved mind murder has been a part of State law for over 150 years and its meaning is well settled. The more important aspect of the &quot;void for vagueness&quot; doctrine is not the provision of actual notice of prohibited conduct but the mandatory inclusion of minimal guidelines for law enforcement agencies; the doctrine recognizes that some forms of conduct which a State may validly make subject to penal sanctions cannot, and need not, be defined with precision.  There is no doubt that the conduct defendant was accused of committing falls well within the statute's known boundaries; therefore, defendant lacks standing to challenge the vagueness of the statute as it might be hypothetically applied to the conduct of others.  </SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's referral decision and held that: (1) a judicial hearing officer had the authority and power to hear equitable distribution matters but not without the parties' consent unless the referral was limited to making non-binding findings of fact; (2) fundamental differences existed between an &quot;examination of a long account,&quot; which was an accounting for goods sold, work performed, or money advances that was traditionally limited to matters concerning basic mathematical calculations, and an equitable distribution, which required an exercise of judgment and discretion regarding many issues; (3) there was no statutory authority for such a compulsory referral; and (4) the judicial hearing officer's decision satisfied the statutory requirement of a referee's report and was deemed as a referral to hear and report.</SPAN></P>

Fundamental differences exist between the type of issues to be resolved in an equitable distribution matter and those traditionally involved in &quot;[examinations] of a long account&quot;, since unlike a mercantile account, the distributive award to which a spouse is entitled cannot be determined by reference to a contractual or mathematical formula, but requires the exercise of the court's discretion; moreover, the issue of spousal maintenance involves a number of intangible factors and is qualitatively different from questions concerning a &quot;long account&quot;.  The fact that the parties herein are not entitled to a jury trial does not warrant a different result since they do have a right to have a Supreme Court Justice resolve their dispute; in addition, no specific statutory authority exists to permit compulsory reference of equitable distribution matters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff elected state court judges filed a complaint in the Supreme Court, Kings County (New York), that sought, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that N.Y.

Law &sect; 23 violated plaintiffs' due process and equal protection rights under the U.S. Constitution, and an injunction barring defendants, certain New York officials and boards, from requiring plaintiffs' mandatory retirement by reason of age.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff elected state court judges commenced an action seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 25(b) and N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 23 were violative of plaintiffs' due process and equal protection rights under the U.S. Constitution, and a permanent injunction enjoining defendants, certain New York officials and boards, from causing plaintiffs' involuntary retirement by reason of age. Defendants filed cross-motions to dismiss the complaint and for a declaration that the challenged provisions were constitutional. The trial court held that the challenged provisions had no rational basis and were violative of plaintiffs' constitutional rights. The trial court granted plaintiffs' request for declaratory relief and denied defendants' cross-motion. The court reversed. The court concluded that New York's involuntary retirement rules were fully consistent with constitutional principles of equal protection. The court held that New York need not set aside its mandatory retirement rule solely because, under the purported command of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, a small percentage of such judges (18 percent) had been exempted from that rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the holding of the lower court and found the involuntary retirement statutes did not discriminate on the basis of age. The court decided the classification of state and local officers into elective and nonelective categories was founded upon a reasonable basis as the distinction was not between appointed and elected judges; it was a distinction between elected state officers generally, as opposed to nonelected state officers.</SPAN></P>

The court further found no abuse of discretion in lower court's refusal to vacate the plea. The court found that a review of the plea allocution confirmed that defendant was thoroughly apprised of the consequence of his plea, that he acknowledged that he had been given a full opportunity to discuss the matter with his attorney, that the plea was of his own free will and that he was pleading guilty to avoid a potential persistent felony offender sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Municipal Housing Authority for the City of Yonkers (Authority) filed for judicial review of an order issued by respondent New York State Emergency Financial Control Board for the City of Yonkers (Board), which directed the Authority to produce certain financial information. The Supreme Court of Westchester County (New York) enjoined the Board from asserting jurisdiction over the Authority. The Board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New York State Financial Emergency Act of 1984 for the City of Yonkers (Act), 1984 N.Y. Laws ch. 103, &sect; 2, was enacted to establish a plan for restoring the city to financial solvency. It empowered the Board to oversee the finances of the city and covered organizations. After the Board determined that the Authority was a covered organization, it ordered it to produce copies of all of its contracts. The lower court found that the Authority was not a covered organization because it did not receive funds from the Board; the federal government funded it. The court modified the lower court's order. The court held that the Authority was a covered organization under the Act notwithstanding that it did not receive funds from the Board. The court found that the construction given to the statutory language by the lower court was contrary to the plain meaning of the words contained therein. The Act stated that the definition of a covered organization in any event included, without limitation, the Board of Education of the City of Yonkers and the Yonkers City Housing Authority. The court noted that the effective July 19, 1985, the Authority ceased to be a covered organization per se.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the lower court's order. The modification mandated that all of the Board's orders that were directed at the Authority prior to July 19, 1985 were valid and enforceable, but all orders issued on and after July 19, 1985 were void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3602 was unconstitutional to the extent that it provided for formulas in the calculation of state aid to school districts predicated upon inaccurate date not subject to verification. The supreme court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment to the extent of declaring that defendants' use of the data-gathering mechanism pursuant to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 20, &sect; 2000.2 was arbitrary and capricious, as applied, to administer the distribution of state aid funds to plaintiffs under &sect; 3602. Further, the supreme court ordered defendants to make the necessary adjustments of disbursements paid to plaintiffs for the school years 1980-1981 through 1984-1985 by use of the procedures afforded under 1984 N.Y. Laws 889. On appeal, the court reversed. The court did not find that the district income data was grossly inaccurate as alleged by plaintiffs. The selected verification program instituted pursuant to 889 found significant income overstatement in less than 3 percent of the school district and the amount of income so overstated was slightly over 1 percent of the total income reported on all long-form tax returns for the year of 1983.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed because &sect; 6-136(2)(b) provided for a geographically based disparity of treatment of candidates for the same office in counties of substantially equivalent population, which violated the &quot;one-person-one-vote&quot; equal protection standards. The legislature had determined that in counties outside the City of New York, even though the population of any such county might have been equal to or greater than a county within the city, fewer signatures were required.

While zone scoring may be appropriate in certain cases where the need therefor has been shown (e.g., affirmative action), no such showing has been made; nor is authority for zone scoring to be found in regulations providing for the &quot;statistical adjustment&quot; of test scores ( 4 NYCRR 67.1 [b], [c]), since any such adjustment must preserve the &quot;relative order of scores&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed an officer who responded to information that there was a domestic disturbance at defendant's home. Defendant executed a written waiver of jury trial. The trial court disapproved defendant's waiver, but failed to state upon the record its reasons for such disapproval. The court reversed defendant's conviction. The court held that under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, defendant had a constitutional right to waive trial by jury in all criminal cases, except those in which the crime charged could be punishable by death. Defendant could not have been subjected to the death penalty on conviction of any of the crimes that he was charged with. Under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 320.10, the trial court had to approve the execution and submission of a jury trial waiver unless it determined that it was tendered as a stratagem to procure an otherwise impermissible procedural advantage or that defendant was not fully aware of the consequences of his choice. The trial court's discretion to reject a waiver was carefully circumscribed and had to be explained on the record. The trial court failed to state its reasons.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a murder prosecution in which defendant interposed an insanity defense and during jury selection executed in the presence of the Trial Judge a written waiver of jury trial, which was thereafter submitted in open court, it was reversible error for the court to have disapproved the waiver without stating on the record its reasons for such disapproval, since defendant had an absolute right to a trial without a jury.  CPL 320.10 (2) circumscribes the court's discretion in rejecting waivers of the right to a jury trial, requiring the court to state on the record its reasons for disapproving the waiver; if there was justification for the court's refusal to permit defendant to be tried by a Judge without a jury, it is not apparent in the record, and absent any statement by the court as to the basis for its action, it must be concluded that defendant was denied a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  right guaranteed to him under the State Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fair Trial -- Court's Failure to Question Jury after Prolonged Delay of Trial -- Mistrial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a homicide prosecution arising out of the shooting of a police officer, the court's failure to question the jury as to the potential for prejudice occasioned by the delay of the trial for approximately 100 days worked to deny defendant a fair trial where the District Attorney joined in the defense motion to voir dire the jury, since it was essential to an intelligent resolution of defendant's mistrial motion that a voir dire be conducted.  Although the decision whether to declare a mistrial rests in the sound discretion of the trial court, the question of whether the jury remained capable of rendering a fair and objective verdict according to the evidence is unanswerable on this record because, in the absence of any inquiry by the court, it is impossible to determine that the jurors were not prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

Employees joining the system between July 1 and December 31, 1976, were temporarily eligible for Tier II benefits until Tier III became operative. Appellees joined the Retirement System in late December 1976 and were temporarily placed in Tier II until they were made members of the Tier III plan the following January. The court found that employees commencing public employment and joining the Retirement System between July 1 and December 31, 1976, were not entitled to permanent Tier II coverage because all of the contractual terms providing for temporary coverage under Tier II until January 1977 were on the books on the date appellees joined the Retirement System. The court found that the change in status was not the result of a subsequent legislative enactment and that there had been no attempt to diminish their benefits after the expiration of the statute that was in effect when they entered the Retirement System.</SPAN></P>

On July 27, 1976, Laws of 1976 (ch 890) as enacted, providing that the new Tier III retirement program was made applicable to public employees joining the Retirement System on or after July 1, 1976 but that Tier III would not be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  operative until January 1, 1977.

All of these contractual terms had been enacted into law on the date these individuals joined the Retirement System, and there was no attempt to diminish the benefits of members after the expiration of a statute which was in effect when they entered the Retirement System. Laws of 1976 (ch 890) did not violate the rights of persons entering the Retirement System between July 27, 1976 and December 31, 1976 under NY Constitution, article V, &sect; 7, which established membership in a public retirement system as a contractual relationship and provided that the Legislature could not diminish or impair the terms of the contract once it was entered into.  </SPAN></P>

Accordingly, defendant, convicted of robbery in the first degree in 1983, was properly resentenced as a first offender since a 1972 conviction for assault in the second degree which was unconstitutionally obtained could not serve as a predicate felony, nor could a 1968 conviction for grand larceny in the third degree; defendant was sentenced on the 1968 conviction more than 10 years prior to the commission of the felony for which he was being sentenced, and the 10-year statutory period was not tolled by the period during which defendant had been incarcerated on the 1972 conviction.

The matter arose when the victim was injured at a racetrack. The supreme court denied the corporations' motion for summary judgment as well as a motion to dismiss the complaint. Further, the court granted a motion by the victim to strike an affirmative defense by the corporations. Upon review, the court held that the victim had paid a fee for the use of a place of amusement. As such, the facility, an automobile racetrack, was an establishment within the contemplation of the N.Y. Gen. Oblig.

The corporation asserted that the statute did not apply to the facility because it involved an inherently dangerous activity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs judges filed a complaint seeking to have N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 221-d, which established a discriminatory salary schedule for judges, declared unconstitutional because it resulted in disparate financial treatment depriving plaintiffs of their rights to equal protection. Upon losing at summary judgment, the plaintiffs appealed arguing that they were entitled to parity with their counterparts. Salaries were previously determined and financed by the particular locality in which they served, thus reflecting differing fiscal philosophies and limitations. The court found that the disparate financial treatment perpetuated by the legislation challenged at bar deprived the plaintiffs of their rights to equal protection under the N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and the U.S. Const. amend XIV, &sect; 1, and, accordingly, reversed the judgment, vacated the salary order, and granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judiciary Law &sect; 221-d, which established the operative salary schedule pursuant to which County Court Judges were compensated between the years 1979 and 1984, is an unconstitutional denial of equal protection insofar as it provided for a salary disparity between the Judges of the County Court in Nassau and Suffolk Counties since there exists no rational basis for the salary classifications created by the statute.  A comparison of the statute's discriminatory salary schedule and the materials submitted in support of the geographical distinctions fails to establish that the classifications drawn rest upon grounds rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate State interest where the data clearly demonstrate that the functions, duties and responsibilities of County Court Judges serving in the two counties are identical, that for all practical purposes their case loads are the same, that there is no meaningful difference in county-wide population, and that there are absent significant economic distinctions between the two contiguous counties upon which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to rationally ground the salary disparity. </SPAN></P>

The assessment did not violate equal protection; the legislative history and valid State objective in funding BDCC losses afford a rational basis for the distinctions in the assessment of hospital revenues to which plaintiff's objection is addressed.  The statute does not run afoul of the Supremacy Clause (US Const, art VI, cl 2) as a discriminatory tax against the United States or those with whom it does business nor does it discriminate against persons with whom the United States does business in its Medicare program.  Finally, the assessment is rationally related to the legitimate State objective&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of encouraging and enabling hospitals to serve the State's medically indigent population and thus, does not offend the Due Process Clause.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Nassau County Court (New York), which denied his motion to suppress evidence of a prior misdemeanor conviction of driving while intoxicated in violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1192(2). Defendant was charged a second time under that section and, because the prior conviction enhanced the subsequent charge, the trial court had convicted him, upon his plea of guilty, of driving while intoxicated as a felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because defendant had previously been convicted of a misdemeanor for driving while intoxicated under N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1192(5), a second conviction would constitute a felony. To avoid a felony conviction, defendant moved to suppress evidence of his first conviction on the grounds that his guilty plea was constitutionally invalid. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that, in N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect; 400.20, 400.21, the legislature had provided a mechanism to challenge predicate felonies which might lead to enhanced sentences but that no similar mechanism had been provided for predicate misdemeanors. The court held, however, that due process did not require the courts to fashion such a remedy. The court also emphasized that defendant had a full panoply of remedies available to challenge his conviction on the misdemeanor charge, including the right to attack the constitutionality of his prior plea. The court held, however, that defendant was not denied due process simply because his arsenal did not include the additional remedy of a motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Driving while Intoxicated as Felony -- Motion to Suppress Evidence of Prior Misdemeanor Conviction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no authority to permit a court to suppress, on motion, evidence of a prior misdemeanor conviction for driving while intoxicated where that prior conviction enhances a subsequent charge to felony status.  Where defendant chooses to plead guilty to the new offense, the People are absolved from having to prove any of the elements of the offense, including the element of the prior conviction, which defendant asserts suffered from an invalid allocution and ineffective assistance of counsel. Although the Legislature has provided a procedural mechanism by which to challenge predicate felonies which may lead to enhanced sentences, it has not seen fit to enact similar legislation in cases where a defendant is prosecuted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for a felony because the degree of criminal conduct is enhanced by virtue of a prior misdemeanor conviction, even though the result may be a greater sentence. Having been given a full range of opportunities to attack the propriety of his prior conviction, including withdrawal of his plea, direct appeal, and motion to vacate the judgment, and having exercised some of them, defendant is not denied due process simply because his arsenal does not include the additional remedy of a motion to suppress, and there is no justification for fashioning a new remedy in that form.  </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed both orders of the supreme court. The court found that although the executive director was not a public officer and no constitutional infirmity existed, the contractual provision for a minimum five-year tenure in office was void as against public policy because such provision could bind the board's successors with respect to the executive director's employment. The court found that because the first order only invalidated the term of the executive director's employment, the second order granting the severance and termination benefits was not inconsistent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an Albany County family court judge, appealed a judgment of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which granted summary judgment for defendants, the Comptroller and State of New York, and declared that N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 221-e did not unconstitutionally deprive Albany County family court judges of equal protection because they were paid less than county judges earned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Albany County family court judge asserted that there was no rational basis for salary disparity between a family court judge and a county judge in Albany County. The trial court declared that the statutory salary scheme was constitutionally valid. On appeal, the court found the two courts differed drastically in subject matter jurisdiction, procedures, and functions. Thus, judges of the two courts were not members of the same class for purposes of equal protection analysis. The Albany County family judge further argued that of all of the other counties state-wide where different persons held the positions of family court judge and county judge equated their salaries within the same county, except Albany County and one other county. The court held that family court judges in such counties were not a discrete class and there was no evidence of invidious discrimination against the Albany County judge. The Albany County judge's salary was the same as that of the judges in 18 of those other counties. The court concluded that the Equal Protection Clause was not offended and the classification was not wholly arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

Also, the court found that although N.Y. C.P.L. 220.10 (5)(e) prohibited a defendant from entering a plea of guilty to murder in the first degree under N.Y.

Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 363-c was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment dismissing the petitions. The court held that the employers were not required to provide the difference between the duty disability retirement benefit and full compensation because benefits under the General Municipal Law were not contractual rights protected by the United States Constitution, and benefits provided under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect;207-c were part of the terms and conditions of employment that the Legislature could alter without infringing on the right guaranteed by N.Y. Const. art.

Following the enactment of Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 363-c, which added a new performance duty disability retirement benefit providing a benefit of approximately one-half pay to police officers such as petitioners who had become disabled while on the job but who had not qualified for accidental disability retirement benefits, and the amendment of General Municipal Law &sect; 207-c to provide that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  employers would be permitted to terminate salary payments to an employee who was granted duty disability retirement benefits, petitioners' employers successfully submitted applications on behalf of petitioners for duty disability retirement benefits and the employers were permitted to terminate their General Municipal Law &sect; 207-c full salary payments.  Benefits under the General Municipal Law are not contractual rights protected by the US Constitution, but are part of the terms and conditions of employment which can be altered by the Legislature without infringing on the right guaranteed by the NY Constitution (art V, &sect; 7) not to diminish pension or retirement benefits; accordingly, the decision not to require municipalities to provide the difference between the duty disability retirement benefit and full compensation was not in violation of the NY or US Constitutions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Clinton County Court (New York) entered upon a verdict convicting him of murder in the second degree and sentencing him to an indeterminate term of nine years to life imprisonment. Defendant was 13 years old but tried as an adult pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 210.43, for the stabbing death of a neighbor child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction, claiming the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Defendant had asked if the child could accompany him while he exercised his dogs and the child was later found dead from 33 stab wounds. Defendant's family members saw defendant return to the house with blood soaked clothing, and a knife found near the scene had defendant's father's initials on it. On appeal, the court found that the evidence that his clothing was &quot;drenched&quot; with blood and other evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was sufficient to permit a jury to infer defendant's guilt. The court noted, however, that it did not believe that the jury's inference of defendant's consciousness of guilt from the prosecution's failure to produce his clothing was correct because there was no showing that defendant participated in the loss or destruction of his clothing. The court also assigned error to the introduction of hearsay testimony. Despite these errors, the court found that reversal of defendant's conviction was not mandated since the errors were considered harmless. The evidence established defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment convicting defendant of second-degree murder because the evidence did not warrant a reversal of the conviction and defendant was not deprived of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Murder -- Circumstantial Evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a circumstantial evidence case, the inference which may be drawn from the proven facts must exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis except guilt; if that burden is met, however, a verdict is supportable even though the defense posits a version of the facts consistent with defendant's innocence, and the guilty verdict thus rendered indicates that the jury accepted the prosecution's competing version of the facts, requiring the evidence to be viewed on appeal in a light most favorable to the prosecution.  Accordingly, the evidence in the instant case was legally sufficient to support defendant's conviction of murder of a 10-year-old boy where there was evidence that defendant was the last person to be seen with the victim alive, that defendant had blood on his clothing when seen after returning from a walk in the woods with the victim, that the victim's death was caused by stabbing, that a knife to which defendant had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  access was found less than 50 feet from the body, that the knife in question was capable of producing the wounds in the victim's body, that fibers from the victim's shirt were found on the knife, and that defendant's explanation regarding the victim's absence was contradicted by the victim's mother and sister who denied having called the boy home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Murder -- Reasonable Doubt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a homicide prosecution, defendant's explanation of the presence of blood on his clothes shortly after being seen with the stabbing victim did not raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt as a matter of law where defendant contended that the blood came from a cut on his thumb which he received when he fell on broken glass in a hole in the woods and stated that the hole contained no water, but the State Police said the hole contained approximately one foot of water and no broken glass, since the jury could have reasonably rejected defendant's story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Evidence -- Defendant's Blood-Stained Clothing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a homicide prosecution in which it was conceded that defendant and the stabbing victim were seen walking into the woods and that defendant returned with blood on his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  clothing, it was not error to have permitted the prosecution to introduce the fact that the defendant's clothing had disappeared while in the exclusive possession of defendant and his family, since the failure to produce the clothing or to account for its nonproduction would have allowed the jury to draw a negative inference against the prosecution as a result of the missing evidence, and it would be unfair to permit such an inference when the clothing was at all times in the exclusive control of defendant or his family, and could not be found even when the family's premises were searched pursuant to a warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Harmless and Prejudicial Error -- Hearsay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a homicide prosecution, although it was error to have given a charge permitting the jury to draw an inference of defendant's consciousness of guilt from the failure to produce defendant's blood-stained clothing, since there was no proof of defendant's knowledge, authorization or participation in the loss or destruction of the clothing, and although it was also error to have permitted the hearsay testimony of a witness who contradicted the testimony of defendant's parents, since the witness's statements were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an impermissible attempt by the prosecution to impeach its own witnesses, being neither contradictory statements signed by defendant's parents nor contradictory oral statements made by them under oath </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, CPL 60.35), reversal of defendant's murder conviction is not mandated since the errors were harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. Moreover, although hearsay testimony of a State Trooper was also improperly admitted, the court specifically limited all the hearsay to the issue of credibility, and, therefore, the testimony was not so prejudicial as to constitute reversible error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Instructions -- Waiver</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a homicide prosecution, where the court gave a charge that was intended to convey to the jury the general principles requested by defendant but contained a few obviously incorrect words, defendant was required to alert the court to the error to afford an opportunity to correct it, and defendant's failure to do so resulted in a waiver of the objection; accordingly, a question of law was not preserved for appellate review, and the court does not find the error such that reversal is required in the interest of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Disclosure -- Failure to Disclose Exculpatory Material</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In a homicide prosecution, the failure to preserve the stomach contents of the victim more than 30 days after the police report was not the destruction of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> material where defendant was unable to establish when the victim had last eaten or what he had to eat; lacking appropriate foundation, the destruction of the evidence cannot be considered the destruction of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Brady</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> material.  Moreover, the fact that a spot of blood on the victim's shoe was neither the type of the victim nor defendant, but was that of the victim's mother, was not so critical as to create a reasonable doubt of defendant's guilt, as a matter of law, and the apparent rejection of its significance by the jury is accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Trial -- Trial of Juvenile in Family or County Court</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  CPL 210.43 (1) (b) is not an unconstitutional vesting of unreviewable power in the District Attorney to decide whether a particular case should be tried in Family Court or in County Court, since the statute does not create a right to have a particular case removed to Family Court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested following a police inspection of the junkyard pursuant to N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf.

Defendant owner was arrested following the inspection and defendant employee two days later. However, defendant employee was arrested for actions he took on the date of inspection. Both defendants argued that the trial court erred by denying their motions to suppress evidence. The court reversed defendants' convictions. Subsequent to the convictions, a decision of the New York Court of Appeals had declared N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 415-a(5) and New York City, N.Y. Charter &sect; 436 to be unconstitutional. The court held that defendant owner's conviction was required to be reversed in light of that decision. The court held that it did not need to reach the issue of defendant employee's standing to challenge the propriety of the search upon constitutional grounds since the statute and administrative code provision underlying his arrest and conviction were declared unconstitutional and he did have the requisite standing in that regard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, city, mayor, and zoning officials (city), challenged the order of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), denying their motion to dismiss two causes of action brought by plaintiff residents seeking to maintain a class action constitutional challenge to zoning amendments.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the authority of the city, a planning commission studied rezoning of a section of the city. It recommended the creation of a special district for low-income groups (district) and the rehabilitation of older housing accommodations, and it proposed regulations to accomplish these goals. The regulations were adopted, and the residents filed suit challenging the zoning amendments that created the district. On the city's motion to dismiss, the lower court dismissed only one of the residents' claims. The city appealed. Although the residents' action was time barred under N.Y.C.P.L.R. 217, the court ruled on the merits. The court reversed the denial of the city's motion to dismiss the residents' remaining claims. The court held that the city adopted the zoning amendments under a well-considered plan. The plan was comprehensive, and the district included the needs of both low-income and middle income residents of the area. The plan was properly adopted. The residents were seeking a change in the legislation, and the court would not substitute its judgment for that of the legislature in a zoning matter.</SPAN></P>

The trial court declared that the village had the power to enact and enforce its zoning ordinances and that ch. 506 was valid and constitutional. The owner appealed, and the court concluded that the owner did not present sufficient proof to rebut the strong presumption of constitutionality of the statute beyond a reasonable doubt. The court concluded that ch. 506 was enacted long after the village was incorporated and did not concern or affect its existing charter.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord appealed a summary judgment entered by the Supreme Court, New York County, New York, in favor of defendant tenant in the landlord's action for first, a declaratory judgment that the tenant's right to occupy an apartment expired on the death of the tenant of record, and second, a judgment ejecting the tenant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A landlord brought an action for a declaratory judgment that a tenant's right to occupy an apartment expired upon the death of his roommate, the tenant of record. The landlord's summary judgment motion was granted. The tenant then filed a motion for renewal of his summary judgment motion, asserting that a subsequent state agency emergency bulletin entitled him to a rent-stabilized renewal lease. The lower court recalled its prior decision and awarded the tenant the lease. On appeal, the court reversed. Administrative agencies could only promulgate rules to further the implementation of the law as it existed. The bulletin's &quot;rules&quot; were designed to extend the protection of the New York City Rent Stabilization Law to parties the legislature never intended to protect. Because the emergency bulletin was inoperative, the rule applied that no family member not named on a rent-stabilized lease was entitled to a renewal lease after the named tenant vacated the apartment. The tenant and similarly situated &quot;gay life partners&quot; could not claim that they were being denied equal protection of the law when the law failed to protect any family members who were not named in the lease as tenants.</SPAN></P>

The emergency bulletin cannot be deemed an effective amendment to the Rent Stabilization Code since the required procedures were not followed; moreover, the emergency bulletin was not promulgated in accordance with the procedures for rule making set forth in the State Administrative Procedure Act.  </SPAN></P>

In view of the Appellate Division's determination that plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of action for declaratory relief since the case is not justiciable, the merits of plaintiffs' constitutional claims will not be addressed, and the Supreme Court, having once determined that plaintiffs have not presented the necessary requirements for a declaratory judgment action, should have similarly declined to have reached the merits.  </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the lower court's decision for the taxpayer, which had reversed the commission's decision, because &quot;taxable income&quot; in I.R.C. &sect; 63 was presumptively to be applied to compute &quot;entire net income&quot; under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 208(9). Because I.R.C. &sect; 852(b)(2) was used to calculate the federal taxable income and federal law controlled what was &quot;entire net income,&quot; the commission's &quot;net income&quot; figure was to be the same as the federal amount. Thus, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 20, &sect; 3.11 improperly defined federal &quot;taxable income.&quot; The legislative silence and the regulation's years of existence did not imply that the legislature sanctioned the commission's interpretation. The legislative amendments only clarified N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 208(9)(b)(1). Thus, the taxpayer was entitled to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders in the computation of its entire net income.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supreme Court properly declared 20 NYCRR former 3.11 invalid as contrary to Tax Law &sect; 208 (9) in that regulated investment companies were entitled to deduct dividends paid to their shareholders in computing their entire net income for taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1980.  Respondent State Tax Commission erred in applying the definition of &quot;taxable income&quot; contained in Internal Revenue Code &sect; 63 (26 USC); Tax Law &sect; 208 (9) provides that the figure to be used for computing &quot;entire net income&quot; shall be presumably the same as the &quot;taxable income&quot; that the taxpayer is required to report to the Federal Government, and since the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Federal Government would arrive at petitioner investment company's taxable income by way of Internal Revenue Code &sect; 852 (b) (2) and Federal law controls for the purpose of defining &quot;entire net income&quot; and is authorized by statute (Tax Law &sect; 208 [9]), respondent's regulation is incorrect. The addition of Tax Law &sect; 209 (7) in 1979 should not be perceived as a sanction of the agency's administrative interpretation. The franchise tax is not an income tax and thus, Tax Law &sect; 208 (9) is not unconstitutional because enacted at a time when the Legislature was constitutionally prohibited from fixing taxes by references to any other law.  Dividends were intended to be included in investment company net income. Petitioner's &quot;taxable income&quot; was properly determined in the first instance, since the deduction for dividends paid under Internal Revenue Code &sect; 852 (b) (2) (D) is to be shown as an &quot;other deduction&quot; on the line of the appropriate form, which is deductible in arriving at &quot;taxable income&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, town and officials, filed suit against defendants, state and county, seeking a judgment declaring N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1210-A and Suffolk County, N.Y. Res. 823 (1984) unconstitutional. Subsequently, the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (New York) entered an order denying plaintiffs' cross-motion for a preliminary injunction and summary judgment, dismissing the complaint in part and denying summary judgment motions by the state and county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their action, plaintiffs argued &sect; 1210-A and Res. 823 impermissibly imposed a general, countywide tax for the benefit of a special district; constituted a denial of equal protection of the law; were impermissibly vague and uncertain; and were unlawfully enacted. In addressing the parties' various motions, the court dismissed the complaint insofar as it was asserted by the municipal plaintiffs due to their lack of standing, but refused to grant summary judgment to either party because it was not convinced there were no defenses to the causes of action, and the state and county's applications for summary judgment were nothing more than an afterthought. Plaintiffs appealed, and the county and state cross appealed. The court held summary judgment was appropriate, in addition to the dismissal ordered by the trial court, because N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1210-A did not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of the state's taxing power. In addition, the court held plaintiffs did not meet their burden of establishing the imposition of the additional sales and compensating-use tax was palpably arbitrary or amounted to invidious discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The legislative pronouncement that the financial difficulties of said sewer district and of other sewer districts are a countywide concern and that the stabilization of assessments and the continued operation of those districts would benefit the county as a whole is not palpably unjust, and there is thus no unconstitutional delegation of the State's taxing power. The burden of establishing that the imposition of this additional sales and compensating use tax upon only Suffolk County is palpably arbitrary or amounts to invidious discrimination has not been met; there is a rational basis for treating the residents of Suffolk County differently from the residents of Nassau County for the purposes of this statute.  Any incidental benefit which may accrue to the owners of real property located in the subject sewer district does not invalidate the enactments.  Furthermore, pursuant to Tax Law &sect; 1210-A (b), any action taken by the County Executive&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with regard to the determination of the amounts necessary to stabilize assessments in a given sewer district must first be approved by the county legislature and thus the State Legislature has not improperly delegated its power to assess and collect taxes without setting proper guidelines.

At the conclusion of this testimony, the trial court granted the district attorney's motion for a directed verdict, and then reopened the matter, hearing testimony from the owner's probation officer, and arguments on whether a forfeiture would have constituted an unreasonable and excessive penalty for the crime to which the owner pled guilty. Reversing the decision, the court explained that the trial court did not have any statutory authority, pursuant to &sect; 3388, to dismiss the petition and direct the return of the vehicle.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff seller sued defendant county and corporation, seeking repossession of collateral, foreclosure, damages for conversion, and injunctive relief. The Supreme Court of New York at Special Term, Nassau County, denied a motion by the county for summary judgment, denied a motion by the corporation to cancel the notice of pendency filed against the property, and denied a motion by the seller for summary judgment. The parties filed cross-appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved a dispute over the validity of the seller's interest in a prefabricated diner, which was assembled onsite. The overriding issue raised on appeal was whether the diner on the property was to be treated as realty or personalty. The court held that the diner was a trade fixture and thus was personalty, because the diner was annexed to the leased realty by the seller and was intended to be used solely for the seller's business and trade and was built for a particular use. The court held, however, that a triable issue of fact existed as to whether removal would materially injure the property. Further, the court held that the county and the corporation did not acquire title to the diner by purchase of a tax deed at a tax sale. In addition, the court held that the seller's reliance on U.C.C. &sect; 9-313, seeking to recover the diner as a fixture, was misplaced since the diner was a trade fixture and was not within the purport of the statute. The court held that before the seller could pursue its remedies as a secured creditor under U.C.C. art. 9, the trier of the facts must determine whether the diner was &quot;movable&quot; under U.C.C. 9-105(1)(h).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Fixtures -- Trade Fixtures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In plaintiff's action for repossession of a diner it had sold and related relief, brought after its successor defaulted in payments due under the security agreement it had entered into with plaintiff, a motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint by the county which had purchased a tax lien on the property upon which the diner was located was properly denied, as was plaintiff's motion for summary judgment seeking possession&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the diner and foreclosure on its security interest in the diner. When the county took title to the property, plaintiff lost its right to remove the diner without regard to potential material damage to the freehold since the county was not bound by the terms of the lease between the former owner of the subject property and plaintiff, which provided that plaintiff had the right to remove the diner without regard to possible material injury to the freehold; nevertheless, since the diner remained the personalty of plaintiff due to its status as a trade fixture, notwithstanding termination of the lease, plaintiff had a right to remove the diner provided that removal would not materially damage the freehold, and there is a triable issue of fact as to whether removal would materially injure the property.  Plaintiff may not recover the diner as a fixture pursuant to UCC 9-313, since the diner is a trade fixture and is not within the purport of the statute.  Further, plaintiff may have a perfected security interest in the diner and may exercise its rights under the UCC if the trier of facts determines that the diner is &quot;movable&quot; under UCC 9-105 (1) (h).  The facts that a building permit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was obtained to construct the diner, that a certificate of occupancy was issued after completion of the construction, and that the diner was assessed by the county for real estate tax purposes does not mean that the diner constitutes realty. The county could not obtain ownership by foreclosing against the realty and could not, therefore, transfer title to the diner to purchasers of a tax deed from the county.  Furthermore, since plaintiff's UCC-1 financing statement was duly recorded, the county's successor purchased the tax deed with full knowledge of plaintiff's prior lien on the diner. Finally, Special Term properly denied a motion by the current owner of the property, the county's successor, to cancel the notice of pendency filed by plaintiff; although the diner may be personalty and ultimately may be removed by plaintiff, at this stage of the litigation it cannot be stated that this action would not affect the possession, use or enjoyment of the real property ( CPLR 6501).  </SPAN></P>
