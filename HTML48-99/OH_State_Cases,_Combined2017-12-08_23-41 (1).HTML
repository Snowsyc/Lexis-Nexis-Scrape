</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of kidnapping, two counts of aggravated robbery, and a penalty enhancing firearm specification. Defendant sought review and contended that he was denied his right to a speedy trial. The court held that, for purposes of the speedy trial rule, the computation did not include the day on which defendant was arrested under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.14 and Ohio R. Crim. P. 45(A). The court found that because defendant's trial started on his 90th day in jail, the trial court had not erred in denying his motion to dismiss. Under Ohio R. Evid. 614(B), the trial court was permitted to interrogate any witness in an impartial manner, whether called by itself of by a party. The court held that simply because two statutes proscribed the same conduct had not meant that the Double Jeopardy Clause precluded the imposition of cumulative punishments in the same trial. Because the legislature authorized cumulative punishment, the State was allowed to seek it. The court found that the State presented insufficient evidence to support the firearm specification and modified the sentence accordingly. The court affirmed as modified the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an auxiliary service teacher, brought suit against defendants, a local board of education, its superintendent, and its director of instruction, alleging breach of contract, age discrimination, and a deprivation of constitutional rights in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1985. The Common Pleas Court (Ohio) granted summary judgment for defendants, but denied their motion for attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. Both sides appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under a series of non-year limited contracts, the teacher worked for the board in four out of five school years. The board eventually informed the teacher that her contract would not be renewed. In addition to breach of contract and age discrimination, the teacher filed several constitutional claims against defendants. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of defendants. The teacher appealed the dismissal of her case and defendants appealed the denial of their motion for attorney fees. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded in part, holding that summary judgment was proper as to all of the teacher's claims except for the breach of contract claim. Although the teacher was not entitled to a continuing contract on her reemployment, summary judgment was precluded because factual questions existed as to whether the board told her of the reason for its nonrenewal (poor classroom performance) and whether she was allowed to have witnesses testify at a board meeting. However, the board was entitled to attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 with respect to the teacher's meritless constitutional claims that were filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1985(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part summary judgment entered for defendants, holding that certain factual questions remained on the teacher's breach of contract claim even though she had no right to a continuing contract on re-employment. Otherwise, the summary judgment was affirmed. As for defendants' appeal, the court reversed the overruling of the board's motion for attorney fees as to three of the teacher's claims and remanded as to one of her claims.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the parents claimed that the department failed to meet its burden in proving the requirements for the termination of the parents' rights, but the court disagreed. The court held that the trial court's findings on the parents' inability to properly care for the children were in compliance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.414, and its judgment was supported by competent, credible evidence. The court rejected the parents' claim that the statute denied them due process. The court also held that the statute defined the parents' respective rights and sufficiently limited the trial court's discretion. The court also rejected the mentally ill mother's claim that her rights could not be terminated without evidence of a recent overt act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury returned verdicts in favor of the victims in their personal injury action against the city. Almost a year after the verdicts were announced, the victims filed a motion under &sect; 1343.02(C) and sought prejudgment interest on their awards. The trial court denied the motion and held that &sect; 1343.03(C) violated the Ohio and U.S. Constitutions because it violated the city's due process rights and right to a jury trial. The victims sought review. The court found that the trial court failed to find whether the victims were entitled to prejudgment interest under the evidence presented, that the denial of the motion was based solely on the trial court's finding that &sect; 1343.03(C) was unconstitutional, that &sect; 1343.03(C) was not vague, provided sufficient due process, and did not violate the Ohio or the U.S. Constitution. Further, the court found that the victims' motion was not timely filed, that the motion for prejudgment interest should have been made prior to the trial court's entry of the final judgment, and that the appeal of the jury's verdict did not affect the victims' duty to timely seek prejudgment interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated trafficking, in violation of Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2925.03(C)(5), (6) were inconsistent with the general penalty scheme set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.11, and that such provisions were therefore void for vagueness. The trial court subsequently declared unconstitutional the mandatory sentencing provisions of &sect;&sect; 2925.03(C)(5), (6). The court found that the provisions of Ohio Rev.

The court affirmed, concluding that the constable had the authority to arrest defendant outside of the township in which he was appointed pursuant to the &quot;hot pursuit&quot; exception of Ohio Rev.

The court noted that the constable was authorized to stop defendant for the traffic offense, that the constable initiated pursuit immediately after observing the offense, that he initiated pursuit within the township in which he was appointed, and that he observed defendant commit an offense for which points were chargeable under Ohio Rev.

The injured party suffered injuries and brought a tort action against the City, officer, and others. The officer and City each moved for summary judgment, and the trial court granted the motions. The court found that pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 701.02, which the court found constitutional, the officer was immune from liability for negligence because he was engaged in the operation of a motor vehicle while responding to an emergency call at the time of the accident. The court also concluded that the doctrine of sovereign immunity for municipal corporations had been abolished and that the evidence did not negate the allegations of negligence on the part of the City or its agents. The court determined that under the circumstances, the trial court was required to view the City's motion for summary judgment in the same light as a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court held that that the injured party was thus entitled to have all of the material allegations of the complaint considered true.

Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101 after she entered a plea of no contest to a charge of failure to report an accident in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.74.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant left an accident scene and was charged with leaving the scene of an accident. The charge was amended to failing to report an accident and defendant entered a plea of no contest. At trial, it was determined that defendant did not maintain liability insurance at the time of the accident. The court found defendant guilty on the charge of failing to report and also imposed a suspension of her licensee and registration pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101. The driver challenged the suspension and revocation because she asserted that &sect; 4509.101 did not apply to the non-traffic offense of failing to report an accident and the manner of application of the statute denied her due process rights. The court reversed the application of &sect; 4509.101 after affirming the remainder of the decision. Although &sect; 4509.101 applied to the offense of failing to report an accident, it was unconstitutional as applied because it was automatically applied when a person was cited for a traffic violation without regard to the final resolution of the citation, so that the due process requirements of a hearing on the matter before the driving privileges were revoked was not met.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2925.37(B), a felony of the fourth degree. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the indictments. On appeal, the State contended that the trial court erred by granting defendants' motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that it had no facts before it upon which to apply the statutory combination and make its determination of vagueness. The court reversed the order-granting defendants' motion to dismiss and remanded. The court held that the trial court's dismissal of the indictments on the grounds that &sect; 2925.37(B) was unconstitutional and void for vagueness was premature since the facts of each defendant's case were never fully disclosed. An examination of defendants' conduct was required before the statute could be declared unconstitutional.

Code Ann. &sect; 2945.40. After an Ohio trial court denied his request for grounds privileges under &sect; 2945.40(D), he and appellant Ohio Department of Mental Health challenged the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient, who was in a habilitation center, sought to leave the center's grounds in order to take community college classes. The court first held that having the patient go off grounds to attend college was a &quot;release&quot; under &sect; 2945.40 and effected a change in the nature of his court-ordered commitment, thereby requiring judicial approval under the statute. Next, the court held that the evidence supported the trial court's denial of the patient's request. The patient had attempted to stab a friend to death while apparently under the influence of &quot;angel dust,&quot; and there was evidence that he had used marijuana after his confinement and had briefly exhibited psychotic symptoms after using marijuana. The trier of fact could reasonably infer that attending college would allow the patient greater access to illegal drugs and that this would present a threat to public safety. Furthermore, the denial did not violate the patient's due process rights. The court held, however, that under the principle of judicial restraint, the trial court erred in holding &sect; 2945.40 to be unconstitutional. Neither party had raised the issue of the statute's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to death for the murder. On appeal, the court considered the case according to the standards for reviewing capital cases set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.05(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, along with an accomplice who testified for the State, was accused of murdering a 74-year-old vegetable vendor. The court held that defendant had received ineffective assistance of counsel. As part of his trial strategy, defense counsel introduced evidence of defendant's criminal history that would have been barred under Ohio R. Evid. 608 and 609. In addition, defendant referred to the victim as the &quot;old dude&quot; and the &quot;old codger&quot; and said at the mitigation phase that the victim did not have very long to live anyway, a strategy that could only be offensive to the jury as well as highly prejudicial to defendant. Next, counsel failed to object to improper testimony, and his closing argument was rambling and nearly unintelligible. Finally, defense counsel did not question several witnesses about prior convictions, reasons for inconsistencies, and motives of self interest. Noting that it was the finding that defendant was the principal offender in the slaying that subjected him to the death penalty, the court concluded that there was a reasonable probability that the result of the trial might have been different had it not been for the ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

The agent was permitted to purchase beer from a coin-operated vending machine. The agent obtained a research warrant after he left the house. The warrant was executed the next day, and defendant was charged with selling alcohol without a permit, with possession of alcoholic beverages for sale, and with unlawful possession of untaxed alcoholic beverages. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress all evidence seized upon the initial intrusion into the house. On appeal, the court reversed and determined that the agents had a privilege within the meaning of that term as it applied to Ohio Rev.

The officer backed out of the room and defendant followed him and again asked if the officer wanted to have sex with him. The officer produced his police credentials, arrested defendant and charged him with the crime of importuning.

The court further held that because defendant failed to timely file his notice of his alibi defense, the trial court properly excluded evidence concerning the defense. The court also held that no prejudice resulted to defendant from the exclusion of two of his exhibits at trial.

Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(A)(3) with the specification that he purposely compelled the victim, being under 13 years of age, to submit by force or threat of force, and felonious sexual penetration in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.12. The trial court denied his motion for a new trial, and defendant sought review. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71, defendant was to be brought to trial within 270 days after his arrest. The court held that, although defendant was initially arrested for driving without a license, he was arrested later for the other charges. Therefore, the court found that defendant's speedy trial date was not his original arrest but the arrest for the charges for which he was tried. Further, because defendant had a prior felony conviction, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.10, the trial court was required to impose a sentence of actual incarceration of five years. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

After his arrest, police officers obtained entry to defendant's motel room without a warrant and seized a suitcase that contained, among other things, a large quantity of cash. At all times during his criminal proceedings, defendant denied ownership of the money and the other items in the suitcase. The State filed an application for disposal of the cash, and defendant filed a motion for the return of the cash. The trial court denied defendant's motion, holding that he had not proved ownership of the money. Upon review, the court reversed the trial court's judgment, holding that the cash was not lost, abandoned, or lawfully seized as required by &sect; 2933.41(B). The court determined that there was no evidence that the money was stolen or used in any illegal activity, and thus, the cash was not property subject to forfeiture under &sect; 2933.41(B). The court held defendant was not required prove ownership of the cash. The court held that there was no relation between the loss of possession of the money and any legitimate State interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners bought suit seeking to enjoin the corporation from operating a crematory in its funeral home. The homeowners argued that operation of the crematory violated Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 1721.18 because they had not consented to the construction of the crematory. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the homeowners and ordered the corporation to pay damages to the homeowners. On appeal, the court affirmed. The corporation argued that &sect; 1721.18 was not applicable because the corporation was not formed for the erection and maintenance of a crematorium. The court rejected the corporation's argument and held that from the testimony at trial it was clear that cremation was an accepted method of preparing the dead for burial or for funeral. As such, although &quot;crematory&quot; or &quot;crematorium&quot; was not specifically mentioned in the articles of incorporation, the court held that the incidental operation of a crematory was clearly contemplated by the corporation. The court further held that damages were properly awarded because there was ample evidence, especially given the unsettling effect of having a crematorium in one's backyard, to establish the claim on which relief was granted.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the lab's report was admissible under the &quot;business record,&quot; Ohio R. Evid. 803(6), exception to the hearsay rule. Moreover, the court held that Ohio Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant submitted to an intoxilyzer test after he was stopped by a patrolman for an alleged violation of Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3). He was charged with drunk driving when the test results showed an illegal blood alcohol content. The trial court overruled his motion to dismiss based on his contentions that &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was unconstitutionally vague and uncertain. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the statute was not unconstitutional. Specifically, the law expressly defined the prohibited conduct as operating a vehicle if a specific measure of alcohol existed, and the statute specifically stated a prohibited concentration level. The court rejected any claim that the statute was void because it used technical terms or because the average person could not have definitely determined how much he could drink before violating the law. Moreover, the statute contained no presumptions and the State retained the burden of proving the elements beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, the process of negating a defendant's presumption of innocence with proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each element of an offense was consistent with procedural due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents claimed, among other things, that the trial court committed error prejudicial to their rights when it failed to dismiss the allegation charging sexual abuse, when it failed to dismiss the counts charging neglect and the counts charging dependency of all the children, when it allowed the foster parents of the children to intervene as parties prior to the adjudicatory phase of the proceedings below, when it failed to approve the employment of a clinical practitioner to assist counsel for the natural parents, when it allowed the opinion testimony of a child psychologist, when it allowed expert testimony regarding the truthfulness of the children in claiming there had been sexual abuse. The court affirmed the judgment. The record overwhelmingly reflected that the best interest of the children was served by the dispositional order of permanent custody rather than attempted reunification which, likely, under the evidence, would never have been accomplished without potential mental harm to the children.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on count one and guilty on count two. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that because the defense counsel failed to renew his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal after the close of all the evidence, defendant waived any error the trial court may have made in overruling the original motion. The court held further that the testimony of the complainant was sufficient to prove that defendant did not own the property. This was true whether she was the owner, custodian, or simply that she had first-hand knowledge of the true ownership of the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consideration for the Township's agreement to rezone 20 parcels of land from residential to office-residential, the owners agreed to the construction of an access road to reduce traffic. A petition for construction of the road was signed by over 50 percent of the owners pursuant to Ohio Rev. Ann. &sect; 5555.03 and provided that the compensation, damages, and expenses would by assessed against the abutting owners according to the benefits accruing to the property. After the assessments were calculated, the owners brought this action. On appeal, they argued, inter alia, that the trial court's conclusion that the compensation paid to the owners for the taking of their land could be assessed back to them was erroneous. The court found however, that according to the Ohio Supreme Court, the inclusion of the land acquisition costs in the assessment was legal and constitutional. The court also held that the owner's failed to meet their burden of proving that the cost of the road exceeded the amount of the benefit, because the evidence adduced at trial calculated the special benefits from the rezoning and the road at approximately $ 25,000 and the special assessment was only $ 18,125.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When informants told police about possible illegal activity at an auto shop, the police placed the shop under surveillance and observed two stolen vehicles being driven into the shop but never exiting the shop. The police appeared before a magistrate and gave testimony but the officers did not testify under oath and did not submit a written affidavit. When the warrant was served, the police found evidence against defendants, who were charged with receiving stolen property, concealing the identity of a motor vehicle, and possession of criminal tools. Defendants filed a motion to suppress, which the trial court granted. The State sought review. On appeal, the court found that the defects in the issuance of the warrant did not justify the suppression of evidence. Although there was a failure to provide a written affidavit, the court held that the failure was unintentional and was not a violation of constitutional magnitude. The court also held that while the failure to properly administer the oath to the officers seeking the warrant was arguably of constitutional magnitude, the officers acted in objectively reasonable reliance upon the warrant and the motion should have been denied.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the decision of the trial court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after selling marijuana to an undercover police officer, and his automobile was seized. Defendant filed a motion to suppress which related to the seizure. The motion was overruled. The trial court also overruled defendants' motion in limine to prohibit testimony as to his guilty plea to a prior minor misdemeanor possession charge. The trial court granted the State's motion in limine to prohibit any reference to the forfeiture of the automobile. Defendant was convicted as charged. Thereafter, the State filed a motion for forfeiture of the automobile, which the trial court granted. Defendant appealed the trial court's judgment, and the court affirmed. The court held that, assuming arguendo the seizure of the automobile was unconstitutional, defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court overruling his motion to suppress because nothing seized as a result of the seizure of the automobile was offered as evidence by the State. The court held further that the forfeiture provision of &sect; 2925.13 was constitutional because it was rationally related to a legitimate state concern.

No property owner in the area sought to be annexed was against annexation. The witnesses who testified in opposition provided no proof on the general good of the territory sought to be annexed. The opposition witnesses did not want the annexation because of the harmful effect they perceived would result to the area outside the annexation territory. There was insufficient evidence presented to the board upon which it could have properly found that the general good of the territory sought to be annexed would not be served if the annexation petition were granted.

Upon consideration of defendant's arguments, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that: (1) because no U.S. Const. amend. I issues were present, the court would not consider defendant's argument that the statute was overbroad on its face; and (2) because persons of common intelligence were able to ascertain what conduct amounted to a violation, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Because there was no transcript of evidence filed in the appeal, defendant's claim was directed to the overruling by the trial court of the pre-trial motion to dismiss and the charging affidavit.

On appeal, the court held that defendant failed in the trial court to meet the initial burden of submitting any evidentiary documents containing sufficient operative facts to demonstrate the lack of competent counsel and that the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness. The court further found that, with regard to his claim for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, such claim was not cognizable in post-conviction proceedings that strictly dealt with constitutional rights arising at trial.

Defendant failed to present clear and convincing evidence of a then-existing state of facts which made &sect; 2929.71&nbsp;unconstitutional and void as applied to his situation. The statute was not unconstitutional just because defendant's gun was not loaded.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the bail was not excessive. At the time that the trial court set bail, it was aware that in connection with the crimes charged against defendant, two family members had been charged with aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, and attempted murder. Defendant had a criminal record consisting of burglaries, breaking and entering, auto theft, and forgery. The court also held that defendant had failed to identify the perjured testimony of a witness and the court found no evidence of perjury. It was incumbent upon defendant to reference the part of the record that demonstrated error. The court lastly found that there was no evidence that a detective told witnesses that defendant had a prior criminal record with any intent to sway their testimony.

The trial court dismissed the counterclaim and third-party complaint, and found in favor of the law firm on its claim. The client raised numerous points on appeal, including that the trial court erred in precluding him from raising malpractice or ethical violations as a defense. The appeals court noted that a claim of malpractice may be asserted as a defense to an action by an attorney for attorney's fees. However, the record did not reveal any assertion by the client that his asserted counterclaim should be considered an affirmative defense pursuant to Ohio Civ. R. 8(c). Moreover, the client did not offer any expert testimony to prove that the attorney breached the accepted standard of legal representation, while the law firm produced expert testimony that it had not breached the standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Warren Municipal Court of Trumbull County (Ohio), which convicted defendant for disorderly conduct. He argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury and in excluding testimony for a discovery violation, and that the disorderly conduct statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11, was unconstitutionally vague and unconstitutional as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was at the scene of a labor demonstration. Police arrived at the scene in riot gear. Defendant had words with police officers and was arrested for disorderly conduct. Under the statute, recklessness was an element of the offense. Defendant requested an instruction on recklessness. The trial court clearly erred by failing to give any instruction on recklessness. Defendant proffered the testimony of two witnesses whose names he had failed to disclose in response to the prosecution's request for discovery. They heard defendant, immediately before he was arrested, tell the police that residents would not vote for the next police levy because of the conduct of the police. The court held that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony. It was valuable to defendant and had little surprise or shock value. At most the prosecution should have been granted a continuance. The trial court would not rule on the constitutional questions until they were properly presented after correction of the other errors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a traveling companion were picked up while hitchhiking by an undercover agent.

Defendant took the agent to an apartment complex where he said he could get the drugs. Instead he took the agent's money and did not return. Defendant contended that he could not be convicted of the trafficking offense without the specific intent to sell the drugs. The court disagreed. Defendant was charged under the &quot;offer to sell&quot; portion of the statute. The intent to sell the drugs was not an element of the offer to sell. There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of the offense. A cautionary instruction was sufficient to cure an improper question asked by the prosecutor. The trial court was not required to declare a mistrial. The mandatory sentence was authorized by the statute and the statute was within the legislature's discretion.

Code Ann. &sect; 4123.57(B)'s 100 percent limitation on permanent partial disability for workers' compensation claimants was unconstitutional, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Appellee claimant had been denied compensation on the basis of the section.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the claimant was found to have a 22 percent disability due to an injury while working for the city, a district hearing officer held that the claimant could not receive benefits because, with all other previous percentages of permanent partial disability awarded him, he would exceed 100 percent, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.57(B). On review, the trial court held &sect; 4123.57(B)&nbsp;unconstitutional because it created two distinct classes of claimants, one that would be eligible for benefits, and another that was not because they had already received benefits totaling 100 percent or more. The court held that there was a rational basis for such a limitation and that the State had a legitimate interest in maintaining the level of benefits payable to injured workers. The court noted that the workers' compensation fund was a self-supporting system whose actuarial soundness could be undermined by opening it to an unlimited amount of permanent partial disability compensation. All workers were subject to the 100 percent limit and &sect; 4123.57(B) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause; hence, summary judgment to the claimant was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Hamilton County Court of Appeals (Ohio) that convicted him of two counts of rape. Defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2907.02(D) was unconstitutionally applied to him, that he was improperly precluded from presenting testimony concerning the victim's sexual conduct with other males, and that he was improperly precluded from cross-examining the victim regarding her juvenile record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defense to the rape charges, defendant claimed the victim consented to sexual intercourse. The victim testified that she was a lesbian and never had sexual intercourse with men. Defendant sought to introduce evidence of the victim's sexual reputation and her prior acts of intercourse with men. The trial court refused to allow testimony from witnesses other than defendant on the victim's prior sexual activity. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction. As the evidence defendant sought to introduce was not introduced solely to impeach the victim's credibility and went directly to a material issue of the case, the evidence was not inadmissible under Ohio R. Evid. 608(B). Application of the rape shield law, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(D), to defendant was unconstitutional because evidence of the victim's reputation and prior sexual acts were probative of consent. As application of the rape shield law to defendant precluded evidence that was material and probative as to an element of the crime, defendant's right to confront witnesses was violated. The trial court properly refused cross-examination regarding the victim's juvenile record under Ohio R. Evid. 609(D).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The city council had confirmed the city building commissioner's denial of a certificate of business to appellee building owner that sought to resume operation of a tavern business on its premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the trial court reversed the city council's decision, the city filed a motion of finding of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 52, which the trial court overruled because the motion was untimely. The city argued that the trial court was required to issue findings in support of its decision. On appeal, the court found that Ohio Rev. Code. Ann. &sect; 2506.03, which provided the scope of review by the trial court upon the city's appeal, did not require the trial court to issue written factual findings. Nor did the trial court's failure to specify the basis of its reversal constitute noncompliance with the statute because the statute required the trial court to affirm the city council's decision if a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence existed. Ohio R. Civ. P. 52 did not apply because Rule 52 applied when questions of fact were tried by the trial court, and the appeal of the city council zoning decision was not a trial de novo in which the trial court decided questions of fact. However, the trial court failed to remand the case to the commissioner for issuance of the occupancy permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment to remand the case to the commissioner with instructions to issue the building owner a certificate of business, and as modified, the court affirmed the judgment that reversed the city council's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The welfare department filed complaints against appellants, and the trial court granted physical custody of the children to the natural father. The trial court found that the allegations in the department's complaints were proved by clear and convincing evidence. Appellants sought review, and the court held that (1) the removal of the children was in their best interests and that appellants were not deprived due process when they failed to request a continuance to prepare for the hearing; (2) the natural mother's stipulation that the younger child was a dependent under Ohio Rev.

After defendant accompanied the officer to a patrol post, defendant complied with the officer's request for a urine sample. The sample was sent for laboratory processing. The test results disclosed that the urine contained nineteen-one hundredths of blood alcohol. On review, defendant contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to discharge because &sect; 4511.19(A)(4) was unconstitutional, and that the trial court erred by allowing expert testimony from an unqualified witness. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that defendant failed to demonstrate that &sect; 4511.19(A)(4) was unconstitutionally vague. The court also ruled that the admitted expert testimony could have been properly admitted on the basis of the witness's experience or training.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner and his wife, who were both deaf, required an interpreter to assist them in their suit against appellees for damages from the improper construction of a chimney, which separated from their house and had to be torn down and rebuilt at the homeowners' expense. The trial court refused to include their interpreter fees as part of their award of costs pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 54(D) as prevailing parties, because it believed they had wrongfully failed to negotiate with appellees for reconstruction of the chimney. On appeal, the court held that pursuant to R. 54(D) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2311.14 and 2335.06 the homeowner and his wife were entitled to recover their reasonable interpreter fees as part of their costs as the prevailing parties. The court noted that they were not required to negotiate with appellees, who had performed defective work, to reconstruct the chimney. The court also noted that appellee construction company improperly asked for $ 800 to rebuild the chimney and tried to blame the first chimney's defects on high winds. The court remarked that its decision applied the statutes and rule at issue evenly between non-handicapped and handicapped persons.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was clearly and precisely drawn and, thus, was not void for vagueness. The language of &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) conveyed a definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Fairfield Municipal Court (Ohio) in which he was convicted of a violation of the reckless operation ordinance, Fairfield, Ohio, City Ordinance 72.041. He contended the trial court erred in overruling his motion to dismiss on the ground that the penalty set forth in the ordinance amounted to cruel and unusual punishment in that it was disproportionate to that provided by state law for the same offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A first trial was held; on appeal, the court reversed the conviction of reckless operation. Upon remand, the municipal court overruled defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that it placed him in double jeopardy. After the second jury returned the guilty verdict, defendant appealed. The court stated that a municipality could impose a disparate sentence for a crime and not be in conflict with the general law of Ohio, so long as it did not alter the degree of the crime from a misdemeanor to a felony. The ordinance did not change reckless operation from a misdemeanor to a felony; rather, it simply raised a minor misdemeanor to a first degree misdemeanor. Accordingly, the penalty in the ordinance did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment. The court also found no double jeopardy in the prosecution of the reckless driving charge following defendant's acquittal on a driving while under the influence of alcohol charge. Under the ordinance, reckless operation was not an element of a charge for driving under the influence. The evidence required to support the conviction of one offense would not necessarily have been sufficient to sustain a conviction on the other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that an officer saw defendant's vehicle weaving in the road, left of the center line.

The officer allowed him to call his attorney, who arrived over an hour later. The attorney asked to confer privately with defendant. The officer did not object but advised that defendant had to remain in his view to comply with regulations concerning the Intoxilyzer's use. Defendant then refused the test. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the refusal because the record failed to show that he was denied his right to counsel based a lack of privacy. The court ruled that although defendant had a right to consult with counsel before taking the test, that right had to be exercised so as not to unreasonably extend the period between a request to take the test and the moment of refusal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife challenged a decision of the Wood County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) granting summary judgment to appellee husband in a lawsuit seeking recovery of damages for personal injuries, lost wages, and medical expenses from her husband. The injuries occurred in an auto accident involving a vehicle driven by her husband. At the time of the accident, the parties were engaged, but not married.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the accident, but prior to the filing of a complaint, the parties were married. The court first determined as a condition precedent to its review that the interspousal immunity doctrine was properly reviewable by the judiciary and was not a matter requiring legislative enactment. The court found that interspousal immunity had little rational application to premarital negligent acts, and thereby the doctrine violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Ohio and United States Constitutions. In so holding, the court observed that it was time to remove the last vestiges of an unfair and archaic judicial rule as the policy no longer promoted marital harmony, that the proposition was dated as a wife now had the right to sue on contract and property actions, and that it had harmful and collusive effects on individuals who dealt with insurance representatives. The court found insufficient record evidence to support the wife's claim that the husband waived the right to claim interspousal immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city sought to enjoin the owner from keeping and harboring a lion within city limits. The city also alleged that the harboring of the lion, in addition to being contrary to Warren, OH., City Ordinance &sect; 506.01 was, in effect, a nuisance. The trial court concluded that the keeping of the lion was a nuisance. The owner was enjoined from owning, harboring, or keeping the lion, and he appealed. In affirming, the court held that the owner was not entitled to a jury trial because the potential penalty did not exceed $ 100. Further, no criminal penalty was imposed. Accordingly, the constitutional sanction against double jeopardy did not apply. Also, the ordinance did not divest the owner of his lion. It simply prohibited ownership within the corporate limits of the city. Additionally, the passage of the ordinance was not selective legislation; it was not unreasonable to ban lions but not other animals. Finally, the trial court correctly allowed evidence dealing with actual instances wherein the presence of the lion produced a condition of actual discomfort and interfered with the neighbors' enjoyment of their properties.</SPAN></P>

The Board vacated the proposed assessment, and the Chief appealed. The court held that the Chief's proposed assessment was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The court reasoned that the Chief could not retrospectively apply the penalty provisions without increasing the surety's burden under its contract with the permit holder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the taxpayer failed to timely remit motel taxes, the City sought to enforce a penalty under City of West Carrollton, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 739.09(a), (b). In an amended answer and a counterclaim, the taxpayer alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the counterclaim and entered judgment in favor of the City. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by dismissing the counterclaim because the constitutionality issue was otherwise considered and resolved by the trial court. Therefore, the counterclaim was duplicative. The court also found no merit in the taxpayer's contention that the motel tax was hostile, discriminatory, and violative of equal protection. The tax properly was assessed to supplement the City's general needs, and there was no requirement that the tax somehow had to directly benefit the taxpayer. Furthermore, successive penalties could be imposed for each succeeding, independent failure to remit any tax owed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the property owners had political advertising attached to the outside of his front storm door, and the remaining property owners had signs on their front lawns, which advertised the election of a political candidate. After the trial court denied the property owners' motions to dismiss, thus upholding the validity of the ordinance, the property owners pled no contest. The trial court found them guilty, fined each property owner 10 dollars, and placed them on probation. On appeal, the court held that the municipal ordinance was invalid on its face as it impermissibly discriminated against free expression on the basis of content in violation of the First Amendment. Specifically, the fact that the ordinance regulated only political graphics and not other lawn signs rendered it unconstitutional on its face. Moreover, none of the government interests advanced in support of the ordinance were sufficiently compelling to justify the suppression of political speech of individuals through the use of lawn signs on their own property. Thus, the unconstitutionality of the statute met both tests set forth by the United States Supreme Court and the tests of Ohio.</SPAN></P>

Although some of the chemicals were missing, no controlled substance was found, nor was nay part of the production process begun.

The court stated that defendant did not cultivate, manufacture, or otherwise engage in any part of the production of a controlled substance and that merely buying the equipment was not enough to constitute manufacturing.

The agent met defendant's friend at a designated location. The friend accepted payment and told the agent that he would return with the LSD. Neither defendant nor his friend delivered the LSD. Defendant was charged with aggravated trafficking and theft. The trial court denied his motions to dismiss the indictment and for a judgment of acquittal.

Therefore, defendant's failure to deliver the LSD did not exonerate him. The court also found that &sect; 2925.03 was reasonably related to the legislature's desire to eliminate drug trafficking and did not violate the First Amendment in that an offer to sell drugs was not protected speech.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction came about as a result of a large-scale, county-wide drug investigation in which defendant sold a deputy a few hits of LSD. The entire transaction was taped, and the tape was played for the jury. On appeal, the court first found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's Ohio R. Crim. P. 29 motion for acquittal because the evidence against her was not so slight or of so little probative value that reasonable minds could have had reasonable doubt as to her guilt. The court next found that the jury's guilty verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence because defendant admitted the sale to the deputy and knew that she had held money for payment for the LSD. The court had to defer to the jury's conclusion. The court then found that any prejudicial effect of remarks made by the prosecution were eliminated by the trial court's admonishment of the prosecutor and through jury instructions. Finally, the sentence mandated by Ohio Rev.

The state medical board revoked his license, and the trial court affirmed. On further review, the court affirmed. It did not matter that the felonies were not committed in the course of his practice. While Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4731.519 was specific and pertained to podiatrists only, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4731.22 was general and applied to all persons licensed by the board, including podiatrists. There was nothing to indicate that a different standard had been created for licensure or disciplinary action with respect to podiatrists from that standard applicable to physicians. The board did not err in revoking the doctor's license to practice podiatry, even if he was highly technically qualified to practice his profession, because the crimes of aggravated arson and extortion were both serious crimes. Accordingly, for purposes of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4731.22 and 4731.591, there was a conviction of a felony when the court of common pleas entered a judgment upon the verdict and imposed sentence.</SPAN></P>

After a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of resisting arrest. Defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant in overruling his motion to set aside the jury verdict and for acquittal because the verdict was not supported by the manifest weight of the evidence. Additionally, defendant claimed that the verdict was impeached where a finding of not guilty on the assault and obstruction charges required a finding of not guilty on the separate charge of resisting arrest. The court affirmed and ruled that the testimony of the police officers, if believed, was sufficient substantial and credible evidence upon which the jury could have reasonably found defendant was guilty of resisting arrest beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, the jury could consistently find defendant not guilty of doing an act that hampered or impeded the police officers in the performance of their lawful duties but guilty of resisting his arrest for that offense because the charges were based upon different conduct and required different proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered 12 consecutive year and a half sentences for a total of 18 years.

The court also found no breach of Ohio R. Evid. 403(A) in the admission of the State's exhibits because there was no objection to the testimony about nor the qualifying evidence concerning the disputed exhibits. The court also failed to find an abuse of discretion by the trial court's exercise of its power to enter 12 consecutive for a total of 18 years, because although Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.41(E)(3), limits the maximum consecutive sentence to 15 years, the statute did not effect how the sentence was imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owner applied for a zoning certificate, stating that the intended use was an indoor recreation facility. The inspector for the township objected. The trial court issued an injunction disallowing the operation of a massage parlor at the business owner's place of business. The business owner challenged that decision, alleging that the order granting the injunction was too vague. The court held that the injunction was sufficient on its face to make the business owner aware of the prohibited activities. The injunction was clear. The business owner was prohibited from conducting personal services for customers which involved rubbing, touching, and kneading of a customer's skin. The business owner then alleged that the applicable zoning law was void for vagueness. The court held that it was constitutional. Its relevant terms were easily understood regarding what it prohibited without a conditional use permit. Finally, the business owner alleged that it was prejudicial error for the trial court judge to visit the business in question before the trial. The court held that there was no indication that the trial court relied upon information obtained in the view as evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Springfield Municipal Court (Ohio) entered a judgment convicting defendant of driving while intoxicated, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19, and sentencing him to three days in jail. Defendant appealed only the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred by not crediting him with one day of time served in jail between his arrest and release, pending posting of bond. He alleged that the trial court refused to give him credit in stating that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.99 prohibited it. In declining to uphold defendant's sentence, the court first addressed the legislative intent behind Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.99. Although Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.99(A)(1) required a minimum sentence of three days in jail for driving while intoxicated, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.99 did not prohibit giving credit for time served pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2949.08, which required mandatory credit for each day spent in custody prior to conviction. However, the record on appeal did not contain the transcript of the trial court's proceedings. Thus, the court could not discern whether defendant's time in custody was not given due to oversight, whether it was simply not recorded on his conviction record, or whether he received a four-day sentence with one day of credit applied. A remand was necessary for further clarification of defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, reversed the sentence of the trial court, and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff business owner filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Hancock County (Ohio), alleging that defendant fire marshall had ordered the business owner's place of business closed for 24 hours. The complaint sought declaratory relief as to the right to make the order and injunctive relief enjoining the fire marshall's conduct. The business owner appealed the award of summary judgment to the fire marshall.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A temporary restraining order (TRO) was issued, enjoining the fire marshall from imposing any order requiring the vacation or closure of the premises due to any overcrowding which may have been observed. A hearing was held, culminating in the trial court's intention to dissolve the TRO and to deny the preliminary and permanent injunction. The business owner then filed an amended complaint based on the same facts, also seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction. The fire marshall sought summary judgment, as did the business owner. The trial court awarded summary judgment for the fire marshall. The business owner appealed, alleging that the trial court erred: (1) in acting contrary to its finding that the closure order issued was unreasonable and excessive, and therefore unlawful, and (2) in dismissing the business owner's complaint. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in part, and reversed it in part. Any controversy between the parties had been resolved. There was no justiciable controversy on which to found a declaratory judgment. The court reversed upon the separate action for money damages incurred by the business owner arising from the closure of his business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment insofar as there was no justiciable controversy upon which to found a declaratory judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant shot two people who confronted him after he created a disturbance at their homes while looking for someone who owed him money. Although appellant was indicted for attempted murder, the jury found him guilty of aggravated assault, a lesser-included offense. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, but reversed the sentence because the trial court erred in denying appellant's motion to dismiss the specification. It was error to impose the indefinite sentence for aggravated assault under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.11(B)(7) in the absence of a specification in the indictment charging that appellant caused physical harm or threatened physical harm with a deadly weapon, as required in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.11(G) and 2941.143. Because the indefinite sentence was invalid, it could not serve as the necessary predicate for appellant's actual incarceration for his specification conviction. The court also found the verdict form was deficient and held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.71 required a fact-finder to separately address the specification by substantive findings apart form the underlying criminal offense for a conviction on the specification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged following an incident in which police were called to a local bar to investigate a complaint of a patron with a gun concealed in his green army jacket. The bartender pointed defendant out to police. At that time, defendant was sitting on a green army jacket. While one officer spoke with defendant, the other officer searched the jacket, which was within defendant's reach. The searching officer felt a hard object and removed the gun. On appeal, the court held that the search was reasonable, thus the gun was admissible evidence. The trial court did not err in applying Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2951.02(F)(3), which provided that an offender could not receive probation for an offense committed while he was armed with a firearm, because precedent construed that language to include persons convicted of carrying a concealed weapon. Although the statute was amended within 30 days after his sentencing to exclude the offense of carrying a concealed weapon, defendant had not challenged the statute when it was applied to him. The failure to challenge legislation that was presumptively valid did not constitute plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance 627.02 was unconstitutional because it imposed a greater sentence for conviction of carrying a concealed weapon than did the corresponding state statute. The court disagreed holding that the challenged ordinance was not invalid because it provided a penalty different than that imposed by the state. The court also found that &sect; 627.02 was a proper exercise of municipal power to regulate matters affecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens and that the sentence imposed under it bore a reasonable relation to the conduct proscribed. However, the court agreed with defendant's argument that the trial court invaded the province of the jury by instructing them that the knife was a deadly weapon/ordinance as a matter of law. The court concluded that the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the definition of deadly weapon, which was an essential element of the offense. The court concluded that the trial court's failure to provide the statutory definition of a deadly weapon and to submit the nature of the alleged weapon as a factual question to the jury constituted prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer sought review of an order of the Lucas County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), affirming a decision by the state's unemployment compensation review board found that appellee employee was discharged without just cause and therefore, was entitled to unemployment compensation benefits. The employer contended, in part, that the trial court erred because uncontroverted evidence established that the employee had violated a work rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an investigation of missing supplies from the company to which the employee was assigned to work as a security guard, the employee was given a polygraph test. In that test, he admitted that during a prior assignment working for a spark plug company, a supervisor gave him some spark plugs from an allotment provided to the supervisor. The employee was terminated for a violation of a work rule. On appeal, the court first noted that the trial court's review of the administrative agency's decision was governed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506. The trial court was confined to the record of the agency's proceeding. The trial court had to give due deference to the agency's resolution of evidentiary conflicts and could not substitute its judgment for that of the agency. The trial court properly affirmed the Board's determination that the employee was not fired for just cause. The court rejected the employer's new argument that the employee violated a different work rule because that argument was not part of the record at the administrative level. The employer's contention the employee was terminated for mere violation of the work rule--not dishonesty--was unsupported by the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that affirmed the unemployment compensation board's decision that the employee was not terminated for just cause and was, therefore, entitled to unemployment compensation benefits. The court remanded the cause to the trial court for execution of judgment and assessment of costs to the employer.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4729.16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board alleged that the pharmacist tampered with records to forge Demerol prescriptions, falsified dispensing records, dispensed Demerol without a valid written prescription, was addicted to Demerol, and was unfit to practice pharmacy. Upon the pharmacist's stipulation to all allegations except the allegation regarding his addiction and his fitness to function as a pharmacist, the Board suspended the pharmacist from the practice of pharmacy. On appeal, the court affirmed the suspension by finding that the Board's conclusions that the pharmacist had violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4729.16(A) by his gross immorality and had violated &sect; 4729.16(C) by his willful and substantial acts of misconduct and malfeasance were supported by reliable, probative, and substantive evidence. The two statutory violations formed more than an adequate basis to suspend the pharmacist's license. Given evidence that the pharmacist had successfully treated his drug addiction, the board's finding that the pharmacist violated &sect; 4729.16(B) was improper. The term, &quot;gross immorality,&quot; had the requisite degree of certainty to eliminate the Board's arbitrary and erratic application of the standard to pharmacists.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Shaker Heights Municipal Court (Ohio), which found him guilty of a violation of University Heights, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 505.08, which required him to dispose of his dog's feces in a sanitary manner. The trial court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness and did not violate defendant's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant permitted his dog to defecate on a tree lawn inside the city and threw the feces into the street. The trial was held more than 30 days after the charges were filed. On appeal, the court found that the trial was delayed so that the trial court could overrule a demand for a jury trial. The court held that the 30-day period prescribed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71(A) for the trial of misdemeanor charges was tolled under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2945.72(E) for a delay occasioned by defendant. The court further found that there was no evidence in the record to support the equal protection claim, so that the presumption of constitutionality prevailed. The court then held that the ordinance was not vague simply because it did not define the &quot;sanitary manner&quot; mandated for disposal. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional because it alerted a person of ordinary intelligence of the type of conduct prohibited. The court would not consider whether the prosecutor had violated defendant's rights by a failure to make an opening statement because defendant did not provide either a transcript or a statement of proceedings, as required by Ohio R. App. P. 9(C).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not err in taking judicial notice of the fact that construction work was underway on the additions to the company's facility. Judicial notice could be taken at any stage of the action under Ohio R. Evid. 201(F) and was within the discretion of the trial court. The inclusion of the statement in the trial court's opinion did not infer that the construction work was a basis upon which the trial court relied to make its decision and there was no prejudice shown. The trial court also did not err in determining that the BZA decided to deny the company's request for both a conditional use and a variance when the record showed that the two requests were in a single application. The BZA considered both requests and there was ample evidence in the record to support the trial court's finding that the BZA decided both requests. Last, the City Council considered the necessary standards when granting the company's conditional use and variance and the City Council was not required by city ordinance or any other statute to specify certain findings of fact that supported their issuance.

The trial court sustained the secretary of state's motion for dismissal, and the individual perfected his appeal. The individual made four assignments of error. On appeal, the court overruled the individual's assignments of error and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that when a cancelled corporation did not pay its taxes within one year after cancellation it was subject to the loss of its corporate name. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5733.22 provided for the reinstatement of a cancelled corporation. The individual did not have a clear legal right to notice of the loss of his corporation's legal name. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5733.20 granted the secretary of state the authority to cancel the individual's articles of incorporation after the corporation failed to apply for reinstatement. There was no denial of due process. The trial court properly applied the law as enacted rather than invaded the province of the legislature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landfill operator claimed that the city ordinances at issue were unconstitutional because they were preempted by state statutes that regulated the operation of solid waste disposal facilities.

Code Ann. ch. 3745, which established procedures regarding the licensing and administration of solid waste disposal facilities, including those dealing with complaint, hearing and appeal, suspension, revocation, and prosecution or injunction of violations or threatened violations of the laws and regulations pertaining to the prevention, control, and abatement of air and water pollution, was a general statute with a statewide comprehensive plan that preempted the legislative field.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the city enacted an emergency measure to construct flood protection facilities in the district, it notified the landowners of the estimated assessments. The landowners and members of their class owned 1,300 parcels in the district. The complaint alleged that the estimated assessments were not determined according to the benefit method, but were determined by dividing the total amount to be assessed by the area of all lands to be assessed. They further alleged that such method resulted in assessments that were arbitrary and bore no relationship to the specific benefit conferred on each piece of land. The landowners further alleged that the city's board of revision of assessments did not comply with due process as required under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 727.16. The court held that the record disclosed that the landowners were afforded proper notice and a fair opportunity to be heard before the final assessment cost figures were determined and that Toledo, Ohio, City Charter art.

The trial court denied the extradition request and issued writs of habeas corpus to appellees, but on appeal, the court determined that the trial court's order was erroneous.

Code Ann. &sect; 2929.71 for having on his person or in his control a firearm while committing felonious assault, to be served consecutive with an indefinite term of imprisonment of 3-15 years for felonious assault, in violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not err in imposing an enhanced penalty of actual incarceration for three years on defendant who possessed or used a gun while committing the specified crimes and it did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause by imposing multiple punishments for the same offense. The Double Jeopardy Clause protected defendant against a second prosecution for the same offense after an acquittal, protected against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction, and protected against multiple punishments for the same offense. The imposition in one trial of cumulative punishments under two criminal statutes that prohibited the same conduct was not a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.11 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.71 reflected the legislative intent that if defendant committed felonious assault by the use of a deadly weapon and the weapon was a firearm, then he should be sentenced to a three-year term along with the indefinite terms for the felonious assault. This was just an enhanced penalty and the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The vehicle in which defendant was a passenger was stopped after driving left of the center line on three occasions. Police officers had begun following the vehicle after it matched a description of the offenders in the bar robbery. After stopping the vehicle, officers observed in plain view a blue cloth material which was either a ski mask or a cap, a shotgun shell, a long knife, and a bong. Later written consents to search the vehicle were obtained from defendant, from the driver, and from defendant's mother, the owner of the vehicle, and the articles sought to have been suppressed were then obtained as a result of a search of the vehicle. The court concluded that the stop of the vehicle was lawful, that the observation of the articles in plain sight was lawful, and that the subsequent search of the vehicle pursuant to consent was authorized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city informed defendant that his building was unsafe and hazardous and requested that defendant either remove or repair the unsafe portions. When defendant failed to do so, he was arrested for violating &sect; 1907.01(B) for keeping an unsafe structure. Defendant appealed his conviction, and the court affirmed. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal because the record contained competent, credible evidence that the building was unsafe, a nuisance, unsanitary, a fire hazard, and otherwise dangerous to human life and the public welfare. The trial court did not unduly restrict defendant's right to cross-examination, and it did not err in admitting photographs of the building into evidence for rebuttal purposes. There was no evidence of prosecutorial vindictiveness or selective discriminatory prosecution, and defendant's proposed jury instructions were not relevant to the criminal charge. Finally, the ordinance was not vague or overbroad, and thus it was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the specification in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A)(7) was unconstitutional as applied to him. He argued that because he was charged with aggravated murder under the felony murder theory, the underlying burglary should not have been used as an aggravating circumstance to impose a harsher sentence. Defendant also argued that he should not have been given consecutive sentences because he was not informed of the possibility of consecutive sentences and he was being punished for the same conduct twice. The court held that: (1) defendant's claim that the mitigating circumstances outweighed the aggravating circumstances could not be raised because he pleaded guilty; (2) the legislature manifested a clear intent to provide an enhanced penalty to a person found guilty of both aggravated murder and one of the several felony specifications; (3) defendant's sentencing met the requirements of Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(C)(2)(a) and did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause; and (4) consecutive sentences could be imposed for aggravated murder and aggravated burglary, even though the aggravated burglary was the underlying felony used to establish the aggravated murder.</SPAN></P>

The court held as follows: (1) defendant was not guilty of disorderly conduct under &sect; 2917.11(A)(1) because he was not accused of engaging in fighting, or in threatening harm to persons or property, but rather that he acted in a violent or turbulent behavior; (2) defendant did not violate &sect; 2917.11(A)(2) defendant was simply exercising his right of free speech; (3) defendant was not profane in any way nor did he threaten either guard with harm; (4) the guards testified that defendant was &quot;loud,&quot; and that he was &quot;yelling,&quot; but such in and of itself did not constitute making unreasonable noise, considering the nature of his provocation; and (5) referring to someone as a &quot;dumb briar&quot; did not constitute unwarranted and grossly abusive language.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction, in the Franklin County Municipal Court (Ohio), for operating a motor vehicle at a time when he had a concentration of .10 gram or more by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of breath, in violation Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3), and raised as a single assignment of error that the trial court erred in overruling his motion for dismissal based on the unconstitutionality of &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) as applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that it had upheld the official constitutionality of Ohio Rev Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3), but that defendant raised a slightly different issue, contending that &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was unconstitutional as applied to him. Defendant was arrested and tried in a jury trial upon two charges arising from the same conduct, one a violation of &sect; 4511.19(A)(3), of which he was convicted, and the other an alleged violation of &sect; 4511.19(A)(1), of which he was acquitted. The court found nothing unreasonable in the legislative conclusion that one who had consumed sufficient alcoholic beverages as to cause the alcoholic content of his breath to be .10 percent constituted a sufficient hazard when operating a motor vehicle as to prohibit such a person from operating a motor vehicle, irrespective of whether it was, or could be, proved that he was under the influence of alcohol. There was no constitutional requirement that proof that a particular person was not under the influence of alcohol constituted a defense to the offense of operating a motor vehicle after having consumed sufficient alcohol to cause one's breath to contain .10-percent alcohol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate appealed from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) sustaining a motion of defendant Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction to dismiss his complaint for a declaratory judgment upon the ground that there had been no violation of the inmate's legal rights. In support of his appeal, the inmate raised three assignments of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although first or second degree murder were specifically mentioned in former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5143.03, these were the only types of murder contained in the Criminal Code when that statute was adopted. In 1980, the types of murder defined by the Criminal Code were aggravated murder and murder, which replaced the former crimes of first and second-degree murder. Accordingly, in interpreting &sect; 5143.03, the sensible approach consistent with valid statutory-construction principles was to delete the words &quot;first or second degree&quot; and to give continued meaning to the last paragraph of &sect; 5143.03 by interpreting it to mean that those convicted of murder, regardless of degree, are not eligible for commitment to the reformatory. The declaration that no legal right of the inmate had been violated served the same purpose as a more specific declaration that the Department had the authority to transfer him to the penitentiary because he was ineligible to be sentenced to the reformatory. Under Ohio law, the place of incarceration was not primarily a judicial function but, rather, was ultimately vested in administrative agencies by virtue of statutes, including Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.20.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3). In consolidated appeals, defendants challenged the constitutionality of Ohio's breath alcohol law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants were tried and convicted of driving under the influence. Each appealed the conviction. The appeals were consolidated. Defendants argued that the statute was vague and overbroad, and illegally shifted the burden of proof to them by creating a conclusive presumption in favor of the State that the test results, which may have been taken up to two hours after the last operation of the vehicle, demonstrated the alcohol level of a defendant at the time of the violation. The court overruled the assignments of error. Section 4511.19(A)(3) passed muster under the Fourteenth Amendment and was a constitutional enactment designed by the General Assembly to meet a clear and pressing need, fashioned in a manner appropriate to such need. The court further overruled one defendant's argument that his conviction was against the weight of the evidence, based on his claim that his blood alcohol level might have been below the critical point when driving, holding that no testimony was provided directed at defendant's blood alcohol weight which would have effectively aspersed the weight or sufficiency of the State's evidence with respect to the violation of &sect; 4511.19(A)(3).</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that defendant's expert witness was not qualified to testify as an expert witness. A finding of disqualification as to that expert witness in a previous case was confined to that case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State indicted defendant for knowingly Possessing a Dangerous Ordnance, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.17, and Aggravated Arson, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.02(A)(2). Defendant pled no contest to the arson charge; the ordnance charge was dismissed.

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant entered the no contest plea, he filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, which challenged the constitutionality of the statutory provisions under which he had been indicted. Defendant admitted that he set fire to his residence. His wife was in the home. Defendant stated that he had no intent to injure his wife or anyone else. The fire caused $ 22,000 in damage; the wife escaped unharmed. Although defendant was intoxicated and under stress, he did not dispute that he had acted knowingly. The trial court convicted defendant. The court affirmed. Defendant was aware that his conduct--pouring gasoline in his home, lighting it, and causing a fire--would probably have caused a certain result: physical harm to an &quot;occupied&quot; structure. Ohio's legislation was a reasonable exercise of the State's police power. The legislation as applied to defendant did not operate to deny constitutional rights secured by the 14th Amendment. Arson was a particularly dangerous criminal activity because fires and explosions endangered not only the residents of the targeted property, but adjoining neighbors and neighborhoods, as well as firemen who answered the call of duty to extinguish them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record indicated that the applicant was denied a handgun owner's identification card because he had been convicted for carrying a concealed weapon and failure to have a valid handgun owner's identification card.

Both TMC &sect; 17-13-105(a) and TMC &sect; 549.09(a) prohibited any person from owning or possessing a handgun unless the person had a handgun owner's identification card issued to him and in effect at the time. Based on the foregoing the court affirmed finding that the trial court's decision to deny the applicant a handgun owner's identification card constituted a valid exercise of police powers, did not constitute error, was not arbitrary, did not violate due process or equal protection, and was not based upon retroactive legislation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church operated a senior citizen home. The church filed an application for a real property tax exemption for 1979 with the county auditor, claiming that the home was a home for the aged as defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5701.13. The commissioner denied the application on the ground that the senior citizen home did not qualify under the statute. The church then appealed unsuccessfully to the Board of Tax Appeals. On appeal to the court, the ruling was again affirmed. The church first argued that the Board of Tax Appeals erred in its application of the formula presented in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5701.13(B). The court ruled that the church's accounting statements, taken alone, indicated income in excess of 95 percent of the expenses of care. There was no evidence as to the source of the income. Therefore, the church failed to show, as required by statute, that not more than 95 percent of the expenses of care were paid by the residents or on their behalf. Thus, the Board of Tax Appeals did not err in affirming the denial of the church's application for exemption. The court disagreed with the church's argument that Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured claimed that her vehicle was caused to strike an embankment when being passed by an unknown driver.

The insured brought an action for a declaratory judgment that the physical contact policy provision was contrary to public policy and should be made void. The trial court granted the insurer's motion for summary judgment. In affirming, holding that under the natural and reasonable construction of the policy, the only conclusion to be reached was that the policy did not provide coverage for damages cause by unidentified drivers absent physical contact with the insured's vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county sheriff's department conducted a raid on a barn, the suspected scene of a cockfight, and found such an event in progress. Several game birds and paraphernalia discovered at the site were confiscated. Additionally, a large number of people were arrested and charged with violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 959.15, the Ohio animal fights statute. On appeal, the court held that, insofar as the statute proscribed an individual's mere presence at a scene or location of a cockfight, without any showing of culpable mental state of knowingly being present, it was unconstitutionally vague, regardless of whether birds were in fact engaged in combat at the time of defendants' arrest. The statute was also unconstitutionally overbroad in that it ensnared a right of association by penalizing individuals who were no more than physically present at or in proximity of a place which was currently being used, had previously been used, or would have been used in the future for animal fights. Thus, the convictions of defendants who were merely present at the cockfight were improper. The convictions of defendants who maintained the property or participated in the cockfight, however, were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of Dayton, Ohio, Ordinance 71.12(C).

While being taken to a cruiser, defendant told the officers voluntarily that the substances found did not belong to wife, who also lived at the residence. On appeal from defendant's conviction, the court held that: (1) the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress because the search did not exceed the scope of the authority granted in the warrant, even though the garage was not described in the warrant as being a separate building, and the refusal of admittance rule did not apply; (2) the trial court properly overruled defendant's Ohio R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's plea of no contest to the charge of murder followed by his finding of guilty did not bar application of Ohio Rev.

What mattered was only the &quot;fact of conviction,&quot; and appellant stipulated that he was convicted of the decedent's murder. Since appellant stipulated to a conviction under &sect; 2903.02, the fact of that conviction was properly before the court and was properly considered. Accordingly, where the decedent and the guilty party had a joint and survivorship bank account, the guilty party was considered to have predeceased the decedent, and the decedent was treated as the survivor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Ohio Department of Public Welfare and its Director, appealed from the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which found for plaintiff, a class of nursing homes. The nursing homes sought additional payment for services rendered to eligible Medicaid recipients under provider agreements with the Department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department established a payment rate to the nursing homes during the year that included a profit factor of $ 1.50 per inpatient day under a formula computed by the Department. The Department then adopted Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 5101:3-3-28 for adjustments in the rates necessitated by alleged incorrect computations made in the original determination of the rate. The nursing homes sought to avoid the effect of the temporary rule in changing the rates. The trial court held that the temporary rule was an unlawful impairment of the obligation of contract, an unlawful retroactive regulation, and inconsistent with both other rules and former Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 5101.51, which was in effect at that time. The court affirmed. Am. Sub. S.B. 221, &sect; 17 specifically prohibited retroactive changes once the rate was established. When the federal government finally approved the $ 1.50 maximum, the nursing homes were entitled to an additional 72 cents per in-patient day, which they erroneously had not been paid. Adopting a rule after the end of the year to provide for prohibited adjustments was an abuse of discretion by the Department, even if the rule could pass constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant church built a house of worship on 20 acres of land that it had purchased. The church filed a request for an exemption from real property tax pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5709.07. The hearing examiner recommended that the exemption be granted for the front eight acres and disallowed as to the remaining 12 acres. The Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio) approved the recommendations, and the church appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church contended that the land that served as physical support for the building should be exempted since it was necessary to the building. It also alleged that the remaining nine acres were necessary to further its religious purposes. The court held that the three acres provided the same type of physical support to the building and parking lot as the land situated directly beneath them. Therefore, the three acres were exempt from taxation under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5709.07. The tax commissioner found the back nine acres were used primarily for recreational purposes. To qualify for the exemption, the land, as well as the buildings thereon, must be used exclusively for public worship within the meaning of &sect; 5709.07. Accordingly, the board did not err in denying the exemption for the back nine acres of the parcel. The court noted that through the implementation of the exemption the state did not entangle itself in religion, nor did it in any way promote or inhibit religious freedom. Also, the statute was not void for vagueness; it was adequately specific in its terms to give fair warning to those to whom it applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The Board did not err in denying the exemption for the back nine acres of the parcel. However, denying the exemption as to the three acres that surrounded the building and formed the slope was unreasonable and unlawful.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 124.34 provided the employee with a substantive right, even though the trial court lacked jurisdiction under &sect; 124.34 because the &quot;action&quot; taken against the employee was not for disciplinary reasons; (2) the employee's substantive rights under &sect; 124.34 were circumscribed by the procedural constraints and, because she had neither been removed nor reduced in pay for disciplinary reasons, she had no substantive right of review; (3) the procedural availability of review found in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.01 antedated the substantive rights prescribed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.34, and such, the later statute controlled where a conflict existed; and (4) the trial court's decision was in accordance with the law and was not unconstitutional, arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A detective testified that she purchased an unopened can of beer at defendant's home and that she saw no liquor permits on the premises. A search warrant for the premises was executed and police officers observed persons drinking alcoholic beverages. Defendant was present. Defendant advised the officers, before she was arrested, that she owned the premises. The officers found a locked refrigerator and cabinets containing a large quantity of alcoholic beverages. A cash box was found in one of the cabinets. The officers saw no liquor permits on the premises. Defendant made incriminating statements. The officers failed to advise defendant of her Miranda rights. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction. Defendant's statements should have been excluded in view of the admitted failure of the officers to advise defendant that she had the right to remain silent, that she had the right to consult an attorney, and that any statements that defendant made could have been used against her in a court proceeding. The evidence against defendant was not so overwhelming as to render the trial court's error in admitting defendant's statements harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord owned a building that contained an apartment. The village terminated water service after the tenant failed to pay her water bill. The landlord sought declaratory and injunctive relief. After the landlord voluntarily dismissed his claims against the water department and its director, he filed a motion for summary judgment with regard to the village. The trial court denied his motion and dismissed his complaint. The landlord appealed from that judgment, which was affirmed. New Miami, Ohio, Ordinance 1178, &sect; VIII (May 3, 1979) imposed liability on the property owner for the water and sewer services supplied by the village. That ordinance also provided that service would be terminated if a statement was not timely paid. The court noted that an ordinance that imposed liability on the property owner for all water and service charges, regardless of the name listed on the account, was permissible under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 4. The court, after considering other states' case law, stated that the next logical extension of that principle was an ordinance similar to the one enacted by the village and, therefore, found that the ordinance was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Thirty years later, appellant filed with the board a request to vacate the &quot;reserved&quot; strip. The board found that the strip had not been used as a public way for at least 21 years, and it vacated the &quot;road.&quot; Appellee appealed from the board's order to the common pleas court, which entered a judgment reversing the order and remanding the matter to the board. The court reversed the judgment and held that the board's resolution of vacation was validly entered. The court held that (1) under Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were Amish and separately proceeded with the construction of residential dwellings without obtaining building permits. They were found guilty of violating the building code, and they appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the prosecutions as violating their rights to free exercise of their religious beliefs. The court held that there was a compelling interest in enforcing the building code by requiring residential housing to meet minimum construction standards and that the authority to do so was within the police power of the State. The court also held that the method used by the State to accomplish this objective was the least obtrusive means available. Defendants also argued that the trial court erred in sentencing them to fines in excess of the statutory limit and in sentencing them to multiple punishments for allied offenses of similar import. The court found that every day in which defendants continued to violate the building code constituted a separate offense for which they were subject to the fine. The court held that the violation of one of the defendants was limited to one day, so he should not have been fined for two.</SPAN></P>

The owner's property was located in a residential district. The owner filed an application for a building permit for the construction of a garage on his property, which was granted. The owner never applied for a variance permit from the village zoning board. On the owner's complaint, the village asserted that the owner impermissibly expanded his business and inventory of equipment and supplies beyond the scope of the protection afforded his prior non-conforming use under Minerva, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 1137.02. The trial court held that the increase in the volume of the owner's business did not deprive him of the right to continue his non-conforming use. On appeal, the court affirmed that the owner's garage was entitled to a permit because it met all of the building requirements. The use of the garage was not a violation of the village ordinances because it met the definition of &quot;private garage&quot; under Minerva, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 1133.01(9)(a).

Reliance on any other limitation period was misplaced, as was reliance on contrary case law that was decided prior to the passage of the Uniform Parentage Act. As to the application of laches, no authority supported application of it. Nor was the father entitled to relief based on errors in the admission of evidence. On the contrary, the father's admission regarding test results was properly introduced despite the exclusion of the results because they lacked foundation. Finally, the mother and child were proper parties, and the lower court did not err by finding paternity based in part on inadmissible evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance authorizing the purchase of a farm with payments to be made over a period of four years, but the authorizing ordinance did not enact a tax to guarantee the city's purchase obligation or provide for a sinking fund to pay the indebtedness it assumed. The taxpayer, relying on &sect; 11, sought an injunction and declaratory judgment to prevent the enforcement of the ordinance. Later an ordinance was passed that provided for the imposition of a tax to pay off the city's indebtedness. The lower court held that the authorization portion of the ordinance was constitutional and that the financing portion of the ordinance, which was unconstitutional, could be severed from the authorizing portion of the ordinance. The court affirmed, holding that under &sect; 11, the original financing portion of the ordinance was unconstitutional because no tax was imposed to secure the city's debt to the seller of the land. The court further ruled that the later ordinance that provided for the imposition of a tax was remedial, and it was properly used to validate the authorizing portion of the original ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arresting officer observed defendant sitting in his vehicle smoking a marijuana cigarette. The officer approached defendant and asked him for identification. Defendant presented the officer with identification bearing a name the officer was familiar with, and the officer knew that defendant was not that person. Defendant was then placed under arrest and his vehicle was impounded. During an inventory search of the vehicle, officers discovered a considerable amount of marijuana in the vehicle's trunk, along with a triple-bean scale. Defendant was charged with marijuana trafficking. He sought to suppress the marijuana and the scale, but the trial court denied his motion. A jury found defendant guilty. He appealed his conviction, but the court affirmed. The court held that the warrantless search of defendant's vehicle was reasonable. Defendant's arrest was based upon probable cause that he had committed two crimes: possession of marijuana and presenting the drivers' license of another person. Furthermore, defendant's vehicle was lawfully impounded, and opening the trunk was properly within the scope of an inventory search.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the decision, the court found that the amendments to the statutes increased the penalties in some instances, and in other instances, the amendments did not reduce the penalties applicable before they took place. According to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(B), there was no effect upon the prior statutes in that the penalty was not reduced. If the penalty were reduced, defendant would be entitled to imposition of a penalty according to the statute as amended pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(B).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient contended that the statute under which he was involuntarily hospitalized was unconstitutional if it contemplated his actions because his behavior was merely bothersome.

The patient sought a continuance at the probable cause hearing because he had never before seen his court-appointed counsel. The court reversed the trial court's denial of the motion. The patient was in need of treatment. He was initially transported to the state hospital after creating disturbances at a police station that resulted in his arrest for trespass. Upon his initial admission to the hospital, he was in an agitated, belligerent, and confused. He initially refused to take medication, threatened the staff, was delusional, and was paranoid. Prior to the incident at the police station, he was involved in a fistfight that resulted in injuries requiring hospital emergency room care.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff 's original action was brought against a hospital, which paid plaintiff a settlement and secured a covenant not to sue. The trial court found that the remaining defendants failed to make a good faith effort to settle the case during the entire course of the proceedings and that plaintiff expressly did not fail to make a good faith effort to settle. On appeal, defendants contended that the trial court erred because they did not fail to make a good faith effort to settle for purposes of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1343.03(C). On review, the court held that there was certainly sufficient evidence before the trial court to find that defendants did not in good faith attempt to settle the matter. The trial court had determined the relative positions of the parties with respect to mandatory levels at which actual settlement could have been achieved on many occasions. The trial court correctly found that &sect; 1343.03 had retroactive application to cases pending at the time the statute was enacted. Further, pre-judgment interest could not be determined until there was a judgment, and the judgment in the case was rendered after &sect; 1343.03(C) was effective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nursing home filed a cause of action on behalf of all other Ohio nursing homes that provided nursing care under the Medicaid program. The complaint alleged that Ohio nursing home providers were to receive a predetermined prospective payment for all routine administrative and general services from the Ohio Department of Public Welfare. The director sought to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. The trial court dismissed the suit on the basis that the subject matter of the action was pending elsewhere and that the nursing home had not exhausted all of the administrative remedies available. The nursing home appealed, contending that the trial court erred in dismissing the case for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. While it could reasonably be concluded that the nursing home's actions were within Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.02, the Declaratory Judgment Act, and that a real controversy existed between the parties, the court was unable to hold from a review of the record that speedy relief was necessary for the preservation of rights that might otherwise have been lost or impaired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Franklin County Municipal Court (Ohio). In his assignment of error, he contended that Columbus, Ohio, Code &sect; 2133.01(B)(2) was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to provide motorists with reasonable means of ascertaining and avoiding the conduct proscribed by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In support of his assignment of error, he further argued that it was not within the power of the legislative authority to impose &quot;strict criminal liability&quot; for a condition that could not be readily ascertained, i.e. that a person's blood-alcohol level exceeded the specified concentration. The court overruled his assignment of error and upheld the judgment of the trial court. The court first noted that criminal intent was not a necessary element of every crime in Ohio, where crimes were defined by statute. Next, the court noted that it was within the power of the legislative authority to place a burden upon an actor of ascertaining at his peril whether he was acting within the prohibition of a statute that was targeted at protecting innocent members of the public from inherently dangerous conduct, as long as the burden was neither unfair nor unreasonable. Therefore, considering the danger inherently posed to the public by drinking drivers, the court held that it was both fair and reasonable to require a person who elected to operate a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol to ascertain at his peril whether he consumed the quantity proscribed by Columbus, Ohio, Code &sect; 2133.01(B)(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had restricted visitation rights of two minor daughters and the father had custody. After defendant picked up her daughters at school and took them out of state on a two-week vacation, the father filed a child stealing complaint against her. On review, the court held that defendant had not demonstrated that the legislature's failure to provide a definition of the phrase &quot;with purpose to withhold&quot; in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.04 rendered the statute constitutionally defective. Common usage indicated that &quot;withhold&quot; in the context of the statute meant that a person may not legally deprive a custodial parent of custody of a child without authority or consent. However, the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of interference with custody because the evidence, considered most favorably to defendant, would have supported a finding of not guilty of the charge of child stealing. The evidence showed only that defendant took the children for a vacation and returned them at the end of the vacation, and there was no evidence of criminal intent or specific intent of the purpose to withhold the children from the legal custody of the father.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Maumee Municipal Court (Ohio), which convicted him upon a &quot;no contest&quot; plea of driving with a specified blood-alcohol concentration (BAC), a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3). Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the average citizen could not understand &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) and could not determine the statute's standards for guilt without consulting an expert. Defendant contended that the ordinary citizen was not able to know, in advance, what conduct, or level of conduct, was actually proscribed or when his BAC exceeded the statutory limits of intoxication. Accordingly, since the prohibitions were not clearly defined, the statute should be found void for vagueness. The court disagreed. It found that defendant's argument was irrelevant to the constitutional argument. A statute could be found in violation of &quot;due process&quot; only if the language was so vague that the average person had no notice of what conduct was prohibited. The statutory provisions of &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) spelled out specific BAC limitations that indicated when an individual violated the law. The statute was a credible deterrent which directly promoted the state's effort to save lives and prevent property destruction caused by individuals who drove while intoxicated. The specificity of the provision provided fair notice to the potential &quot;drunk driver&quot; of what conduct was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant worked as the executive director of the humane society. The individuals went to the humane society to try to get a refund back for a dog they had bought that had died and to be reimbursed for the veterinarian bill. Defendant confronted the individuals, and he allegedly jabbed one of the individuals, pushed his back against a desk and made various verbal threats. The verbal opinion of the trial court indicated that defendant's behavior constituted turbulent behavior in violation of &sect; 2917.11(A)(1). On appeal, the court reversed and found that the term &quot;turbulent behavior&quot; was not sufficiently definite to inform members of society at which point their conduct became impermissible and in of violation of &sect; 2917.11(A)(1). The court reasoned that because the conviction could not rest on an unconstitutional ground, it must be reversed and defendant discharged. The court also determined that since &sect; 2917.11(A)(1), as applied by the trial court, was unconstitutionally vague, no evidence could justify a verdict or finding of guilt. The charge was too vague and ill defined to sufficiently notify defendant of the criminal conduct charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of improvement made to the property owned by the landowner, a special assessment was placed on the land. The special assessment constituted a lien on the property and was to run for a period of 10 years. The landowner conveyed a portion of the property to a bank. The portion represented 31.8 percent of the total frontage of the parcel before the conveyance. The bank leased the land to the lessee, and the lessee was obligated to pay all taxes, including special assessments. The lessee was allocated 31.8 percent of the special assessment. The lessee asserted that the assessment was unconstitutional and illegal under Ohio law. The lessee argued that it was entitled to declaratory judgment and injunctive relief because it had no adequate remedy at law, asserting that it lacked standing to object to the special assessment at the time it was assessed. In affirming the trial court's dismissal, the court concluded that the lessee was not contesting the original assessment, but rather the propriety of the apportioned assessment post-conveyance. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 319.42 specifically provided a remedy once the special assessment had been split due to the conveyance.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the presumption of the regularity of trial court actions was not overcome because the trial date was not out of rule and the entry that set it was not flawed where the record did not show defendant pressed for rulings or that he did not get them within a reasonable time; (2) in the absence of any indication that the request for other counsel was for purposes of delay or not in good faith, failure to honor defendant's timely request amounted to a denial of effective assistance of counsel; and (3) it was impossible to determine whether defendant made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel because the state failed to prove defendant was competent by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adjacent landowners and the property owner were all members of a planned unit development (PUD). The PUD only allowed an attached garage and no accessory building. The property owner had sought to construct a storage building, and when the architectural control committee (committee) failed to act on the application, the property owner obtained permission from the township to construct the building. The court found that as a matter of law there was a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the board's record for the trial court to affirm the decision of the board because the application complied with the township's ordinances. The court reversed the trial court's declaration allowing the construction, finding that it was error to hold that the committee's failure to respond to the property owner's application was tantamount to acquiescence or tacit approval of the construction. The court found that the restriction was not ambiguous and that it was error for the trial court not to construe it appropriately.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that all claims were time-barred and granted summary judgment to the architect and the contractor. The corporation appealed.

On appeal from defendant's subsequent conviction, the court rejected defendant's claim that &quot;Miranda&quot; warnings should have been issued. Further, the court found that the facts provided more than sufficient probable cause for the trooper to believe that defendant was operating his motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol. Section 4511.19(A)(2) did not create a conclusive presumption of &quot;under the influence.&quot; Possession of a prohibited blood-alcohol content at the time of driving was an element of the offense and had to be proved by the prosecution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's request to present evidence of his conduct surrounding the events in question in defense of the allegation that his breath-alcohol level was too high. On appeal, the court overruled defendant's claims that there was insufficient proof of the truth of the crime charged, that the trial court admitted the intoxilyzer test results absent a sufficient demonstration of calibration, and that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was unconstitutionally vague. The court ultimately found that denying defendant his constitutional right to present evidence in his behalf mandated reversal and a new trial. Whether or not defendant acted drunk had some persuasive relationship to the issue of whether his breath-alcohol level was too high. The court acknowledged that the State was not required to prove that defendant's ability to drive was adversely affected. However, defendant was entitled to present all relevant evidence that tended to discredit the validity of the mechanical test results, including evidence corroborating his claim that he had not been drinking at all.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for an alcohol related offense. On appeal, he argued that &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was unconstitutionally vague. He also argued that the Ohio General Assembly could not impose &quot;strict criminal liability&quot; for a condition that could not be readily ascertained, that a person's &quot;breath-alcohol&quot; level exceeded the specified concentration. On review, the court held that it was both fair and reasonable to require a person, who elected to operate a motor vehicle after having consumed alcoholic beverages, to ascertain, at his peril, whether he had consumed a specific level of alcohol. In view of the danger inherently posed to members of the public by drinking drivers, the court held that determining whether a person's &quot;breath alcohol&quot; concentration had reached the level proscribed by &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was justified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent employee suffered an accident that caused electrical burns and caused him to fall 35 feet. He had second and third degree burns over 60 to 70 percent of his body and was immediately hospitalized. A claim for benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act was filed. Three days later his leg was amputated and he died two days later. A claim for death benefits was then filed. The trial court granted the employee's widow benefits under &sect; 4123.57(C) for amputation of decedent's leg. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the widow was entitled to loss of leg benefits under the statute, which entitled the worker to benefits for 200 weeks for the loss of a leg. At trial, the widow successfully argued that the portion of the statute that distinguished between surviving families of workers who died from industrial-related causes and surviving families of workers who died from other causes was invalidated because it violated equal protection. The only reason to maintain a distinction was to reduce the cost to the Workers' Compensation Fund; however, conserving funds was not a viable basis for denying compensation to those entitled to it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that there were no legal or procedural impediments that prevented appellants from maintaining a declaratory judgment action. The appeal challenged the trial court's ruling that appellants had to pursue an initiative referendum to change a village zoning ordinance before they could raise the constitutionality of the subject zoning in a declaratory judgment action. The court stated that property owners had a right to attack the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance by means of a declaratory judgment action.To bring such an action, however, a landowner had to first exhaust all administrative remedies, unless it was clear that the administrative remedies were not equally as serviceable as a declaratory judgment action, were unusually expensive or onerous, constituted vain acts, or if the administrative agency did not have the authority to grant the relief sought. Under the village charter, there was no administrative remedy available to appellants since no administrative agency existed which could provide appellants appropriate relief. Therefore, the failure to exhaust administrative remedies was not an available basis for the dismissal of appellants' complaint.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Common Pleas, Lake County (Ohio) sentenced defendant to one to ten years' imprisonment for the auto theft conviction and six months to five years for the possession conviction, to be served concurrently.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed on appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to give defendant's requested jury instruction on the issue of the reliability of eyewitness identification. Defendant also claimed that &sect; 2923.24 was void for vagueness. The court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give the requested instruction because the trial court's instructions contained substantially the same information as that contained in defendant's construction. Further, the court found that defendant waived his challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 2923.24 by failing to raise such an objection in the trial court. However, the court held that defendant's conviction for possession of criminal tools could not stand because the prosecution failed to prove that he acted with the requisite criminal intent. The court noted that the &quot;criminal tool&quot; was a van and that in order to sustain a conviction under &sect; 2923.24 for possession of an object that had legitimate purposes, the prosecution was required to show that the object was possessed under circumstances indicating a criminal purpose.

Defendant told the police officer that he would not stop playing. On review, the court affirmed his conviction. The court held that the trial court properly quashed the subpoena of two witnesses because it was not served properly and because the witness's testimony was not proffered into the record, the record failed to demonstrate that defendant was prejudiced by the ruling of the under Ohio R. Evid. 103. The court concluded that the trial court's denial of defendant's request for a bill of particulars was proper because it was not timely made. Defendant's request for the bill of particulars was not made until December 1, 1982. On November 24, 1982, defendant represented to the trial court that he was fully prepared to go to trial and that he knew what the charge against him. While defendant was denied a bill of particulars, he did receive discovery which, taken with the statements in the charging document, sufficiently informed him of the nature and cause of the accusation against him so that he could have prepared his defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were cited for nonmoving traffic violations. The city filed a motion to require defendants to show proof of financial responsibility in order to request sanctions under Am. Sub. S.B. 250 (Ohio) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101. The trial court found that &sect; 4509.101 was unconstitutional on its face and overruled the city's motion. The city filed a motion for leave to appeal. On appeal, defendants moved to dismiss the motion on the ground that the trial court's judgment was not a final appealable order. On review, the court held that the proceeding was a special proceeding under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2505.02. The judgment entry was a proceeding where the law conferred a right, and authorized a special application to a court to enforce it, and was therefore a special proceeding within the ordinary meaning of the term and was appealable. Defendants claimed that the city's only appeal on the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101 was pursuant to the administrative appeal contained in that statute. The court determined that the issue of whether the city's remedy was an administrative appeal was one of the questions that had to be determined on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, a police officer testified that, while investigating liquor law violations, he visited a club where defendant danced, and after her performance, defendant solicited him to engage in prostitution for $ 175, saying she had a room at a particular hotel. Defendant testified that she was not staying at that hotel on the night in question and offered receipts from a different hotel as proof, which the trial court refused to admit. On appeal, the court ruled that because defendant failed to include the receipts with the record on appeal, it could not determine their evidentiary value, nor declare that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to admit them. Because the ordinance prohibiting solicitation did not distinguish among offenders based on race, religion, gender or economic status and it bore a rational relationship to the government's interest in prohibiting prostitution, it was constitutional. However, because the solicitation ordinance carried a maximum sentence that was greater than the ordinance proscribing disorderly solicitation, and both offenses contained the same elements, the sentencing provision of the solicitation ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Bowling Green Municipal Court (Ohio), which denied his motion to dismiss and convicted him of driving while under the influence of alcohol in violation of Bowling Green, Ohio, Code of Ordinances &sect; 73.01(A)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He pled not guilty and filed a motion to dismiss the charge, contending that &sect; 73.01(A)(3) was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, whereupon defendant entered a plea of no contest to the charge, was found guilty, and was sentenced. On appeal, defendant asserted that it was error for the trial court to deny his motion to dismiss for the reason that &sect; 73.01(A)(3) was unconstitutional. He contended that the ordinance did not provide fair notice to drivers as to when their blood alcohol content exceeded .10 percent. The court held that defendant failed to show that the ordinance was clearly unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore Bowling Green, Ohio, Code of Ordinances &sect; 73.01(A)(3) was sufficiently clear and definite to inform persons of ordinary intelligence what their conduct had to be in order to conform to the ordinance's requirements and to advise a person who was accused of violating the ordinance what constituted the offense with which he was charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the municipal court was affirmed, and the case was remanded for execution of sentence and assessment of costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant restaurant sought review of a decision of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which affirmed the decision of appellee city board of zoning appeals regarding the restaurant's sign and determined that it had no jurisdiction to rule on the restaurant's constitutional issues because, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12, the Ohio Attorney General had not received notice of the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant had placed a sign upon its property and the sign remained on the property without challenge for nine years. The city then notified the restaurant that it was in violation of an ordinance that prohibited temporary advertising signs within the setback area of the property. The restaurant filed an application to receive a use permit for the sign, the denial of which was affirmed by the board. On appeal the restaurant argued that the trial court erred in deciding that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The court held that &sect; 2721.12 was inapplicable to the case and the restaurant was not required to serve notice of the action on the Ohio Attorney General, Therefore, the trial court erred in holding that it had no jurisdiction to rule on the constitutional challenges presented. The restaurant also contended that there was a difference between an advertising sign and a business identification sign under the ordinances. The court decided that the trial court properly affirmed the board's decision. Finally, the court concluded that the restaurant did not show that it was entitled to a variance because if any hardship existed, it was self-imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's affirmation of the decision of the board but reversed the trial court's ruling regarding its own jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges to the municipal ordinances. The case was remanded for a decision on the constitutionality of the challenged city ordinances.</SPAN></P>

The employee was then convicted of a felony and incarcerated in West Virginia. While a prisoner the employee filed a motion requesting that his temporary total disability benefits be extended. The Commission, relying solely on Ohio Industrial Resolution R80-7-57, ordered the employee's motion suspended until he was released from incarceration. R80-7-57 provided that because the State of Ohio had the authority to incarcerate persons convicted of crimes; an incarcerated claimant was forbidden from receiving compensation while incarcerated regardless of the medical evidence of disability. On appeal, the court reasoned that the policy reflected that because of a claimant's criminal acts, the State was required to incarcerate the person at its expense and that, therefore, payments from a State fund which had not become permanent prior to incarceration should not be commenced. The policy reflected in R80-7-57 had no application to the employee since he was incarcerated in West Virginia and not in Ohio. Accordingly, the court granted a writ a mandamus.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 3769-13-02, the &quot;absolute insurer&quot; rule, was unconstitutional because he was not the actual trainer at the time the drug was administered and the Commission knew who administered the drug and the reason why. The trainer argued that he was denied due process because the referee and then the Commission applied the wrong standard of proof against him. The court held that the &quot;absolute insurer&quot; rule essentially imposed liability without fault on the trainer of record and was proper under the circumstances and an exception to the rule was not applicable. The trial court's decision did not deny the trainer due process of law and any error committed was harmless because the Commission's decision was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence notwithstanding the application of the wrong standard of proof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felonious assault. He was late to court on one morning, and, despite the admonition of the trial court, failed to appear the following day. The trial court proceeded in defendant's absence, holding that his absence was voluntary. Closing argument, the jury charge, jury deliberations, and the verdict were all conducted in defendant's absence. Defendant appeared for sentencing the next day and claimed to have been detained by investigators. Defendant appealed his conviction, and the court reversed the trial court. The record did not support the trial court's factual finding that defendant was voluntarily absent. It reflected only that defendant was late one day. Defendant also claimed that the prosecutor's questioning of a witness's prior convictions was error. The court rejected this claim. Although the form of the prosecutor's question was improper, defense counsel was given ample opportunity to cross-examine the witness on his prior conviction and the collateral matters raised. Any error in permitting the prosecutor's inquiry was not substantially prejudicial to defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The court found that Ohio's capital punishment statute and the procedures set forth therein were proper and constitutionally sound in all respects. Additionally, weighing the mitigating factors of appellant's limited mental and social abilities and alcoholism against the particularly heinous nature of the aggravating circumstances of this offense, the court found that the aggravating circumstances clearly outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was without standing to challenge the constitutionality of the state code because he had not sustained injury by its enforcement. The municipal code section made it clear that the two activities of drinking and driving could not be mixed to the extent defined in the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed appeals from judgments of the Franklin County Municipal Court (Ohio), which convicted them of driving with a blood alcohol content in an amount prohibited by Ohio &sect; 4511.19(A)(3). Because their appeals raised an identical assignment of error, the cases were combined for disposition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that it was not illegal to drink and drive, and that an ordinary citizen had no means of knowing whether the amount that he drank placed him in violation of &sect; 4511.19(A)(3). Defendants contended that &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was unconstitutional, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because it failed to adequately notify defendants as to the act that was prohibited. On appeal, the court disagreed with defendants' contentions and upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 4511.19(A)(3). The court reasoned that the test for determining whether &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was in violation of the Due Process Clause because of vagueness was whether it gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that their contemplated conduct was forbidden by law. The court held that &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) warned anyone contemplating driving an automobile while drinking alcoholic beverages that there was a certain point at which they would have consumed sufficient alcohol to make their operation of a vehicle illegal. Thus, &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) gave fair warning to those contemplating driving while drinking alcohol that they take care not to exceed the point where driving was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

The statute provided in part that no person should operate any vehicle, within the state of Ohio if the person has a concentration of ten-hundredths of one gram or more by weight of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of his breath. Defendants appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that the statute adequately notified persons as to the act that was prohibited. The statute warned anyone contemplating driving an automobile while drinking alcoholic beverages that there was a certain point at which a person would have consumed sufficient alcoholic beverages to make illegal his operation of a motor vehicle. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was specific rather than vague. The vague laws allowed discriminatory enforcement because they failed to provide specific standards for enforcement.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19. A breath test was administered to him that resulted in a reading of .17 percent blood alcohol concentration. The trial court convicted defendant of driving while intoxicated and he appealed. The court affirmed and held that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3), an individual of ordinary intelligence was provided with constitutionally fair warning as to when his conduct became criminal. The court found that such notice first existed when the individual drank more than a small amount of an alcoholic beverage and then drove a vehicle. Subjectively, an individual of ordinary intelligence was given fair warning through his own senses. The court noted that when he consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his actions or mental processes were adversely affected, or that he had lost a clearness of intellect that he would have otherwise possessed, he had notice that he was impaired by the alcohol. The court held that through various means, an individual of ordinary intelligence had the ability to determine when the concentration of alcohol in the breath exceeded the legal limit.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and held that &sect; 303.99(a)(4) included any ordinance related to operating a motor vehicle. The court determined that the word &quot;operating&quot; included being in physical control of the vehicle.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the property owners argued that (1) the trial court erred by failing to deny the utility company's appropriation petition on the ground that the intended uses stated therein were beyond the statutory authority granted under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4933.15; (2) the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 163.09(B) were unconstitutional; and (3) the trial court erred in failing to find they were entitled to compensation for an easement of that property. Upon review, the court found the property owners' arguments without merit. The utility company planned to operate a telephone line on the poles solely to enable one electrical substation to talk to another. Such wires were necessary for the operation and maintenance of an electric plant and, thus, were permitted by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4933.15. The legislature had the authority to decide what constituted prima facie evidence and to prescribe the rules of evidence. Thus, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 163.09 was a constitutional enactment. Since the urban-rural distinction was abolished, the utility company's use of the county roadway to maintain its poles and wires was not an additional burden on the property owners' property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's intoxilyzer test produced a reading of .12. His motion in limine to exclude the test from evidence was overruled. The court held that the trial court erred in overruling the motion because the State failed to follow the proper procedures in conducting the test. Because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19 made it a violation to operate a vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration greater than the specified percentage whether or not the accused was under the influence of alcohol, strict compliance with the regulations of the director of health for intoxilyzer testing was required. The court held that the intoxilyzer was properly calibrated with the use of only one calibration solution. A chemist's affidavit regarding the calibration did not meet the requirements of Ohio R. Evid. 803(8) because defendant was denied the opportunity to examine the chemist. The trial court correctly prohibited defendant's expert from testifying on hypothetical matters not introduced into evidence. The jury instructions on blood alcohol concentration were adequate. Defendant waived the argument that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was unconstitutional by failing to raise it at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of a judgment from Lucas County Common Pleas Court, Juvenile Division (Ohio), which ordered that permanent custody of her child be given to appellee Lucas County Children Services Board. The mother argued that the trial court erred by failing to examine relative placement under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.414(B), finding that a good faith effort was made toward reunification, and in terminating parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that there should have been no termination of her parental rights absent a specific finding that there were no relatives of the child who were able to accept permanent custody. The court pointed out that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.414(B) required courts to make such a finding only when the child was orphaned. Because the mother's child was not orphaned, the trial court was not required to make such a finding. The court also rejected the mother's claim that the trial court should have found that the Board failed to follow through with efforts to reunify the child and his mother. The court noted that the mother missed nearly half of her required parenting class sessions, that she had an uncooperative attitude, and that she had been prohibited from attending further sessions because of her violent outburst against one of the caseworkers. The court found that the record was replete with testimony regarding the mother's violent outbursts and tendencies, and her lack of basic parenting skills. The court held that there was clear and convincing evidence that the child, if returned to the mother, would have been without adequate parental care.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment giving permanent custody of the child to the Board and remanded the case to the trial court for execution of judgment and assessment of costs. The court charged the mother with the costs of appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants had moved from their residences in the village because of marital problems.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of purposely causing the death of a seven-year-old child during a kidnapping. The court held that the Ohio statutory scheme respecting the death penalty was neither unconstitutional upon its face nor as applied to the accused upon the facts of the case. The court rejected defendant's remaining 17 assigned errors, generally finding that defendant raised such matters the first time on appeal, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in making its rulings, defendant was not denied his right to a fair trial and due process of law, or the assigned error was without merit. The court concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the death sentence was appropriate and that it was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. The sentencing court properly weighed the mitigating and aggravating circumstances and found that the aggravating circumstances, beyond a reasonable doubt, outweighed all the mitigating factors claimed by defendant. Finally, the court concluded that defendant's remorse consisted of being sorry that he was caught rather than being sorry for committing the crime.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the issues raised by the parents in an attempt to challenge the constitutionality of the statute merely went to the weight of the evidence.

The court held that (1) the trial court should have affirmed the board's decision because a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence for that decision existed in the transcript of the board's proceedings; (2) the employees' actions did not result in their unemployment and they were within their rights under their union's collective bargaining agreement with the employer to request vacation pay; (3) employees who found themselves on enforced vacations without pay were eligible to receive unemployment benefits where their employer, pursuant to a labor-management contract, allocated their vacations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his convictions in the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County (Ohio) for two counts of rape, two counts of kidnapping, and one count of gross sexual imposition. He contended that the trial court erred in failing to grant an evidentiary hearing on his motion in limine, in refusing a jury instruction requested by him, and in limiting his cross-examination of one of the victims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a pretrial motion in limine requesting that the prosecutor be ordered not to mention his prior convictions. The trial court did not hold a hearing and never ruled on the motion. At trial defendant testified as to his prior record during his direct examination. The court held that defendant waived any claim of error regarding the motion. Defendant contended that under the kidnapping statute the failure to release the victim in a safe place unharmed was an element of the first-degree felony offense of kidnapping, and the trial court was required to instruct the jury on the issue. The court held that safe release was a mitigating circumstance that lowered a first-degree felony to a second-degree felony. There was no evidence of safe release, so defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the issue. The trial court prevented defendant from questioning one of the victims about whether she was being treated for herpes at the time of the offenses. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Evidence of the victim's prior sexual activity was not admissible under Ohio's rape shield statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered judgment on a cognovit note and ordered garnishment of certain proceeds of an oil well lease to satisfy that judgment. The garnishee sought relief from the judgments, and the trial court refused to grant such relief. Affirming, the court found that the trial court did not err in failing to vacate the cognovit judgment because the garnishee's appellate counsel participated in the approval of his client signing the cognovit note in settlement of a prior law suit, and the judgment was not in an amount greater than was due on the face of the note. The trial court did not err in signing the post-judgment garnishment order because counsel was present at the hearing in respect to the garnishment proceedings. Even if the hearing was held too late to comply with the applicable statute, the alleged error did not rise to the level of want of due process. The claim that warrants of attorney to confess a judgment were unconstitutional was unpersuasive given the approving participation of counsel in its preparation to settle the previous law suit.

Although defendant was convicted also of a violation of Ohio Rev.

Affirming and remanding for execution of sentence, the court found that &sect; 4511.19(A)(4) was not unconstitutionally vague by reason that a person had no way of knowing when the alcohol content of his urine exceeded the statutory maximum. The statute was manifestly clear and constitutional. Even so, because the prosecution elected to have sentencing under &sect; 4511.19(A)(1), the sentence appealed from was not grounded upon &sect; 4511.19(A)(4). Even if the court agreed that the test results should not have been admitted because there was no showing that the specimen was refrigerated, defendant was not prejudiced by such admission because the lack of refrigeration would have caused the alcohol to evaporate more rapidly and caused an error in favor of defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board held a hearing and denied the petition for annexation on the ground that the record did not establish that annexation would serve the general good of the territory sought to be annexed and that the land included in the annexation petition, approximately three percent of the territory of the township, was unreasonably large. On appeal of the trial court's affirmance of the Board's decision, the court reversed and determined that the trial court erred in ruling that the Board's decision was supported by the evidence. Noting that the landowners presented unrebutted testimony that it was not economically feasible to develop their land under the existing zoning restrictions and that opponents to the petition presented no evidence to show that the landowners would be precluded from the development they sought if annexation was granted, the court concluded that the landowners presented sufficient evidence to show that the general good of the territory sought to be annexed would be served by annexation.

Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder and six counts of aggravated robbery. On appeal he argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in restricting cross-examination of state witnesses. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction. Five of the disputed questions concerned prior acts by the witnesses, which defense counsel apparently argued affected their credibility. He sought to show that two witnesses participated in illegal gambling, two received illegal welfare or unemployment compensation, and one participated in illegal liquor sales. Counsel could not challenge a witness' credibility with evidence of bad moral character. They may have sought to impeach a witness on cross-examination by questions about prior misconduct which related directly to truthfulness pursuant to Ohio R. Evid. 608(B). The trial court had discretion to determine whether the alleged prior conduct was clearly probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness. Hence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion and the cross examination was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2907.32(A)(2), which provided: (A) No person, with knowledge of the character of the material or performance involved, shall do any of the following: (2) Exhibit or advertise for sale or dissemination, or sell or publicly disseminate or display any obscene material.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for distributing obscene material in the operation an adult bookstore. Defendant first argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.32(A)(2) was void for vagueness. The court rejected this argument, finding that the statute was neither unconstitutionally overbroad nor void for vagueness. The court also rejected defendant's contention that his First Amendment rights of free speech were violated. The court found that defendant did not have the right to possess the material for himself, as the protection afforded one to possess obscene material was limited to one's home, and other areas or zones of constitutionally protected privacy, of which an adult bookstore was not one. Defendant further asserted that the trial court gave improper instructions to the jury, by failing to clearly articulate that all three prongs of the Miller test had to be satisfied for a conviction under the statute. The court found that the language of the instruction adequately provided for the jury the law necessary to determine the question as to whether or not the material before them was, under the law, obscene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The product in question, a butcher's meat grinder, left the factory with a guard to prevent the user from inserting his hand or arm into the machine; at some point, the guard was removed. The grinder ended up in Kentucky. The worker, in opposition to instructions, placed his hand into the grinder while it was operating to push against a frozen chicken that he was grinding. The worker slipped on the wet floor, and his hand and arm went into the machine. On appeal, the insurer and the worker urged that the trial court erred in deciding the case on Kentucky law. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in choosing Kentucky law. The presumption of the doctrine of lex loci delicti controlled disposition of the litigation because of limited contacts with Ohio, that is, the time lapse between the manufacture of the meat grinder and plaintiffs' choice of Ohio as the forum state. As for the manufacturer's duty to warn, the worker knew the dangers of inserting his hand into the machine and of slipping on the icy floor; the worker had previously slipped on the floor and injured himself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the manufacturer and remanded the cause to the trial court for execution of judgment and assessment of costs against the insurer and the worker.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that irrelevant testimony of an expert was admitted which portrayed him as a supplier of drugs to small children. The court found that the expert was properly qualified and his testimony properly admitted. The court also found that there was no error in presenting hypothetical questions to the expert because the questions reflected the facts of the case. Defendant challenged &sect; 2925.23(B)(1) arguing that it was overbroad, encompassing innocent behavior. The court found that it was inconceivable that defendant did not know his behavior was illegal; thus, his behavior was clearly not innocent. Defendant also argued that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of disorderly conduct after threatening a police officer with future harm. The court reversed the judgment and held that the utterance of such threats was not a crime violating constitutionally protected speech unless the threats were fighting words likely, by their very utterance, to have inflicted injury or provoked the average person to immediate retaliation. From the officer's testimony, to whom the threat of harm was allegedly made, defendant's words constituted a threat merely of future harm and such words were not as a matter of law likely, by their very utterance, to inflict injury or provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace. The court also held that defendant did not raise the issue of constitutionality of the ordinance in the trial court, so it was not reviewable. However, the court noted that the city ordinance was identical to that of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11. Finally, the court noted that the prosecutor did not violate Ohio R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant consented to a search of his home, and the police found party supplies and tools that belonged to a manufacturer. He was indicted on two counts of receiving stolen property worth $ 150 or more, but the trial court merged the counts and amended the indictment by substituting a single count for property with a value of more than $ 300. Defendant was found guilty, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the original indictment was for a fourth degree felony and that it comported with the version of &sect; 2913.51 that was in effect at the time of the offense. Thus, the trial court's amendment of the indictment did not change the nature of the offense charged as claimed by defendant. The court also concluded that the record contained sufficient evidence from which to infer that defendant possessed the stolen property. Defendant's consent to the search was not coerced.

The court found that the trial court had properly overruled defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground of entrapment, noting that the evidence demonstrated defendant's predisposition to commit the charged crimes. The court found that the trial court had not erred by refusing defendant's proffered jury instruction on the &quot;agent of the purchaser&quot; defense, noting that any person who offered to supply narcotics as a &quot;link in the chain&quot; was guilty of offering to sell as defined by &sect; 2925.03.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with operating a vehicle under the influence in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(1) and operation with a breath alcohol concentration of or in excess of .10 grams per 210 liters of breath in violation of &sect; 4511.19(A)(3). Defendant challenged the judgment of the Municipal Court of the County of Wayne, Ohio, which, on a plea of no contest, convicted him of violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant had filed a motion to dismiss on constitutional grounds. That motion was overruled. On appeal, defendant asserted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(1) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) were unconstitutional because they were vague, denied him right to confront and cross examine his accuser, and denied him of his right to a jury trial. The court declined to consider issues related to &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) because defendant was not convicted under it. The court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19 proscribed operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or both. The term &quot;under the influence&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague under the former statute. The court rejected the assertion that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(1) was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff car owner appealed the directed verdict granted to defendants city, police officer, and gas station by the Tiffin Municipal Court (Ohio) in her action for the return of funds she expended in retrieving an automobile from police impound pursuant to its impoundment for violating Tiffin, Ohio, Ord. &sect; 303.08 by having two different license plates on it. The owner had also sought a declaration of the unconstitutionality of &sect; 303.08.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the owner's car was parked on a city street, an officer noticed that it displayed two license plates, one registered to the owner's ex-husband to whom it had belonged and one registered to her, and he impounded the car pursuant to Tiffin, Ohio, Ord. &sect; 303.08(d). Because the effective certificate of title evidenced the ex-husband as owner, the owner was not notified of the impoundment and did not retrieve the car until three months thereafter. The city obtained judgment based on its argument that the owner failed to serve or join the state attorney general as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.22, as the owner sought declaratory relief regarding the constitutionality of a city ordinance. Concluding that the owner had no standing in her individual capacity to complain of the city's failure to provide notice to her at a time when the car was still registered to the deceased owner, the court affirmed the trial court's directed verdict in the city's favor. In so doing, the court determined that the ordinance was designed to protect the due process interests of the registered owner of the impounded car. Thus, the estate was due notice of the impoundment, but the owner was not.</SPAN></P>

The lower court found that the child was a dependent and neglected child, granted permanent custody to the county children services board, and terminated the parents' parental rights. The parents appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the record abundantly supported the trial court's finding that the natural parents also failed to properly care for the needs of two other children. The court held that the lower court did not err in finding that as between the natural parents, with residual parental rights, and the child, the child was a neglected child because of his parents' failure to meet their obligations even as related to their residual rights.

Plaintiff contended that the ordinance was not a valid emergency ordinance under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 731.30.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purpose of the ordinance was to authorize the issuance of bonds to provide funds for partial payment of the costs of expanding a municipal convention center. Section 9 of the ordinance declared the ordinance to be an emergency measure necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, safety, comfort, and welfare of the people of the city in that bonds therein authorized had to be authorized and issued immediately in order to provide for the orderly financing of the improvements therein described. Plaintiff contended that the ordinance failed to give any reason for the passage of the ordinance as an emergency measure. The court emphasized that the ordinance was designed to have immediate effect and that courts could not review the cogency of the reasons a legislative body gave for its declaration that an ordinance was an emergency measure. Nonetheless, upon analysis of the ordinance in its entirety, the court concluded that the reasons assigned by the city council for declaring the ordinance an emergency measure were valid legislative determinations and were not illusory, repetitious, or circular.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board and the commission, pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The board and the commission claimed that &sect; 140.051 provided an exemption from general competitive bidding laws for the contract. The taxpayer then filed an action to enjoin defendants from proceeding with the contract. He contended that &sect; 140.051 was enacted in violation of Ohio Const. Art. II, &sect; 15(C), which provided that every bill was to be considered by each branch of the legislature on three different days. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. On appeal, the court held that the language of &sect; 15(C), requiring a bill to be considered three times on three separate days in each house of the general assembly and the general assembly's journal to reflect such consideration, was mandatory and not directory. The court determined, therefore, that the complaint alleged facts that, if true, demonstrated a failure to properly comply with both the constitutional requirement and the house's own rules of procedure.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The coal company leased land from a farm for the purpose of mining coal.

To secure compliance with the strip mining laws, the corporation posted a performance bond for the license. After the mining corporation ceased mining, it assigned its lease to an augering corporation for performance of the reclamation. The division issued the mining corporation a notice of violation, alleging unacceptable reclamation due to erosion and failure of a successful cover of permanent nature in accordance with an approved reclamation plan and threatened forfeiture of the performance bond. The mining corporation unsuccessfully appealed to the board. On appeal, the court affirmed the board's decision upholding the notice, finding that despite the lease to the augering corporation, the mining corporation was the responsible party pursuant to the license. The court also found that the board's finding that the mining corporation took an active part in the mining of the licensed area was supported by credible evidence and was not arbitrary, capricious, or inconsistent with law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A witness testified that defendant told him that he was experiencing financial problems and asked if he knew anyone who would burn down a certain building. Defendant was tried and found guilty of arson. On review, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to dismiss, which was made based on defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.03(A)(4). In so holding, the court found that &sect; 2909.03(A)(4) was not void for vagueness, nor was it overbroad; it gave fair notice to a person of average intelligence of the specific conduct that was forbidden. Furthermore, the court rejected defendant's contention that the judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court found that the record contained substantial evidence of probative value upon which the trier of fact could reasonably conclude that the State established all the elements of arson beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditors were awarded a judgment against a judgment debtor, who in turn was awarded a judgment against the third-party debtor. The creditors' attorney filed an affidavit in aid of execution stating that appellants and their bank had certain money owing to the judgment debtor. The trial court issued an order in aid of execution ordering the three parties to hold all monies owing the judgment debtor. Appellants negotiated and paid a reduced judgment amount. The trial court found that the original attachment was valid. The court affirmed, finding that it was unnecessary for the affidavit in aid of execution to state the statutory grounds for attachment, because the creditors had commenced a garnishment process under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2333.13, and not a proceeding in aid of execution under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2333.01. The court held that notice of the garnishment process effectively created a lien on the judgment debtor's property in favor of the creditor, thereby rendering unnecessary the utilization Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2333.14. The court also held that appellants were not deprived of their constitutional rights because they were accorded a hearing by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2941.141. Defendant appealed and challenged the three years of actual incarceration mandated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.71(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.71(A) for possessing a firearm during the commission of a felony and possessing a weapon while under disability. Defendant claimed that there were no discernible standards and the statute gave the prosecution too much discretion in determining a sentence. The court decided that the statute gave a person of ordinary intelligence reasonable notice. The court pointed out that there was no showing that defendant was charged with a specification based upon an unjustifiable standard because the general assembly could reasonably conclude that the possession of firearms by persons under disability merited the mandatory prison term. The court found that the record did not indicate any evidence of unconstitutional discriminatory enforcement. The court pointed out that prosecutors had discretion over the charges brought and noted that the grand jury returned an indictment including the specification. The court determined that the statute was definite and contained adequate guidelines for enforcement. The court concluded that defendant demonstrated no due process violations and showed no infringement of equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the jury's verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence and that &sect; 3113.06 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV because: (1) it failed to provide the same classification of the criminal offense as Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.21, thereby discriminating against those persons whose children received ADC, (2) it failed to provide the affirmative defense contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.21(B), and (3) it failed to treat the sexes equally. The court determined that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3113.06 was constitutional because there was no classification that treated persons charged under &sect; 3113.06 differently than persons charged under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.21.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee sought review of an order of the Lake County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which denied his petition for a writ of mandamus against defendants, a city and its civil service commission. His petition sought to force the commission and city to reinstate his employment. The city's termination of his employment at the end of his probationary period was approved by the commission after a full hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee challenged his termination on grounds that his probationary period had already expired; therefore the reasons given for his termination, complaints and an unfavorable review by a supervisor, were not sufficient to support the decision. The trial court dismissed his petition upon defendants' motion pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6). The employee contended that dismissal was in error because his termination was contrary to the rules of the commission and that he had no plain and adequate remedy at law. He argued that he had no adequate remedy at law, in part, because a common pleas court did not have the power to review the commission's factual and legal conclusions. On appeal, the court found that argument without merit because a common pleas court had the authority to review the commission's decision with respect to both questions of law and fact pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 2506.01, 2506.04. Although the trial court, under its applicable standard of review, did not hear questions of fact in a de novo sense, it did evaluate the evidence to determine whether the commission's findings were supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>
