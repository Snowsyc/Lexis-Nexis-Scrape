<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband filed a bill of complaint against the wife for a divorce and custody of their three children. The wife filed a cross-bill for divorce and custody of the children. The trial court dismissed the husband's bill and granted a divorce in favor of the wife and awarded her custody of the children. The trial court also ordered the husband to pay alimony and counsel fees to the wife. The husband subsequently challenged the award of alimony and counsel fees on the basis that it was a denial of equal rights because of sex. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held it did not need to determine whether Md. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 46 rendered the statutes concerning alimony and the award of counsel fees to a wife unconstitutional where there was no strict necessity requiring the court to entertain the question. The court reasoned that the award of counsel fees and alimony to the wife was fully in accord with the laws of the state and the award was not vitiated by the constitutional mandate. The court concluded that the husband did not have standing to challenge that the statutes allowing for alimony and counsel fees were unconstitutional as applied to other persons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Caroline County (Maryland), which found defendant in contempt of the trial court's prior order requiring defendant to submit to an examination to determine whether defendant was a possible defective delinquent. Defendant had been convicted of larceny and assault and was sentenced to two consecutive 18-month sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant entered guilty pleas to a charge of stealing property worth less than $ 100 from an individual and to an assault charge. Following his conviction and sentencing, the trial court directed that defendant be delivered to a State institution for examination and evaluation of possible defective delinquency pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 31B. Defendant refused to submit to the testing, and the trial court entered an order directing defendant to show cause why he had not submitted to the examination. At the show cause hearing, the trial court once again ordered defendant to submit to the examination. Defendant again refused, and the trial court entered an order holding defendant in contempt. On appeal, defendant alleged, inter alia, that the contempt order had to be vacated because he could not be forced to submit to the examination in violation of his self-incrimination privilege. The court held, in affirming the trial court's judgment, that defendant's privilege against self-incrimination was no bar to compelling an examination for possible defective delinquency. The court also rejected the remainder of defendant's contentions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) which granted defendant's motion for post conviction relief, which alleged that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional. Defendant was convicted of violating the abortion laws, Md. Ann. Code art. 43, &sect; 139. The trial court found the statute unconstitutional and ordered the guilty plea stricken.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 139 on the ground that it violated the dictates of Roe v. Wade, 93 S. Ct. 705. Md. Ann. Code art. 43, &sect; 139 required an abortion to be performed by a licensed physician and in a hospital accredited and licensed by the State Board of Health and Mental Hygiene. The court held that the provision of the statute that specified acts were crimes if done other than by a licensed physician was not constitutionally proscribed. The court concluded, however, that the provision of the statute that abortions not performed in a hospital was a crime was unconstitutional on its face because a requirement that abortions be performed in a hospital, rather than in a doctor's office, was not based on differences that were reasonably related to the purpose of the statute and thus violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court also determined that the dictates of the Roe case were fully retroactive because defendant's conviction was based on an unconstitutional statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) of multiple counts of assault with the intent to commit murder and using a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and sentenced to prison for 63 years. A sentence review panel reduced his sentence to 53 years. He appealed the judgment of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err (1) in refusing to abate or stay the trial because of the pre-trial publicity; (2) in not dismissing the indictments; (3) in not rescinding its order for a mental examination of him, after he entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity; (4) in not allowing challenge to the array of jurors; (5) in not granting proposed voir dire questions; (6) in not permitting more than four peremptory challenges; (6) in its instructions to the jury; and (7) in not excluding testimony (i) concerning his sanity adduced from a doctor who acknowledged that he did not know the Maryland sanity test, (ii) concerning communications made by him to certain doctors, and (iii) concerning his sanity because it was admitted during the guilt stage of the proceedings. The court found that the voir dire questions put to the jury showed that no juror had formed an opinion, no juror had seen or heard anything which would prevent him from rendering a fair and impartial verdict based solely on the evidence adduced in court during trial, and no juror had reason not to be able to render a fair and impartial verdict based solely on such evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant mounted two constitutional attacks upon his conviction: (1) That Section 15 (e), either on its face or as applied to the particular facts of this case, was an unconstitutional abridgment of the freedom of speech guaranteed by the U.S. Const. amend. I; and (2) that Section 15 (e) was unconstitutional under the U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV because of vagueness and overbreadth. On appeal, the court held that there was no First Amendment impediment to the conviction at bar. The court held that if consummated crimes themselves were constitutional in terms of their criminality, then constitutionality followed as to their incipient or inchoate phases. The court also held that if the consummated crimes of prostitution, lewdness, to wit, unnatural sexual practices, and assignation, were not themselves unconstitutional for vagueness or for overbreadth, and it had been held that they were not, then it followed that the ancillary and inchoate crime of soliciting the commission of an act of prostitution, lewdness or assignation was similarly not unconstitutional for vagueness or for overbreadth. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court held that from the facts, the jury could have been fairly convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the substance recovered was marijuana. Under the circumstances, the circuit court properly denied the motion for a judgment of acquittal and properly submitted the issue to the jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Maryland State Board of Motion Picture Censors, sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), which reversed the Board's decision and ordered the Board to grant a &quot;seal of approval&quot; to appellee film distributor. The Board brought its appeal under the &sect; 256 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Md. Ann. Code art. 41, &sect; 256.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Invoking Md. Ann. Code art. 66A, &sect; 6, the Board refused to issue the distributor a license to exhibit an allegedly obscene film. The circuit court reversed the decision and ordered the Board to issue the license. The Board attempted to appeal the circuit court's order under the APA, arguing that it was an aggrieved party as defined by APA &sect; 256, Md. Ann. Code art. 41, &sect; 256. The court dismissed the appeal. Citing Md. Ann. Code art. 66A, &sect; 19 (1965), which conferred exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from the Board upon the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, the court concluded that the legislature had intended to exclude the Board from the ambit of the APA. The court found that Md. Ann. Code art. 66A, &sect; 19, which governed review of the Board's licensing decisions, only granted a right to appeal to the person whose film was disapproved by the Board and only after the circuit court had disapproved the film. The court noted, moreover, that even if it assumed that the Board had the right to appeal it would have been forced to conclude that the film did not constitute hardcore pornography as defined by Md. Ann. Code art. 66A, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three defendants appealed judgments from the Circuit Court for St. Mary's County (Maryland), which convicted them of conspiring to murder two victims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the testimony of one of the conspirators was admissible against his co-conspirators without the necessity of establishing, through an independent source, the existence of the conspiracy, subject only to the general rule that the testimony of the accomplice had to be corroborated. To buttress the testimony of the co-conspirator, the state produced a witness who placed two of the three defendants together when statements were made relative to killing the first victim. However, because there was no corroboration of the co-conspirator's testimony as to the conspiracy to slay the second victim, the court reversed as to the third defendant for conspiring to murder the second victim. The court also held that it was reversible error for the trial court to allow the jury to consider and convict the two other defendants of conspiring to murder the first victim after the trial court had granted a judgment of acquittal for that offense, and vacated those judgments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant allegedly robbed a fellow construction worker. He was indicted for armed robbery on May 20, 1970, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Defendant's last known address was in Washington, D.C. (D.C.), so a copy of the warrant was forwarded to the D.C. police department on June 2, 1970. Because defendant could not be found, the case was transferred to the stet docket. On September 14, 1971, the D.C. police returned the warrant, stating that they were unable to locate defendant. On October 5, 1971, extradition was authorized, and other law enforcement agencies were notified of the warrant. Defendant was arrested and returned to Maryland in March 1972. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of a speedy trial and a motion for habeas corpus. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss and denied the motion for habeas corpus. On appeal, the court reversed the order dismissing the indictment. The court held that: (1) fault, if any, on the part of the Maryland police was minimal; (2) the period of delay was not substantial; and (3) there was no prejudice to defendant's person and only the most speculative possibility of prejudice to defendant's defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree. On appeal, defendant argued that it was reversible error for him to testify without being advised on the record of his right to refuse to testify. The court invoked former Md. R. 1085 and affirmed defendant's conviction because that issue was not raised in the circuit court. Defendant then filed in the circuit court a post conviction petition, contending that he did not knowingly elect to testify and that he was entitled to a new trial. The circuit court found that defendant was not advised of his right not to testify and ordered a new trial. The state appealed and the court reversed. Because defendant elected to testify, he waived his privilege against subsequent cross-examination. Because he was represented by counsel, the circuit court was not required to render any advice about his election to testify or not to testify. In the face of overwhelming evidence against him, defendant's only rational choice was to assert self-defense, and counsel's decision to put him on the stand was therefore a matter of trial strategy. Accordingly, defendant's personal waiver of his right against self-incrimination was not required.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the warrant's description of the dwelling complied with the constitutional and statutory requirements, noting that the warrant accurately described the dwelling's physical characteristics and general location and that the occupants of the home were named in the supporting affidavit. The court rejected defendants' contention that the warrant was defective because it identified the home as being on the left-hand side of the street, rather than on the right-hand side, noting that the officers who executed the warrant had located the home without stopping to inquire as to its location.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A Criminal Court of Baltimore City (Maryland) convicted defendant of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon. Defendant made three collateral attacks on all three of the judgments under post-conviction proceedings and sought leave to appeal from the denial of his third petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that he was denied due process when the State failed to afford him a waiver hearing regarding juvenile court jurisdiction over his case. The court held that the trial was proper with respect to the murder charge but that the convictions on the robbery charges were a nullity. On cases not final as of 15 May 1969, the court noted that a person under 18 who committed an act in Baltimore City, which would be a crime not punishable by death or life imprisonment if committed by adult, was within the original exclusive jurisdiction of the Baltimore City court. Since the case was not final on 15 May 1969, and pursuant to Baltimore, Md. City Code art. 4, &sect;&sect; 240(d) and 241, the court concluded that the juvenile court had original, exclusive jurisdiction over defendant as to the robbery charges. The court accordingly reasoned that the trial court had neither the right nor the power to try defendant on the robbery charges absent an effective waiver of jurisdiction by the juvenile court. The court concluded that the juvenile court had no jurisdiction of defendant on the murder charge because murder was a crime punishable by death or life imprisonment if committed by adult.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the application on the murder conviction and affirmed the denial of the petition on that judgment. The case was remanded for further proceedings on the robbery charges in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee appealed the order of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) that granted summary judgment to defendant self-insured employer in the employee's claim for workers' disability benefits that had been denied by the Workmen's Compensation Commission of Maryland because of the statutory bar of Md. Code art. 101, &sect; 39(a). The employee also appealed the denial of his motion for a rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee, a firefighter, argued that he did not realize at the time of the accident that he had been injured, that his injury was latent, and that he did not become aware of it until he became disabled, some two years and eight months after the injury to which he attributed his disability. Rejecting the employee's pre-1957 amendment supporting cases, the court held that the requirements of Md. Ann. Code art. 101, &sect; 39(a) required that the employee file a claim within two years of the date of the industrial accident, and not the date of disability or discovery of a previously latent condition. Accordingly, both the Commission and the trial court correctly applied the law in ruling that the employee's claim, filed more than two years after his alleged accident, was barred. Likewise, the court rejected the employee's contention, raised for the first time in his motion for rehearing, that the application of the plain words of the statute was an unconstitutional denial of due process and equal protection of laws because no evidence was introduced on the issue, and the argument was not developed through the adversary process which was required for a proper determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, and ordered the employee to pay costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to murder and rape. Prior to the sentencing hearing, defendant wrote to the trial judge and indicated that he wanted to withdraw his guilty plea because he was not guilty and had only pleaded guilty under the advice of his attorneys, who told him that he might escape the death penalty. Defendant also wrote that he was not told that the death penalty was going to soon be brought up for abolishment. However, the court affirmed the judgments. Only the rape sentence was vacated and remanded, and that was because the trial judge did not ensure that the sentence, which included defendant paying 40 percent of his earnings to the children of the victim, had a rational basis. The murder and rape convictions were affirmed because the fact that the death penalty was &quot;up for abolishment&quot; did not compel a finding that the guilty plea was not entered into voluntarily and intelligently. In fact, the trial judge had painstakingly advised defendant of the constitutional rights he was foregoing and the possible consequences flowing from the pleas. Defendant was still free to pursue his ineffective assistance of counsel issue through appropriate post-conviction proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were incarcerated in the state prison when they participated in a prison disorder. Defendants were indicted for assault, riot, and malicious destruction. Defendants' motions for removal were denied, and they were convicted of the charged offenses. Defendants appealed. The court affirmed, holding that Md. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8 did not make invidious distinctions between removal in capital and non-capital criminal offenses. The distinction served as a means of preventing an abuse of removal and facilitated and reduced expense in the administration of criminal justice. Defendants did not successfully demonstrate that the pretrial publicity was of such intensity that it permeated the community to the extent that they were denied their right to a fair and impartial jury trial as mandated by both U.S. Const. amend. VI and Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 21. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying removal on the ground of racial prejudice. The Intrastate Detainer Act, Md. Ann.

The court held that the trial court did not err denying the inmate credit against his sentence for the time he spent on probation in the community because, when the inmate's probation was revoked, and the suspension of the previously imposed sentence was stricken, the inmate's sentence went into effect exactly as it was originally imposed, and the trial court could not modify that sentence by allowing credit for time the inmate spent in the community on probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted on a jury verdict that contained no limitation as to the imposition of the death sentence. The gist of defendant's contention was that, pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect;&sect; 461, 463, if a jury after a rape trial rendered a verdict that included the words &quot;without capital punishment,&quot; the trial court could not impose any sentence greater than 20 years for the offense. He argued that, because in the period between the rendition of the verdict and his motion for postconviction relief the death penalty had been ruled unconstitutional, capital punishment was not an issue, so that the maximum sentence was 20 years, not life. In denying the application for review, the court held that life imprisonment was a sentencing option unaffected by the ruling regarding the death penalty. The court rejected other grounds for relief from the conviction, noting that the sufficiency of the evidence was an issue cognizable on direct appeal only, and that counsel had not rendered ineffective assistance and the prosecution had not suppressed Brady material in relation to an agreement not to tell the jury that defendant had syphilis.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he raised eight issues, one of which was the failure to suppress inculpatory evidence unconstitutionally seized from his automobile.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Acting on a radio dispatch, a policeman familiar with defendant and his activities stopped him driving his car and arrested him. The car was taken to a police station and searched pursuant to a warrant. On appeal, the court held that the search was constitutional by virtue of the warrant and it was constitutional based on probable cause and exigent circumstances even without one. Defendant's conviction on the receiving charge was not fatally defective; the value of the goods stolen was not a necessary element of the offense but only determined whether it was a felony or a misdemeanor. The court freed defendant of any collateral disabilities resulting from a felony designation. He did not raise the issue of genuine and effective representation in the lower court. But, the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for keeping an automobile as a common nuisance for the purpose of keeping or selling narcotic drugs in violation of Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 286(a)(5) and his sentence for possessing controlled paraphernalia exceeded the maximum provided by Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 287(e). His other issues had no merit.

The passenger claimed that the action was timely because the amendment to &sect; 112 became effective after the accident and before the administrator qualified, which made the action timely. The trial court ruled that the version of &sect; 112 as it existed at the time of the accident applied and awarded partial summary judgment to the administrator. The first appeal by the passenger and motorist was dismissed as premature. At trial, a directed verdict was awarded to the administrator. The passenger and motorist appealed, and the court vacated the trial court's decision. Section 112 created a liability that did not exist in common law. The administrator was an original party. Therefore, it was the form of &sect; 112 that existed at the date of the administrator's qualification that controlled because that was the first date upon which service was possible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the trial court's order that had granted summary judgment to the administrator. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved to suppress the contents of the box but the trial court admitted them under the &quot;plain view&quot; exception. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The court noted that the officers had a right to be in the hallway and to see whatever could be seen from that vantage point. However, the they did not have a right to intrude into defendant's room and court held that the &quot;plain view&quot; doctrine was inapplicable. Although the objects were in &quot;open view&quot; and provided the officers with probable cause to believe that they were stolen goods, the court found that insufficient to justify the warrantless seizure.

The court held that there was no grounds for the granting of the writ because the ex-husband was not in any manner in default upon his alimony obligations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney worked for the state as a prosecutor. The attorney told a journalist that a prosecutor in a pending criminal case had fabricated arson charges and that the indictment was &quot;phony.&quot; The criminal case had already been removed due to publicity. The trial court had also issued an order prohibiting counsel from making statements that were, or tended to be, prejudicial to the case. After the attorney's statements were published in a newspaper, the trial court found the attorney guilty of contempt of court for violating the order. On appeal, the court ruled that the trial court had the discretion to proscribe matters which threatened the fairness of the trial. The court further held that no pre-issuance evidentiary hearing was needed to exercise this power. The court concluded that there was no requirement that the attorney actually prejudice the criminal trial, rather, the threat of prejudice was sufficient to justify the order. The court ruled that the trial court properly found that there was sufficient evidence to show that the attorney had wilfully attempted to prejudice a fair trial.

Defendant alleged numerous errors by the trial court, all of which were dismissed by the court. Defendant claimed the grand jury indicted him because of pre-trial publicity but the court held there was no requirement that the grand jury be unprejudiced. The court held there was no error in refusing defendant a private trial because the ability to waive a constitutional right did not ordinarily carry with it the right to insist upon the opposite of that right. Further, there was no error in introducing evidence of a prior act against the victim because the act was of the same type of which the defendant was accused. The court also held there was no error in failing to disclose the victim's psychiatric record because the privilege of non-disclosure was facially constitutional. The court noted that there was no good or sufficient reason to conclude that a video transmittal of the accused's conduct brought about by the cooperation of the victim should be interpreted as constituting an unreasonable seizure in violation of the defendant's justifiable expectation of privacy.</SPAN></P>

The court reviewed the legislative history of the statute, and concluded that it was clearly limited to those who made the representations f to induce another to purchase or sell property. Because the representations were an integral part of the unlawful conduct, they were not subject to First Amendment protection.

The court found that the refusal of defendants to testify before the grand jury did not constitute a direct contempt of court. Any contempt would have been constructive rather than direct.

The court found that as defendant failed to object to the trial court's instructions to the jury, he failed to preserve any error therein for appellate review, and even so, the trial court's advisory instructions, when read as a whole, clearly and concisely set forth the applicable law regarding the three possible verdicts: guilty of murder in the second degree; guilty of manslaughter; and not guilty.

The wife moved back home, but the husband moved out, lived with another woman, and worked. The husband filed an action against the wife for a divorce under Md. Ann. Code art. 16, &sect; 24. The wife denied the five-year separation and filed a cross-bill for separate maintenance, alimony, and counsel fees because the husband deserted her. The trial court granted the husband a divorce and denied the wife's cross-bill upon the advice of the Master for Domestic Relations Causes (master). The court vacated the divorce decree, denied the husband's motion to dismiss the appeal, and remanded. The court held that because there was an &quot;actual contest&quot; regarding the divorce, as evidenced by the wife's denial and her cross-bill for separate maintenance, the master did not have jurisdiction under Rule S 80.b of the Seventh Judicial Circuit to hear the divorce action. The court held that the wife was entitled to alimony and counsel fees under Md. Ann. Code art. 16, &sect;&sect; 3, 5 because she did not have sufficient income to provide for herself or to pay for her counsel fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with drug-related offenses for two separate indictments. Defendant, on his own initiative, sought to make a deal for himself by offering information to the State in exchange for some form of leniency. Defendant arranged a meeting with the prosecution. The testimony was utterly chaotic as to the nature of any agreement that could have come out of the meeting. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that defendant, by his actions seeking a deal with the State, waived his right to a speedy trial. The waiver was not by mere inaction, from which position of disadvantage defendant could redeem himself by a showing of actual prejudice coupled with a showing of undue delaying tactics or bad faith by the State. The fact that the prosecution did not honor their alleged bargain was not unconstitutional. Whatever bargain a defendant could strike for himself in the prosecutorial marketplace, he possessed no constitutional right to have immunity conferred upon him. Even if defendant had immunity, he could only have immunity for incidents he testified about. His convictions were for separate offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An indictment was filed accusing defendant of breaking a dwelling house with intent to steal. A personal recognizance was filed and the same day counsel was appointed to represent defendant. The warrant was recalled by the State and no further legal proceedings were taken at the time. The warrant was reactivated and defendant was arrested. The grand jury indicted him on the charge. He claimed denial of due process and denial of a speedy trial. The court vacated and remanded defendant's conviction. The court held that the right to a speedy trial attached when a prosecution was initiated. The burden was on defendant to demonstrate violation of due process. He had to show actual prejudice to the conduct of the defense and that the prosecution intentionally delayed to gain some tactical advantage over him or to harass him. Four factors were used to determine if defendant's right to a speedy trial had been violated: the length of the delay; the reason for the delay; prejudice to defendant; and whether defendant waived his right to a speedy trial. The record was not complete enough for the court to make an independent constitutional appraisal.</SPAN></P>

Sentences of life imprisonment for the murder and of ten years for the robbery, consecutive to the life sentence, were imposed. On appeal, defendant argued that when a jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree, without any qualifying words, the trial judge could impose a lesser sentence such as a term of years. He further argued that when a jury added to its verdict words indicating that leniency should be shown, the judge had no alternative but to impose a life sentence, which was a denial of the right to equal protection of the laws. The court found that the legislature in prescribing the penalty for first degree murder did not intend to prescribe a maximum and a minimum, which would contemplate a range in between, but intended to prescribe two alternative penalties, each fixed by the legislature itself, without committing to the trial judge any discretion except a choice between the two, with that choice available only when not precluded by the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was the object of police scrutiny and when he left a dance hall he was followed. A police officer stopped defendant's vehicle. Defendant got outside of his vehicle and conversed with the police officer at the rear of defendant's vehicle. When the police officer went back to his police cruiser, a detective who was secretly watching the incident using binoculars spotted defendant deposit some items to the ground. Another detective located four aluminum foils deposited on the ground and picked them up. A government chemist later identified the foils' contents as heroin. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in not suppressing the evidence at a suppression hearing conducted outside of the jury's presence. On appeal, the court held that Md. R. 729 set forth the procedure for determining either before or at trial the admissibility of evidence claimed to have been obtained by an unlawful search or seizure. The action of defendant in disposing of the property before its seizure was the result of his own voluntary choice and not forced by the actions of the officers. The seizure was lawful.

The court held that, on the facts of this case, the refusal to grant the mistrial was an abuse of discretion and that defendant was denied a fair and impartial trial. The introduction of the notion of homosexuality, especially on the part of an elementary school principal vis-a-vis &quot;boys&quot; or &quot;young boys,&quot; added a totally foreign consideration to the case.

He was tried in the criminal court, found guilty, and sentenced to one year. His trial under adult procedures was by virtue of the exception contained in Md. Ann. Code art. 26, &sect; 70-1(c), which was declared unconstitutional. Because defendant was entitled to the benefit of the ruling declaring the exception unconstitutional, he was brought before a master assigned to conduct proceedings in juvenile cases. The master waived jurisdiction. Defendant excepted and was returned to the juvenile facility. Defendant was again arrested and the juvenile court waived jurisdiction and held him over for adult proceedings. The court reversed and remanded the juvenile court's decision. The court held that the waiver was under Md. Ann. Code art. 26, &sect; 54, and it could not serve as the basis for a waiver after summary review within the contemplation of the new Md. Ann. Code art. 26, &sect; 70-16. The function of the waiver hearing was to resolve the question of waiver vel non, and the State had no burden at the hearing to establish prima facie or otherwise corpus delicit and criminal agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Criminal Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which after a jury trial convicted him of disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct, suspended his 90-day sentence, and released him on one year's probation upon payment of fines and court costs. He claimed that Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect;&sect; 121, 123, were unconstitutional, that there was a merger of offenses, and that it was error to deny motions for acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant incited a crowd at a large public event to disobey the police, threw objects, and shouted obscenities at police officers. At trial, officers testified that he was at the event for at several hours, and witnesses testifying on his behalf claimed that he was there for much less time. On review, the court found that he had not raised the issue of the constitutionality of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect;&sect; 121, 123, at trial so it was not before the court and that to the extent it was raised upon his motion for a new trial, the denial of that motion was not properly before the court. The court found that evidence of witnesses on defendant's reputation for truth and veracity was not relevant to demonstrate that it was unlikely he would commit the charged crimes and that it was not error to not give an instruction on character. The court ruled that the gist of disorderly conduct was the doing or saying of that which offended, disturbed, incited, or tended to incite a number of people gathered in an area, that the jury could conclude his acts violated &sect; 123, that the offenses did not merge, and that a conviction on one count need not be vacated because of an inconsistent acquittal.</SPAN></P>

He tried to secure the door but he could not close it against the force of those attempting to gain entrance. About 40 or 50 persons entered the lobby. Reinforcements called by the policeman arrived and in about 20 minutes the lobby had been cleared. There were judicial identifications of defendant as one of those in the building changing lettering on a directory board and that he kept on doing so when requested to leave. Defendant was convicted of the common law crime of forcible entry and a statutory crime, sentenced, and sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that in considering whether a law was unconstitutionally vague all that was required was that the language conveyed sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court convicted defendant for unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance, marijuana, in sufficient quantity to reasonably indicate under all the circumstances and intent to manufacture and distribute such controlled dangerous substance in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 286(a)(1). On appeal, the court stated that it was an established doctrine of constitutional law that a penal statute must set forth a reasonably ascertainable standard of guilt. The court held that the words of &sect; 286(a)(1) fixed an ascertainable standard of guilt and were not so vague as to leave a person of ordinary intelligence in doubt as to the nature of the acts condemned. Thus, the statute met the requirement of due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and was constitutional. Further, the court held that defendant's plea of guilty was a conviction of the highest order. It waived all defenses she may have had, even constitutional ones, except lack of jurisdiction of the court to try her for the offense charged. The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was entitled to a determination of constitutionality only of those provisions of the Act under which he was convicted. The court's inquiry was as to the constitutionality vel non of the legislature declaring it a crime for a person who had no lawful business to pursue at public educational institutions of the state to refuse or fail to leave the buildings or grounds of the institution after being requested to do so by an authorized employee. The court found that the provisions were neither unconstitutionally vague as to the standards imposed nor unconstitutionally broad as to applying to constitutionally protected conduct so as to violate due process of law. The language conveyed sufficiently definite warning as to what conduct was proscribed when measured by common understanding and practices.

Upon entering the house, the police informed defendant of the warrant and placed defendant under arrest. They then commenced a search of the house. On review, defendant contended that the warrantless search of his room was unconstitutional; hence, the items obtained from that search were inadmissible. The court noted that the mother, the lessee of the entire house, had given permission to the officers to search her home. The court further noted that there was authority to the effect that a parent could consent to a search of a child's living quarters if the child was living at home. As there was no indication that the consent of the mother was other than freely, intelligently, specifically, and unequivocally given, the search was valid and the items obtained as a result of the search were admissible.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim claimed that defendant and eight other members of a motorcycle club abducted and sexually assaulted her over several days. The court partially affirmed, reversed, and vacated defendant's convictions. There was sufficient evidence to support the convictions because any inconsistencies in the victim's testimony went only to credibility and did not preclude its consideration. Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 337 (1957), which governed forcible carrying of a victim within or out of the state, was constitutional because it did not apply to a kidnapping committed in another state, as defendant contended. The court merged the false imprisonment conviction, however, into the kidnapping conviction because false imprisonment was a necessary element to kidnapping. The court refused to merge the assault conviction into the kidnapping conviction because defendant committed independent assaults, which were separate and distinct offenses from those included in the kidnapping. Defendant could not be convicted both of forcibly carrying both out of and within the state, so that judgment was set aside. Section 337 was enacted to distinguish forcible carrying from common law kidnapping.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. Article 27, &sect;577A(1) set forth the forbidden conduct and specifically described the warning to leave. The statute did not violate due process of law for vagueness. The statute did not invite arbitrary enforcement nor did it make selective enforcement inevitable. It was constitutional on its face. There was nothing unconstitutional in the manner in which the statute was applied. Each warrant was sufficient to charge an offense and was sufficiently informative to put the accused on notice of the particular act. The lower court did not err in denying motions to dismiss the warrants or for judgment of acquittal. The jury instructions explained reasonable doubt in terms of very important matters in the jurors' lives. The court could not say that the instructions clearly could have convicted on a preponderance of the evidence. The court found no clear error. The evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that none of defendants had lawful business to pursue at the time of arrest.</SPAN></P>

Defendant one argued that there was a fatal variance between the indictment charging larceny from an unincorporated business and the proof establishing larceny from a corporation and defendant two argued, inter alia, that the continuing larceny theory violated their right to be free from double jeopardy. The court affirmed the convictions. During defendants' first trial on the charges, the indictment was amended to removed the words &quot;a body corporate&quot; that followed the bank name. In the second trial, evidence was presented that the bank was a corporation. The court found that name given for the bank in the amended indictment corresponded precisely to the formal, legal title of the bank. Defendant was informed of the exact accusation against him and the proof substantiated that accusation beyond reasonable doubt. The court also held that the act of crossing state lines with the money taken from the bank constituted a larceny under state law.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 66 &amp; 1/2, &sect; 232.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal from a conviction for failure to yield the right-of-way in a trial court, the lower court dismissed the charge, finding that the statute under which defendant had been convicted did not exist because it had been repealed by a new statute that was not effective until after the date of the offense. On appeal from the lower court's decision to dismiss, the State argued that the old law was effective up until the time that the new statute became effective. Defendant argued that the failure to expressly provide that the old statute was not repealed until the effective date of the new statute was error and that the court had no power to correct this omission. The court agreed with the State. The court found that the legislature had not intended to repeal the former statute and leave the State without a motor vehicle code until the new statute became effective six months later. The court pointed out that the new statute contained many references that explicitly stated or implicitly indicated that the former statute remained in effect until the effective date of the new statute. Thus, the legislature was not silent as to the effective date of the repeal of the former statute.</SPAN></P>

He stated he did not deny pulling the trigger. Defendant testified that it was possible that he fired all three shots.

VIII and XIV had been denied. The court held that no right of appeal existed under Maryland law from the denial of the accused's habeas corpus petition. The court rejected the holding of an unreported case in which it was found that an amendment to the Post Conviction Procedure Act, Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 645A(e) (1967), had the affirmative effect of authorizing appeals in habeas corpus cases in those instances where the purpose of the petition was other than to challenge the legality of a conviction. The court found that by the amendment, the legislature simply intended to leave no doubt of its intention to preserve the narrow right of appeal in habeas corpus cases under Md. Ann.

Its dominant character was polemic, not prurient. Not even the theme of a cartoon appealed to the prurient interest of the average person. The state failed to make a prima facie showing of any community standard. The court held that not even the cartoon, far less the entire newspaper, was utterly devoid of redeeming social value. Nor was there any evidence, whatsoever, of pandering. The court did not feel that the material was hard-core pornography. Even were the material obscene by any test, however, the conviction of defendant would have to have been reversed because of the utter failure of the state to show any evidence of scienter on his part.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Criminal Court of Baltimore City (Maryland) for storehouse breaking and stealing merchandise of the value of $ 5 or more.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that, because he was 16 years old at the time of the commission of the crime, exclusive jurisdiction was vested in the Juvenile Court under Md. Ann. Code, art. 26, &sect;&sect; 51-101, in the absence of waiver of jurisdiction by the Juvenile Court, Md. Ann. Code art. 26, &sect; 70-16. On appeal, the court held that Md. Ann. Code, art. 26, &sect; 70-1(c) was invalid in so far as it treated 16 and 17 year old children differently. The court found that there was no legitimate reason for distinguishing between 16-year-old children and 17-year-old children. The court ruled that the effect of its decision would not be retroactive to cases finally decided on May 15, 1969. The court reasoned that full retroactivity was unnecessary because the harm had already been done to the persons who were adversely affected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded that case for a hearing before the Juvenile Court for a determination of whether that court waived jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother died from injuries received while a passenger in an automobile negligently driven by her unemancipated minor daughter. On appeal of the judgment in favor of the daughter, the father suggested that the court depart from the parent-child immunity doctrine. The court held that the lower court did not err in sustaining appellee's demurrer without leave to amend. Specifically, the court addressed the question of whether the daughter could be held answerable to her mother for injuries caused by her negligence. The court determined that the rule was firmly enough embedded in Maryland law as to make inadvisable its abolition by judicial decision. Moreover, the court held that the rule that a minor unemancipated child was not answerable to its parent for injuries caused by the child's negligence was not proscribed by either the Maryland Declaration of Rights or the U.S. Constitution. As the rule granted immunity to all unemancipated minor children as a class and applied to all parents of such children, there was no consideration of inequality that would have violated the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the conspiracy charge was adequate. The court found that there was no doubt that defendants knew that they were charged with conspiracy, the predicate of which was the commission of daytime housebreaking in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 30(b) (1967 Repl. Vol.). The court ruled that the search of the automobile was clearly not unconstitutional. The court determined that the fact finder could reasonably have inferred that one of defendants did not have the owner's consent to be on the property. The court found that the inference that defendants were acting pursuant to a prearranged design to break into the house and steal therefrom was not unreasonable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband deserted his wife. Later, the legislature sought to amend Md. Ann. Code art. 16, &sect; 24 by adding as a ground for divorce the failure of a couple to cohabitate for a period of time. The bill was amended to provide for a property division but the bill's title did not reflect the amendment. The amendment was enacted into law as 1969 Md. Laws Ch. 56. The law had an effective date that was after the separation began but before the suit for divorce was filed. The husband then filed for divorce. The wife demurred. The trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. The husband amended his petition, and the trial court overruled the wife's new demurrer and granted the divorce. The court affirmed the grant of divorce. The court held that the portion of the amended statute pertaining to property division was indeed unconstitutional because its title did not reflect the topic of property division. However, the defective title did not render the entire law unconstitutional. The fact that the separation began before the law's effective date did not make its application retrospective.

The court held that the constitutional challenge to the statute constituted a defense or objection under Md.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgments of the trial court.

The court found that the application for the search warrant was 15 typewritten pages in length, contained detailed information, and was signed and sworn to by three officers of the Maryland state police. The court concluded that the information provided by an informer's tip was substantially corroborated by independent police work so that the search warrant was validly obtained and that the evidence seized thereunder was properly admitted at trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the convictions. Regarding the rape, he claimed that given the conduct of the prosecutrix, the rape conviction was erroneous as a matter of law. Defendant asserted that he had paid a man to have intercourse with the prosecutrix. It was alleged that after defendant broke into her apartment, he forced her to have sex. A neighbor allegedly heard the prosecutrix scream, called the prosecutrix, and the prosecutrix asked her to call the police. Before the police arrived, defendant and prosecutrix went to defendant's apartment, where he filmed her in various sexual acts. The police arrived, but were not allowed into the apartment. The prosecutrix claimed that she participated in the acts because she feared for her safety. The police were notified the next day. Defendant argued that the prosecutrix consented, or she would have called the police into his apartment. The court found there was sufficient evidence to show that the prosecutrix did not know the police were at the door until they had left. The conviction for photographing obscene matter was improper, as the prosecutrix was not shown in the pictures at issue, and no evidence supported when they were taken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions were affirmed, except for his conviction of photographing obscene pictures. That conviction was reversed, and defendant was acquitted of that charge.</SPAN></P>

The officer requested that defendant show him his license and registration. The officer checked the license and determined that there was an outstanding arrest warrant for an individual with the same name who matched defendant's description. Defendant was placed under arrest. The officer then saw two brown envelopes on the front seat. He discovered capsules and a leafy substance. It was later discovered that the arrest warrant was not for defendant. Defendant was convicted. He claimed that the evidence found in the envelopes should not have been admitted because they were unconstitutionally seized. In reversing the conviction and remanding, the court found that the State did not establish with specificity why the brown envelopes were recognized by the officer as the type commonly used for narcotic drugs. The officer did not state the basis for his conclusion, and he did not establish his expertise in such field to make such conclusion. There was nothing before the trial judge to permit him to intelligently assess whether the officer's belief had a factual basis amounting to probable cause in the constitutional context.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and blasphemy. He filed a post conviction petition contesting his conviction for blasphemy. The trial court found the blasphemy statute to be unconstitutional and set aside defendant's conviction and sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed, ruling that Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect;20 was unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The court noted that the statute made it a crime to blaspheme or curse God orally or in writing, or to &quot;write or utter profane words of and concerning our Saviour Jesus Christ, or of and concerning the Trinity, or any person thereof,&quot; regardless of the setting or circumstances. The court found that the statute had no secular purpose, rejecting the state's argument that it was an effort to allow citizens to worship unmolested and to protect the public peace from persons outraged by the blasphemous utterances it prohibited. The court concluded that the statute unconstitutionally was intended to protect, preserve, and perpetuate the Christian religion, and was not limited to situations relating to preventing violence or breaches of the peace, or preserving order or the right to worship.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court denied his motion for a new trial, defendant appealed. The court affirmed. The case did not fall within the exception to the rule that a denial of a motion for a new trial was not appealable. There was no abuse of judicial discretion in the denial of the motion. As the evidence was satisfactory to the trial court, it was within its province to refuse to grant a new trial. The trial court did not feel that the verdict was unsupported by any evidence. The trial court did not feel that there was such a preponderance of proof on the side of defendant as to show that manifest injustice had been done by the verdict, which would have warranted a conclusion that the jury had been mistaken or had failed to weigh the evidence properly or to apply legal principles. Suspicion of corruption, prejudice, or partiality on the part of the jury was not shown. The trial court did not conclude that there was a defect of substantial justice at the trial or that a new trial was required in the interest of justice. The weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses were matters for the jury.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's assertions were without merit. The court held that the trial court did not improperly fail to grant a bifurcated trial because, as a matter of law, defendant was not entitled to separate trials on the issues of insanity or not guilty. If he wished to cite conduct at the time of the crime to support an insanity plea, he was required to admit the facts that were to prove his insanity. Regarding the indictment, defendant asserted that Md. Ann. Code art. 51 &sect; 1, and Md. Ann. Code art. 51 &sect; 9 were unconstitutional due to the qualifications of age, intelligence, sobriety, and integrity that was required of persons to participate in a grand jury panel.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant took the stand to testify. During the State's cross-examination, he was questioned about his prior criminal convictions. Defendant's counsel made timely objections to the questioning, but the trial judge overruled. On appeal, defendant asserted that the questions should not have been allowed because he was not afforded the assistance of counsel during the proceedings related to the prior convictions, and he had not waived his right to counsel in those proceedings. The court held that evidence of a prior conviction, when such conviction was unconstitutionally obtained by the denial of counsel, was required to be excluded. However, because the trial judge disposed of the objections summarily, the court was without evidence of whether defendant's constitutional right to counsel had been violated. Thus, the court determined that further proceedings were necessary in the trial court to determine whether the impeachment evidence against defendant should have been admitted. Additionally, the court held that a search of defendant's automobile did not produce inadmissible evidence because the search fell within the vehicle exception to the search warrant requirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Criminal Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which convicted defendant of robbery with a deadly weapon of a bank.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The primary issue in defendant's trial was the identity of the robber. One witness to the crime at first did not identify defendant in court as the one he saw at the crime scene. However, when recalled the next day over defendant's objection, the witness testified that he had not identified defendant due to threats against his family, but with assurances of police protection, he then identified defendant. The court held that recalling the witness under the circumstances was not an abuse of the trial court's discretion, so long as the defense counsel had full opportunity to cross-examine the witness as to the changes in his testimony subsequent to his first appearance in court. Any discrepancies in the testimony or reasons to doubt the credibility of the witness due to a threatened perjury prosecution were for the jury to resolve. Nor was it an error to permit that witness to see defendant in handcuffs in the courtroom. Therefore, allowing the witness's in-court identification was not reversible error. The court held that based on that testimony, and the testimony of a confederate who helped defendant plan the robbery, the jury could reasonably conclude that defendant was guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police used a confidential informer to make a &quot;buy&quot; of cocaine from defendant, who operated a barbershop and was under suspicion of dealing drugs. Defendant was convicted of having under his control the narcotic drug cocaine after the trial court refused to compel the state to disclose the identity of the informer. The court reversed defendant's conviction and held that the trial court abused its discretion by not compelling disclosure of the informer's identity. In finding defendant guilty, the trial court considered the evidence of the informer's activities. The exception to the state's privilege of nondisclosure of the identity of the informer applied to the issue of guilt or innocence as distinguished from the issue of probable cause for a warrantless arrest or a warrantless search. The evidence provided by the informer tended directly to prove the crime charged, and that the crime and the activities of prior days were sufficiently linked together. Defendant properly invoked this exception to the state's privilege of nondisclosure. Defendant's right to a fair defense outweighed the public interest in protecting the flow of information to the police.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Circuit Court for Cecil County (Maryland) for the unauthorized use of a motorcycle. Originally defendant was charged with the grand larceny of a motorcycle, count 1, and the unauthorized use of it, count 2. Upon rearraignment, the state entered a nolle prosequi to the first count without objection, and defendant pleaded guilty to the second count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant stated that the only reason he took the motorcycle was to take it to the police because it was lying in a ditch. The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded for a new trial. The court held that the trial court erred in accepting the guilty plea. At the time the plea was accepted, defendant's version was all the trial court had before it and on such a version defendant did not have the requisite intent to deprive the motorcycle's owner of its use. If defendant thought he was guilty on such facts and circumstances, it was only because he did not have an intelligent understanding of the nature of the offense. The court found that although the trial court's inquiry clearly showed that the guilty plea was voluntary in the traditional sense as not the result of coercion, threats, or inducements and that it was made with an intelligent understanding of the possible consequences, the recounting by defendant of his acts were insufficient to constitute the charged offense. Whether the state at trial could have contradicted, disputed, or refuted defendant's version or whether the trier court would have found defendant not credible was not the issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which entered a nolle prosequi to the first count of grand larceny of a motorcycle and convicted defendant for the unauthorized use of the motorcycle, and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed judgments of the Criminal Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which convicted him of shoplifting and assault with intent to murder. The items were stolen from a store, and defendant had fired a gun toward a store employee when the store employees attempted to apprehend defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued, among other things, that the evidence did not establish the ownership of the stolen items or an intent to murder. The court held that the evidence and testimony of the store employees sufficiently proved the corporate nature of the store, which owned the stolen items. The admission of photographs of the stolen items did not violate the best evidence rule because the rule only applied to writings. Based on descriptions given by store employees, police officers had probable cause to arrest and search defendant without a warrant. There was sufficient evidence that defendant fired a gun at a store employee without justification. Defendant's firing of the gun was not the result of a passion or sufficient provocation directly resultant from an alleged illegal arrest by the store employees, who were chasing defendant. Defendant's use of deadly force inferred malice. Finally, the store employees' identifications were not tainted by the fact that one of the store employees had told the others that he had previously identified defendant from a photograph. The store employees had ample opportunity to observe defendant during prior to his arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was found guilty of control of heroin. His apprehension by a bail bondsman was deemed legal under the common law right of the bail bondsman to arrest the principal upon forfeiture of the bond. Appellant conceded that there was clearly sufficient evidence to convict him for possession of narcotic implements but claimed that there was not sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction of control of narcotics since only trace amounts of narcotics were found. The court held that there needed to be only a sufficient quantity to make a proper determination that it was a narcotic drug. The court found that appellant voluntarily committed the crimes for which he was convicted, rejecting his defenses under the doctrines of entrapment, duress, and necessity, because necessity was not available in a prosecution for an offense not requiring intent, and no compelling force of the nature required for duress existed.</SPAN></P>

The matter was appealed up to the United States Supreme Court, which found that a larceny conviction violated defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy. The Supreme Court then remanded the burglary conviction to the court for the court to determine whether the burglary conviction was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was tried on a burglary count and found guilty of burglary, a violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 30(a). At the same time, defendant was tried and found guilty of common law larceny. The Supreme Court found that the larceny conviction violated defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy, but it remanded the burglary conviction to the court to determine whether evidence that was admissible in the larceny trial but not admissible in the burglary trial tainted defendant's burglary conviction. At trial there was evidence that defendant took household appliances from a dwelling that he broke into. On remand, the burglary conviction was reinstated. The court held that breaking into a dwelling house with the intent to steal constituted burglary and that larceny involved the theft of goods. Thus, felonious intent to steal was an essential element of the crime of burglary under &sect; 30(a), and proof of larceny was the best proof of defendant's intent to steal. Therefore, the proof that defendant took appliances from the dwelling was relevant to both the larceny and the burglary counts, and the jury was not prejudiced by the evidence that defendant committed larceny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate sought relief under post conviction procedures, which was denied by the criminal court. The court denied the inmate's application to appeal. The inmate's petition for relief alleged that he was denied the right to counsel during interrogation, his arrest was illegal, and the indictments were null and void under Schowgurow v. State, which held that a requirement of a belief in God as qualification for jury service, or an oath as to such belief, or inquiry of such belief of prospective jurors, was unconstitutional. The inmate's convictions had not become final before Schowgurow; direct appeal was still available to him when Schowgurow was decided. Therefore, the legal principle enunciated in that decision was available to him. The inmate, however, was presumed to have waived the allegations of error under Md. R. BK48 and Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect;645A(c) because he could have made each allegation of error on direct appeal but, instead, had freely and intelligently decided not to file a direct appeal. The inmate failed to show special circumstances sufficient to rebut the presumption that he intelligently and knowingly failed to make the allegations of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was convicted of grand larceny and breaking and entering with intent to steal. The trial court denied his post-conviction petition, and in his application for leave to appeal, the inmate contended that the oath was unconstitutional, that the indictment was not a true bill, that his attorney failed to call witnesses on his behalf, and that the complaining witness perjured himself. The court noted that the inmate did not state to what oath he was referring, what part of it was unconstitutional, on what grounds it was unconstitutional, or to whom the oath applied. Thus, the contention was dismissed as a bald allegation. The court held that the inmate's objection based on a defect in the indictment should have been raised by motion before trial and was, therefore, waived under Md. R. 725(b). The court found that defense counsel's failure to call witnesses was either incompetency or a trial tactic and that neither constituted grounds for post-conviction relief. Finally, the fact that the complaining witness said that he had been given his name at birth, which was untrue, did not constitute perjury because the witness's birth name was not material to the inmate's rights.</SPAN></P>

The evidence clearly showed that defendant had in his possession a motor vehicle containing an engine which he admitted had been removed from another motor vehicle and that the number on the engine had been defaced. The trial court did not err in finding that the bead of weld had not been placed on the engine in connection with anything other than that it was intended to cover the lettering on the engine number. This permitted a proper inference that the number had been defaced to conceal or misrepresent the identity of the engine and the motor vehicle in which it had been placed.

Code art. 27, &sect; 298 placed an unconstitutional burden of proof upon him, and the charge of unlawful possession merged with unlawful control. The evidence showed that while defendant was at a dance, a plainclothes officer saw him drop a crumpled piece of tissue that contained a mixture of heroin and other substances. On appeal, the court found that at the beginning of trial, the presumption of innocence required the State to present a prima facie case. After the State made a prima facie case, defendant had the burden to produce sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. Defendant had to produce evidence sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether he was authorized to possess the narcotic in question. It was not unconstitutional to require him to do so. The court also found that the only control of narcotic drugs exercised by defendant was when he had them in his possession. A conviction of possession based upon physical possession precluded a conviction also for control based on the same possession.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment of acquittal on the charge of manslaughter based upon the verdict in the prior proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction for second-degree murder. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that testimony that defendant stabbed the victim in a vital part of his body was sufficient to show malice, a requisite element of second degree murder, and that contradictory testimony went to the weight, rather than the admissibility of such evidence. The court further held that the statutory inference of malice from such use of a deadly weapon was not an unconstitutional violation of the presumption of innocence, reasoning that the presumption merely provided rebuttable prima facie evidence of malice and, therefore, did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof of innocence to defendant. The court reasoned that the fact of malice was more likely than not to flow from the proof of the use of the weapon in question, and that the inference of malice was therefore neither arbitrary or irrational. The court held that defendant's objections to the trial court's jury instructions did not constitute plain error and, therefore, were waived because they were raised for the first time on appeal, noting in any event that the instructions were complete and correctly stated the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Application for leave to appeal from the Criminal Court of Baltimore; Jones, J.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Memorandum Opinion of the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Jones, J.):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner was convicted by Judge James A. Perrott in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, without a jury, of robbery with a deadly weapon, Indictment No. 5954/66, and assault with intent to murder, Indictment No. 5955/66, and on each was sentenced to ten years, to run concurrently.  The conviction and judgment were affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Robinson v. State</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, an unreported opinion filed May 2, 1968.  However, he had previously filed (on July 26, 1967) an application for review of sentence under Code, Art. 26, Sections 132-138, but the determination of the Sentence Review Panel was not made until June 27, 1968, shortly after the mandate of the Court of Special Appeals was handed down on June 2, 1968.  The Order of the Review Panel, consisting of Judges O'Donnell, Harris and Perrott, was that the ten year sentence under Indictment No. 5954 remain unchanged, but the sentence under Indictment No. 5955 was modified by being increased to fifteen years, dating from December 3, 1966 and running concurrently with the ten year&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sentence under Indictment No. 5954.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is from the action of the Review Panel that petitioner seeks post conviction relief, and under this, his first such petition, he was represented by privately retained counsel, Morris L. Kaplan, Esq., who was his trial counsel.  The State was represented by E. Garrison Neal, Assistant State's Attorney.  In his petition and at the hearing thereon, petitioner raised two contentions: (1) that the action of the Review Panel in increasing his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment and violated his constitutional rights; and (2) that the refusal of the Review Panel to honor his request to withdraw his application for review of sentence constituted a denial of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering the contentions in inverse order, petitioner testified at the post conviction hearing that he never did receive notice of the hearing before the Review Panel which was conducted on June 27, 1968.  He said that at the review hearing he filed a petition to withdraw his request for a sentence review and that he had intended to withdraw it for sometime, but was going to wait until he received notice of the hearing and then he was going to file his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  request for withdrawal.  He said he did not know he was coming to court (for the hearing) until he was taken from his cell that same morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the post conviction hearing Morris L. Kaplan, Esq., who was counsel for petitioner in the sentence review proceeding, testified that he did not receive formal notice of the hearing but learned on June 26, 1968 that it would be held the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State and petitioner's counsel in the present proceeding have filed with this court a stipulation that the records of Judge William J. O'Donnell (the chairman of the Sentence Review Panel) concerning the Application for Review of Sentence filed by petitioner on July 26, 1967 indicate that a copy of the memorandum to Judges Harris and Perrott from Judge O'Donnell advising them that the hearing on said application would be held on June 27, 1968 was mailed to petitioner at his place of detention on June 25, 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transcript of the hearing before the Review Panel shows that the request for withdrawal, filed at the beginning of the hearing, was vigorously argued by petitioner's counsel, who contended then, and still contends, that since notice of the hearing was not given to petitioner, he was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not bound by Maryland Rule 762, which reads in part as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;Rule 762. Review of Sentence.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;b. 5. Withdrawal of Application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;A convicted person may withdraw his application for review of a sentence at any time prior to receipt of notice of a hearing thereon, but not thereafter except by permission of the review panel.  A withdrawal shall be in writing, signed by the convicted person, and shall be filed with the clerk of the sentencing court.  An election to withdraw is final and shall terminate all rights of the convicted person to have the sentence reviewed under the Review of Criminal Sentences Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><BR><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is that the application for review was filed by petitioner on July 26, 1967 and he had ample time to withdraw his petition prior to the hearing which was eleven months later.  The further fact is that he was sent notice of the hearing and the petition for withdrawal was presented at the hearing itself.  It clearly was not timely filed under Rule 762 and the Review Panel was not in error in declining to accept it.  As a matter of further fact, petitioner's statement at the post conviction hearing that he intended to wait until he received the hearing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  notice and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">then</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> file his withdrawal is self-defeating, for this clearly would have been in violation of the Rule.  Petitioner's second contention is without merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to the contention that the increase in sentence from ten to fifteen years under Indictment No. 5955 constituted cruel and unusual punishment and violated petitioner's constitutional rights, the statute creating the review of sentence procedure, Art. 26, Sect. 134, clearly states that a sentence may be increased by the review panel.  Similar legislation has been held constitutional.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hicks v. Commonwealth</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 345 Mass. 89, 185 N.E.2d 739, cert. denied, 374 U.S. 839 (1963); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Konlfuss v.

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c13">1&nbsp;The fact that this Judge served on the Governor's Commission which filed this Report referred to was brought to the attention of petitioner's counsel with the suggestion that &quot;if petitioner and his counsel request that this proceeding be referred to another Judge&quot; that such request should be made prior to the scheduled hearing.  No such request was made and at the hearing no objection was raised to this court's hearing the matter.</SPAN></P>

State</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 250 Md. 468. In any event, the fifteen year sentence imposed by the Review Panel was within the statutory limit for assault with intent to murder.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed an application for relief under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act, which was denied. Defendant filed an application for leave to appeal that denial. The court denied the application and stated that it was for the reasons the trial court had published in its opinion. The court stated that Pearce did not apply retroactively and had no effect on defendant's application. The court stated that the action taken by the review panel was authorized by Md. Code art. 26, &sect;&sect; 132-138 and that defendant should have been aware of an increase in sentence.

However, the court concluded that no objection to the instructions was interposed by defendant, and the trial judge's erroneous instructions were not so material to the rights of defendant as to constitute reversible error. The court also held that defendant was deemed to have waived his right to a speedy trial because no demand was made, and defendant failed to show that he suffered actual prejudice, or even a strong possibility of prejudice. Finally, the court held that there was nothing in the record to support defendant's contention that the lower court abused its discretion in denying a change of venue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State of Maryland appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Allegany County (Maryland), which dismissed the State's appeal of a judgment of a trial magistrate acquitting defendants of driving while under the influence of liquor and intentionally spinning the wheels of a motor vehicle. The trial court held that Md. Ann. Code art. 5, &sect; 30 (1968 Supp.) did not authorize an appeal from a judgment of acquittal by a trial magistrate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court observed that the U.S. Supreme Court had held that the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy was applicable to and enforceable against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fifth Amendment protected against a second prosecution for the same criminal offense after acquittal by a tribunal competent to try the accused and therefore prohibited the government from securing a new trial by means of an appeal even if the acquittal was erroneous. The court observed that if it determined that &sect; 30 did authorize the State to appeal from a magistrate's acquittal of defendants, the statute would be plainly unconstitutional under the Supreme Court precedent cited. The court noted that it was not contended by the State that the trial magistrate did not have jurisdiction to try defendants, and it was clear that the offenses charged constituted violations of Maryland criminal law, each being a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment. The court held that the cited case changed Maryland law such that it prohibited legislation authorizing the State to appeal from a judgment of acquittal, and thus &sect; 30 was unconstitutional to the extent that it so authorized the State.</SPAN></P>

The officer making the request knew that the tag number of the car involved was the same as that of a car recently reported stolen and that the owner was coming to the station to reclaim it. The victims remained in the lobby for some time before they recognized defendant as he was about to enter the station. Defendant was convicted of indecent exposure and assault with intent to maim. He appealed, arguing that the extra-judicial identification was so unfair that it amounted to a denial of due process. The court affirmed, holding that the identification did not result from an impermissibly suggestive confrontation. Defendant was independently recognized and identified by the witnesses from among the many people who were in the police station; prior to the identification, the police did not know what defendant looked like, they were not positive that he would even appear, and the witnesses were simply requested to be present to ascertain if they could recognize anyone involved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant juvenile sought leave to appeal from a finding by the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Maryland) that he continued to be a defective delinquent. The juvenile was convicted of perverted practice and was then found to be a defective delinquent and committed to a state institution. An application for leave to appeal from that determination was denied. The redetermination came about after he filed a petition to have his status redetermined.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile contended that Md. Ann. Code art. 31B, &sect; 7 (1957) was unconstitutional in that &sect; 7(a) required that an examination for possible defective delinquency be made by three persons on behalf of the institution, but that &sect; 7(b) entitled a possible defective delinquent to be examined by only one practitioner of psychiatry of his own choice. The juvenile contended this denied him equal protection of the laws and due process of law. On appeal, the court first held that the finding of delinquency was not clearly erroneous. Although a physician who examined the juvenile at the juvenile's request stated that the juvenile no longer fit the description of a defective delinquent, the State's physicians, including the director of the institution where the juvenile was confined, disagreed. Such questions relating to the weight of the evidence were not available for review on an application for leave to appeal unless the finding was clearly erroneous. The court found that the statute had already been held to be constitutional, not only on its face but also in its interpretation, application, administration, and results. Thus, the juvenile's contentions had no merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The grounds for defendant's motion were that the State was precluded from prosecuting defendant by an order of another trial court, that defendant was denied a speedy trial, and that he was denied due process of law. The court affirmed. On March 4, 1966 the other trial court set aside apparent convictions for the indictments of which defendant complained and gave the State a reasonable time to refer the charges to a grand jury. The indictments were returned on December 19, 1967. On February 8, 1968, defendant applied for a writ of habeas corpus and was released from custody after the trial court hearing the habeas motion found no authority or commitments to hold him. However, the fact that defendant was found guilty of arson on June 11, 1964 and sentenced was not brought to the attention of the trial court hearing the habeas motion. The February 8, 1968 order provided no basis for dismissal of the indictments returned against defendant December 19, 1967. Whether a delay in an indictment violated due process depended on the circumstances of each case. Defendant failed to show prejudice by the delay, which was not so substantial as to establish prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested following a demonstration which had been directed against an African-American family living in a predominantly white neighborhood.

Defendant was convicted of acting in a disorderly manner and disturbing the peace in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 123. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's claim that &sect; 123 was unconstitutional. The court held that the evidence showed that the demonstration was calculated to stimulate and provoke interracial disorder and that an interracial confrontation so staged did not represent an orderly expression of ideas protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. The court further held that, although there was no evidence that defendant personally muttered any obscenities, shouted any insulting epithets, or uttered any &quot;fighting&quot; words during his participation in the march, the record clearly disclosed that he was an integral part of a disorderly group of persons espousing racial hatred and counseling violent action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of armed robbery by a jury. On appeal, he contended that he was denied due process of law by reason of the prosecutor's improper reference to a prior conviction for armed robbery which, at the time of the trial, was pending on appeal, and which subsequently was reversed. The court affirmed. Under the circumstances, the court found that the evidence of the prior conviction carried such force that it could in no event be deemed as harmless to the defense. The prior conviction, however, was not presumptively void on its face, but to the contrary was presumptively valid. It was not error to permit an attack upon the credibility of a witness by showing the fact of previous criminal conviction, even over objection that an appeal therefrom remained pending. The court held that where the prior conviction was not presumptively void at the time of its introduction in evidence, it did not constitute reversible error for the State to utilize it for impeachment purposes even though the prior conviction was subsequently reversed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were arrested and a search yielded untaxed cigarettes. They were convicted at a bench trial of possessing unstamped cigarettes in violation of &sect; 438. They appealed from that judgment, which was affirmed. The court found that there was probable cause for defendants' arrests as the officer had reason to believe that they were either transporting untaxed cigarettes without the requisite documents in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 455 or possessing untaxed cigarettes in violation of &sect; 438. In that regard, the officer was permitted to rely upon the informant's tip given his past reliability and the specificity of his information. Moreover, because defendants' arrests were lawful, the police were entitled to search the car and trailer as part of a search incident to arrest. The presumption created by Md. Ann.

It was only upon a finding that he was no longer a defective delinquent upon redetermination that the allowances applied. No allowances relating to good behavior and/or work could be considered in making the two-thirds calculation. Therefore, as defendant had not been confined for a total period equal to two-thirds of his original sentence, he was not entitled to file a petition for redetermination of his defective delinquency and the lower court did not err in denying it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the state entered a nolle prosequi of its first indictment against defendant, it filed three additional indictments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state filed four successive indictments against defendant. The state entered a nolle prosequi on the first indictment. Defendant contended that he been placed in jeopardy by the nolle prosequi entered as to the first indictment, that he had been denied a speedy trial, and that he was denied due process of law. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to dismiss the fourth indictment. The court held that defendant was not denied the right to a speedy trial. Defendant was not entitled to compel the state to make a choice between proceeding to trial on the first indictment or entering a &quot;not guilty confessed.&quot; The state had the right to enter the nolle prosequi, and because it was entered before trial had begun, its only effect was to finally determine that case. Because defendant could not be tried under the first indictment, he no longer had the right to a speedy trial with respect to it. Double jeopardy did not attach because there was no final verdict in the first indictment. Defendant's due process rights were not affected because the obtaining of four successive indictments was not oppressive or prejudicial to defendant.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendants challenged the competency of trial counsel and the advisory nature of the instructions of the trial court as to the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal the court reasoned that the matter of the incompetency of trial counsel was not tried and decided below; therefore it was not properly before the court. The court further held that because defendants failed to object to the jury instructions before the jury retired to consider its verdict, defendants could not assign as of right an alleged error in the jury instructions. Both defendants suggested plain error material to their rights in the trial court telling the jury that its instructions were advisory only. Defendants claimed that the presumption of innocence, the burden on the State to prove guilt, and that guilt must have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt were binding on the jury and could not have been disregarded by them. They urged that it was prejudicial error for the trial court to tell the jury that its instructions with respect to these matters were advisory only. The court rejecting this contention, holding that Md. R. Crim. P. 756b provided that the court should, in every case in which instructions were given to the jury, instruct the jury that they were the judges of the law and that the court's instructions were advisory only.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the case for the lower court to make findings of fact upon applicant's contentions concerning his confession and to determine whether the confession was freely and voluntarily made. The court determined that a finding at the trial in the underlying criminal case that applicant's confession was voluntary did not preclude him from raising the question in his first post conviction petition because it was not finally litigated under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect;645A(b). The court further determined that the lower court's conclusion that the confession was voluntary was not sufficient compliance with Md. Rule BK 45b. The court found that the lower court was not clearly erroneous in rejecting applicant's contentions that he was denied a fair and impartial trial and effective representation. The court also found that a jury was properly allowed to consider both the issue of sanity and the issue of guilt or innocence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant entered the restaurant and told the victim that defendant's organization needed funds, reminding the victim of another business that had been destroyed by a firebomb. A jury found defendant guilty of extortion and sentenced him to imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The evidence was sufficient in law to justify its submission to the jury. There was relevant evidence that could properly sustain the jury's conviction of defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant threatened the victim, the threat was verbal, the threat was to do injury to his person or property, and it was made with a view to extort money. It was for the jury to weigh the evidence and judge the credibility of the witnesses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants challenged the decision of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which convicted defendants of storehouse breaking, a violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 32; breaking and stealing to the value of $ 5 or more, a violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 33; and being rogues and vagabonds, a violation of Md. Ann.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendants contended that a tools were illegally seized, and therefore improperly admitted into evidence, and that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions. When defendants were stopped by police, one defendant was the passenger and a second defendant, the driver, told the police that he was operating the vehicle without a registration card and with improper tags. At this point the vehicle was taken to the station and impounded until it ownership was determined. While the vehicle was at the station, police noticed crowbars, a wrench, a claw hammer, some tire irons, screwdrivers and chisels, and three or four pairs of gloves. A search warrant was obtained, the tools were removed, and the tools were linked with a recent burglary. The court concluded that defendants' arrest was justified because the vehicle was being operated without a registration card. The court held that because the arrest was lawful and a search warrant had properly been issued, the tools were properly admitted. However, the court held that one defendant's presence in the car where the tools were found, several days after the burglary, was not sufficient to support his conviction.</SPAN></P>

A hearing was held before a jury, which rendered a verdict that defendant was a defective delinquent. Defendant filed an application for leave to appeal. Upon consideration, the court denied the application. The court held that: (1) the trial court correctly refused defendant's request for certain jury instructions; (2) defendant was not denied the right to a fair and impartial jury by the presence of a guard during the hearing; (3) psychiatric and psychological reports prepared by persons who were not called as witnesses were properly admitted into evidence; and (4) the defective delinquency law as applied to defendant was constitutional.

The court affirmed, holding that the indictment did charge an offense, as it alleged all of the elements of the crime proscribed by Md. Code art. 27, &sect; 30(a). The court thought that the time of the offense, &quot;in the daytime,&quot; was not an essential element of the crime, and was not used in the statute to define or characterize the offense, but merely to distinguish it from burglary that must be committed in the nighttime. The officer had probable cause to believe that the felony of daytime housebreaking, or larceny, had been committed and that defendant was the one who committed it. The record before the court was clear that the officers who assisted in the search had reasonable or probable cause to believe that evidence would be found in defendant's car.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At a bench conference prior to the selection of the jury, defense counsel stated an objection to a voir dire question requested by the State as to whether any potential jurors had conscientious scruples against capital punishment. Defense counsel stated that such a question was in violation of defendant's equal protection rights. The trial court allowed the question. Defendant was convicted of murder, and given a life sentence. He appealed, urging that he was denied due process and equal protection of the law by the trial court's inquiry into the prospective jurors' beliefs regarding capital punishment. Upon consideration, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that: (1) in light of Md. Ann. Code art. 51, &sect; 8A, it was the better practice for a trial court not to put or permit a question to prospective jurors as to their beliefs against capital punishment; but (2) in the circumstances of the instant case, the mere asking of the question did not violate defendant's constitutional rights, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in the asking of the question so as to require reversal. Prejudice was not to be presumed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was first convicted for the armed robbery in March 1961. Defendant filed a post-conviction petition, contending that he was denied the right to appeal his 1961 convictions and that his guilty pleas therein were involuntary. Subsequently, defendant was granted a new trial. Due to a change in case law, new indictments were returned against him for which the trial court convicted him. The court held that: (1) defendant was not placed in double jeopardy as a result of his second trial because it resulted from his post conviction petition; (2) testimony regarding a line-up identification was properly admitted, even assuming defendant's arrest was illegal, because there was no allegation that the line-up was unfair and the presence of counsel was not required under the law applicable to line-ups in 1961; and (3) defendant's contention that the trial court should have excluded all evidence because of an unreasonable delay between the arrest and the preliminary hearing was meritless because Maryland law did not require a preliminary hearing and there was no constitutional right to counsel at the time of arrest or preliminary hearing where no plea was taken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested on probable cause that he had committed an assault and battery. While he was in custody, hair and saliva specimens were obtained for comparison to hair and saliva found on a murdered woman. Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree without capital punishment. On appeal, defendant contended that his arrest was illegal and that the specimens were unlawfully obtained. He argued that the lower court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the illegality of his arrest, in admitting testimony regarding the hairs and saliva, and in admitting confessions rendered involuntary and inadmissible. The court affirmed the conviction and held that the arrest was based on probable cause that a felony had been committed and was valid. The constitutional right against self-incrimination was not violated by the taking of the specimens. The specimens were obtained with defendant's consent and therefore did not violate the Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures. The lower court's rulings and instructions were not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Maryland) convicting him of statutory rape.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court determined that the trial court had not erred in instructing the jury that ignorance of the age of the prosecuting witness was no defense. Defendant rested his claim on testimony elicited from a girl friend that the prosecuting witness told the girl friend that she was 15-years-old, and that she associated with an older crowd. Affirming defendant's conviction the court held that it was no defense that defendant did not know that the prosecuting witness was under the statutory age of consent. Defendant also alleged that the use of the word &quot;feloniously&quot; in the indictment created the necessity for the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to carnally know a female under the age of fourteen. The court rejected this contention and held that the indictment utilized the word &quot;feloniously&quot; merely as a descriptive term and its use in no way bound the State to prove intent, especially in view of the fact that intent was not a required element for the crime of statutory rape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ground for defendant's motion was that he had been denied a speedy trial. Defendant complained chiefly of the delay between February 11, 1964, the date of his last trial which resulted in a mistrial, and December 19, 1966, when he was reindicted after his election to void his prior indictment. The court examined the length of the delay, prejudice to defendant, the reason for the delay, and any waiver. The court ruled that defendant had waived his right to a speedy trial by several affirmative acts between February 11, 1964, and June 29, 1965. The court determined that between June 29, 1965, and January 14, 1966, the State was faced with difficult and unusual conditions and therefore, the delay was reasonable and not purposeful or oppressive. The court concluded that the period from January 14, 1966, to December 19, 1966, was a reasonable time in which to reindict defendant. Affirming, the court held that any prejudice that resulted from witnesses becoming unavailable was only one consideration and there was no unconstitutional delay.</SPAN></P>

Affirming, the court said that there was legally sufficient evidence from which the jury could have been fairly convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of defendant's guilt. The evidence supplied the jury with a sufficient basis to find the corpus delicti of first degree murder. The court found that there was a sufficient inference drawn from the testimony to negate any notion that the killing was the offspring of rashness or impetuosity, or that it was the instant effect of impulse. Defendant failed to establish a factual base upon which to establish a prima facie case and that the mere raising of a variation between the number of African American and white jurors, in and of itself alone, was not sufficient to constitute an adequate showing of the prerequisite competent evidence of jury discrimination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant received the maximum sentence after his second trial but received no credit for time served under his first sentence. The court held that the failure to give defendant credit for time served violated Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 25 and Md. Ann Code art. 27, &sect; 463 (1967). Although the second sentence was within the statutory limit, the court reasoned that defendant's actual sentence would exceed that limit absent a credit for time served. The court also determined that defendant's Fifth Amendment rights were not violated when he was required to utter certain words during a lineup because there was no showing that the identification procedure was conducted under conditions of unfairness or unreliability. The court found no error in the admission of defendant's statement regarding his whereabouts at the time of the rape because there was no showing that he requested and was denied counsel and because the statements were not the fruit of an unreasonable search. Since negative evidence was admissible only to contradict an opponent's positive evidence, there was no error in the exclusion of negative forensic tests results conducted for semen stains and fire escape scrapings.</SPAN></P>

Code art. 27, &sect; 551, authorized a search of persons, places or things, as reasonably particularized in the warrant, for specifically designated property, unlawfully obtained or held, or of evidence of the commission of the crime, including items relating thereto that were purely evidentiary in nature. The court held that a search warrant was not an arrest warrant, so that the directive to make an arrest included as one of the commands of the warrant was a conditional one -- valid only if the search revealed the commission of an offense in the presence of the officers, for which they also could make a warrantless arrest. The court held that flight gave the officers probable cause and that the search of defendant's person was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction for the second-degree murder of his wife on the grounds that he was denied his right to a speedy trial and that the trial court improperly excluded hospital records and refused requested instructions regarding involuntary intoxication. Defendant had pled not guilty by reason of insanity and not guilty for being a chronic alcoholic. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the five-month delay of trial was not unreasonable. The court found that the instructions regarding involuntary intoxication were properly refused because drunkenness should not be regarded as involuntary merely because it was the result of alcoholism. The court also found there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant was not so intoxicated as to be incapable of forming the intent to murder. The court held that the hospital records did qualify under the business record hearsay exception but that they were inadmissible because in a civil commitment a person could be committed as insane if he was a danger to himself or others even if he was able to distinguish between right and wrong, which was not the same standard for &quot;insane&quot; in criminal cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants' convictions arose out of a series of public meetings at a city park in which defendants gave speeches laced with offensive epithets directed towards African-Americans, Jews, and other groups. Acts of violence against minorities occurred following the speeches. The court affirmed defendants' convictions, holding that the speeches of defendants contained language and epithets of such a nature as to incite their audience to riot and were composed of derisive and fighting words that carried their remarks outside of the constitutional guarantees. Defendants' speeches were calculated to cause the interracial disorders that resulted therefrom and were therefore not within the guarantees of free speech. The whole purport of defendants' remarks was to encourage violence in their listeners. The court determined that tape recordings of the speeches were admissible even though certain parts of the recordings were inaudible because the greater portion was readily intelligible. The court affirmed defendants' sentences because the consequences of their offenses were serious and violations of the law such as they were found guilty of provoking and committing could not be minimized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenant heard loud noises, called the police, and defendants were apprehended some 50-75 feet away from the rental office. The officers noticed fresh jimmy marks on the rental office door and the doorjamb had been pried away for an area of about four inches. A search of the area nearby where defendants were taken into custody revealed a flashlight, a pair of gloves, and a crowbar. Defendants were convicted of the offenses of storehouse breaking and being a rogue and a vagabond pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 490, from which they each appealed. The court held that the above items were sufficiently connected with defendants' activities as to warrant their admission into evidence on both the storehouse breaking and rogue and vagabond charges. One defendant claimed that the State's Attorney's cross-examination of him concerning his prior criminal record was prejudicial because he denied the convictions, but the State's Attorney referred his criminal record on file with the F.B.I. The court held that the matter was not reviewable because defendants entered no objection to the questions propounded by the State's Attorney nor filed a motion for a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded not guilty and was convicted on three of the indictments. Defendant was never called for trial on the fourth indictment, for which a stet was entered. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictments, which the trial court granted. Prior thereto, four new indictments charging defendant with the same crimes as the original indictments were filed, and defendant pleaded not guilty on all four new indictments. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the new indictments on double jeopardy grounds, which the trial court denied. Defendant appealed, and the court held that because defendant elected to have the original indictments declared invalid, he was not placed in double jeopardy by a trial on the new indictments. The court found that any delay in the trial on three of the new indictments was caused primarily by defendant, and thus, he was not denied a speedy trial thereon. The court determined that defendant would not be twice put in jeopardy by a trial under the fourth new indictment as he was never called to trial on the stetted indictment, but additional evidence was necessary to determine whether defendant's right to a speedy trial thereon was violated.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial judge did not err in finding that defendant's confession was voluntary. The court agreed that defendant's allegation that certain police officers perjured themselves at the trial, by testifying that he was arrested two days after he said he was arrested, had no factual basis. The court found that because none of defendant's allegations were previously waived by him, Md. Ann.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted on the first and second counts of his armed robbery indictment. Defendant appealed and asserted numerous alleged errors. Upon review, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that there was no error in finding that the prosecution had sustained its burden of proving that defendant's confession had been freely and voluntarily given because there was credible evidence that the statement had not been obtained through any implied threats by police officers, that the statement had not been obtained after defendant had requested and been denied counsel, and that it was given after defendant had been advised of his right to be silent; therefore, defendant's confession was properly admitted into evidence. The court held that when defendant became a witness for the limited purpose of assessing the voluntariness of his statement, he was not immune from impeachment by cross-examination about prior convictions. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain his conviction. The court held that although the general verdict on the first and second counts was inconsistent, only one sentence had been imposed, and defendant had suffered no prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a town's treasurer, challenged an order of the Circuit Court for St. Mary's County (Maryland), which convicted him for embezzlement, a violation of Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 129, and grand larceny. His motion to dismiss the indictment had been denied prior to trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of larceny for taking money from a safe as town treasurer, and embezzlement for taking the town's deposits. The court held that the selection of the grand jury was constitutional based on the strong presumption that prospective jurors were questioned as to their belief in God, was rebutted by direct evidence in the instant case. Further, the court rejected defendant's contention that under &sect; 89 of St. Mary's County, Md., Code Pub. Loc. Laws, the panel was not selected from a list of taxable residents as no list was compiled because notice of the time and place of selection was not first given to members of the bar, and that the apportionment provision was not correctly applied. The court found no error in the failure to have a list of all taxable residents, and a lack of prior notice to members of the bar did not invalidate the jury's drawing. Moreover, strict compliance with the apportionment provisions of the 150 names on the panel was not required. The court also noted that defendant was a &quot;public officer&quot; within the meaning of Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 129.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the warrantless entry of police into defendant's vehicle, whether that action was a &quot;search&quot; within the meaning of the Constitution, or not, was reasonable and, as such, not in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The court reasoned in part that while the action of the police in removing the contents of defendant's car did not fit squarely within one of the usual exceptions to the rule that a search, to be reasonable, must rest upon a search warrant, the ultimate test, was whether the search was &quot;otherwise reasonable.&quot; The court reasoned that the search was &quot;otherwise reasonable&quot; because defendant had been lawfully arrested on the basis of an outstanding warrant for his arrest, the police would have been derelict in their duty had they left defendant's vehicle at the scene of the arrest, and when the police undertook the search they did not suspect that any items therein had been stolen.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment as to the count of robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon. The court held that defendant's contention, that his arrest was unlawful, was without merit because an illegal arrest did not invalidate a subsequent conviction. Moreover, the illegality of arrest, by itself, was immaterial as it produced no fruits offered as evidence in the case. The court further held that the imposition of the sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because it was within the lawful limits and it was not contended that the trial court was improperly motivated in imposing it. However, the court reversed the judgment as to the count of assault of each of the indictments. The court held that because there was no evidence of any physical beating of the victims during perpetration of any of the robberies, it found the conviction on the assault counts to have been in error, as they merged with the counts charging robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A detective saw defendant carry slot machines from a car to his house. He reported his observations to the sheriff, secured a warrant, went to defendant's home, and participated fully in the arrest and search. Officers saw enough while executing the warrant to show that two of occupants possessed narcotics. The court rejected defendant's argument that Md. Code art. 27, &sect; 551 granted exclusive power to &quot;policemen, constables, and police officers&quot; to serve and return search warrants and that a sheriff could not do so. He also argued that the warrant's factual basis had to be within the applicant's personal knowledge and could not be sworn on information and belief, even if the sources were cited in the affidavit. The court disagreed, holding that Maryland law was consistent with federal law on the issue. In this case, the informant's statements set forth in the affidavit were detailed and reliable enough to support a probable cause determination, and thus the evidence seized was properly admitted. The court further rejected as without merit defendant's argument that insufficient evidence was presented that he was guilty of receiving stolen property under Md.

The court found that the inmate's allegations of improper identification and being induced to make damaging statements had been abandoned at the post conviction hearing and, in any event, were waived by the inmate's guilty plea. Further, the inmate was not denied due process of law by being sentenced a judge who did not preside at his trial and the fact that he received a longer sentence from the sentencing judge than he expected from the other judge did not give him grounds for relief. Instead, the sentence was within the maximum prescribed by the statute and the inmate entered his guilty plea voluntarily, with the knowledge that the maximum sentence that could be imposed was 10 years. Finally, defendant's chronic alcoholism was not a defense to the crime of robbery, as the excusal of a chronic alcoholic from criminal prosecution was confined exclusively to those acts on a defendant's part that were compulsive as symptomatic of the disease.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State of Maryland challenged a decision of the Circuit Court for Charles County (Maryland), which dismissed indictments against defendants. Defendants claimed that they were denied their rights to a speedy trial under Md. Const. Decl. Rights Art. 21 and the Sixth Amendment. They also claimed they were not brought to trial within the time frame contemplated by Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect;&sect; 616A-616S.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were indicted for rape and incarcerated. After their trial was delayed, they filed a motion for a speedy trial pursuant to Md. Const. Decl. Rights Art. 21 and the Sixth Amendment. Defendants thereafter filed several motions but did not renew their request for a speedy trial. The trial court dismissed their indictments but the court reversed its decision. The court rejected defendants' assertions that Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect;&sect; 616A-616S created a time frame in which a trial needed to be granted, finding that these statutes only applied when a detainer was lodged against a prisoner who entered upon a term of imprisonment. Although a delay was created when the State removed this matter pursuant to Md. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8, the court found that this delay was not oppressive or prejudicial. The determination of whether an accused's rights to a speedy trial had been violated was determinate on the circumstances of the proceeding. The incarceration of defendants was relevant to deciding whether a delay had been oppressive but was not determinate in that regard. Defendants could not expect to be freed after sitting in silence upon a prosecutor's inaction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that the evidence was not legally sufficient to support the conviction.

The court further held that the trial court did not reach the wrong conclusion as to the law. Defendant then contended that the statute under which appellant was charged and convicted was unconstitutional for failure to require scienter. The court found that the 1960 amendment to Md. Ann.

The licensing fees paid to petitioner reduced the Maryland taxable income of its parent, prompting respondent comptroller's assessment on the basis that petitioner was a phantom corporation. Petitioner appealed, and the court reversed. The court found that petitioner was not a phantom corporation, and therefore the nexus of the parent corporation could not be attributed to petitioner. Petitioner maintained offices, employees, and agents in Delaware. The only contact petitioner had with Maryland was through its parent. Petitioner did not own or lease property in Maryland, had no employees, agents, or offices in Maryland, and its income-producing activity all occurred outside of Maryland. Further, petitioner was established for valid non-tax reasons, including the holding and managing of intangible assets in a separate corporation.

The corporation's activities of catalog distribution could not be distinguished from the corporation's retail sales, given that 80 percent of the corporation's sales were through retail outlet sales and that the retail outlets in Maryland distributed 400 catalogs per month to customers. An amendment to Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect;&sect; 11-102(a) and 11-101(k), which created an exemption from the use tax of catalog sales and direct mail advertising distributed in Maryland from outside of the state prior to a certain date, left intact the taxability of such distributions after that date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The cable companies argued that closed circuit telecasts or subscription television broadcasts were not meant to include their pay-per-view showings of boxing and wrestling events, the tax was an impermissible burden on freedom of speech, and the application of the tax to cable television was inconsistent with federal statutes and regulations that had a pre-emptive effect. On review the court affirmed. The court held that it was the intent of legislature to impose a tax on the amount charged for viewing professional boxing or wrestling contests. The court held that the language of Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. &sect;&sect; 6-101, 6-102 was necessarily broad so that the commission would be able to perform its regulatory function. A proper construction of the language required inclusion of the pay-per-view showings. The freedom of speech argument failed when the court held that there was no indication that the tax was targeted against cable television in a purposeful attempt to interfere with its First Amendment activities.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers' appeal was based on two grounds: (1) the State of Maryland could not tax the gain realized on the sale of United States obligations (Treasury Bonds); and (2) the State of Maryland had enacted a law that discriminated in its treatment of taxation between federal retiree pensions and State retiree pensions and this law was unconstitutional based on a recent United States Supreme Court decision. The taxpayers argued 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3124(a) prohibited not only taxation on the obligation, or principal, and the interest on the obligation, but also taxation on any gain or profit realized from the sale of the obligation. The court held it was the gains on the sale of the obligations that were being taxed. The court found that now where in &sect; 3124(a) did the words &quot;gains&quot; or &quot;profits&quot; appear. The court held that &sect; 3124(a) did not prohibit the State from taxing the gain on the sale of United States obligations. The taxpayers argued Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. &sect; 10-207(o) permitted preferential treatment for taxation of state pensions which was not rendered to federal pensions.

After an audit, an adjustment was made by the Comptroller to the numerator of the sales factor to include broadcast receipts reflecting the state's network audience to the total network audience. The company contended that the Comptroller improperly instituted a new method for developing a sales factor for the broadcast industry by its adjustment that could only be implemented after adoption of a regulation. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the adjustment was an attempt to change the source rule for income from an origin to a destination basis and was a substantial deviation from Md. Regs. Code tit. 3, &sect; 04.01.03E(6)(b)(ii). The court determined that the Comptroller's use of the equitable adjustment provision, Md. Regs. Code tit. 3, &sect; 04.01.03G, to require a change in the numerator of the sales factor was a regulation as the adjustment was adopted to carry out the Comptroller's taxing authority.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxes were collected by a city that had not amended its taxing ordinance to include &quot;games of entertainment,&quot; which term had been recently added to Md.

The court, in remanding the petition for a calculation of a refund, determined that the added term was intended to clarify, not expand, the reach of the taxing statute and that, therefore, the vendors' gross receipts from such amusement devices were subject to the admissions and amusement tax. The court reasoned that the plain meaning of the former version of &sect; 402(a)(1)(iii) necessarily included such games and rejected the vendors' assertions that the former statutes were ambiguous. Finding that it lacked authority to adjudicate the constitutionality of the statute or ordinance, which the vendors asserted were impermissibly vague, the court found that the vendors failed to meet their burden to demonstrate that certain exemptions under the statute were palpably arbitrary. Finally, however, the court remanded the cause because the Comptroller was unable to determine which of the vendors' receipts were reported or the method in which the tax had been calculated.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers argued the legislature in enacting Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect;&sect; 14, 232 specifically rejected the triennial assessment system. The court disagreed. The court held that Md. Ann.

However, the court reversed and remanded the comptroller's denial of the taxpayer's request for a refund of sales and uses taxes that were a supplemental claim to the taxpayer's original claim. The court held that the comptroller's policy of treating supplemental claims as new claims was invalid and that the court could consider the claim, despite the lack of a final hearing by the comptroller. The court concluded that the sale tax did not apply to the directories because they were not &quot;a sale at retail&quot; within the state and that the directories were within the &quot;products held for sale&quot; exemption provided in Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation argued that dividends from its Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC) were not given proper tax treatment. The corporation urged that Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 280A(c)(7), which set forth how such dividends were to be treated, was unconstitutional because it violated the Commerce Clause by impermissibly encouraging corporations with DISCs to conduct a sizeable portion of their business in Maryland so as to be eligible for a deduction under &sect; 280A(c)(7). The corporation also argued that income derived from other corporations, which were its subsidiaries and affiliates or of which it was a part owner, should have been apportioned to the State. Upon review, the court held that it was without jurisdiction to entertain the corporation's appeal to the extent that it requested the court to declare part of a statute unconstitutional and, as such, issued an order affirming the part of the assessment relating to income from the DISC. The court affirmed the assessment based on the corporation's receipt of income from certain related corporations and reversed the assessment as to other corporations. The court made its determination based upon the unitary business tests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The major issue presented on appeal was whether the taxpayer was allowed to utilize a net operating loss deduction, computed under generally accepted accounting principles and I.R.C. &sect; 172 solely by reference to its losses in prior years allocable to a project. The court found that the deduction would have inherently required the maintenance of a separate Maryland account for which there was no authority. The taxpayer attempted to use a deduction created by carrying forward losses from a particular asset, the Maryland Project, to be used as a reduction from the gain incurred on the sale of that asset. This deduction was not permissible under federal law; therefore, in order to achieve conformity with the federal tax laws, Maryland denied the deduction also. The net operating loss deduction was therefore only available for the taxpayer if its combined Maryland and Michigan operations sustained a loss, not if only its Maryland operation sustained a net operating loss. There was no net operating loss deduction for the building alone, as it was only available to the taxpayer as a corporate entity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner taxpayers challenged the property tax assessment of respondent assessor. The Property Tax Assessment Appeal Board (board) for Montgomery County (Maryland) found that the triennial system that was authorized by Md. Ann.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board found that the triennial system that was authorized by &sect; 232(8) violated Md. Const. Decl.

Upon its determination that it did not have the authority to invalidate &sect; 232(8), however, the board requested the director of the state department of assessment and taxation to enforce a review of the valuation of all of the properties in the county reassessed. Upon appeal, the court affirmed the assessments of the taxpayers' properties as valued in accordance with the triennial assessment system because the classification of the residential real property into three group, with only one-third subject each year to reassessment, bore a rational relationship to both a legitimate state purpose and the objects of the legislation. Therefore, the court held that there was no intentional or arbitrary discrimination as prohibited by federal and state constitutional provisions, and that any non-uniformity which resulted from the classification was not sufficient so as to deprive the taxpayers of constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer, a corporation, purchased another vendor, which owed sales and use taxes for transactions occurring prior to the purchase. The comptroller was not formally notified of the purchase arrangement prior to the actual sale, and unpaid sales taxes previously generated by the vendor were assessed against the taxpayer. The taxpayer appealed the comptroller's decision, arguing that it was not personally liable for taxes owed by the predecessor vendor because the sale of the vendor to the taxpayer was not a bulk transfer as defined by Maryland commercial law and therefore was not subject to the notification requirements of Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 353. In the alternative, the taxpayer contended that the comptroller had actual knowledge of the sale based on the taxpayer's bulk sale tax return that was filed with payment. The court affirmed the decision of the comptroller because by failing to give the required notice, the taxpayer became liable for any sales taxes due from the vendor. The court also affirmed the imposition of a sales tax on a conveyor system sold by the taxpayer because the taxpayer failed to prove that the conveyor system was transported by a common carrier.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded to the county to recompute the tax differential. The court held that &sect; 12G-8 did not violate any constitutional mandate and there was no question that the county had the power to levy the tax differential using its own computational methods, so long as it was based on the services performed by the municipality. The court found that &sect; 12G-8 required separate tax districts and improperly resorted to a benefits-received analysis of property taxation.

Code Ann. art. 81, &sect; 405, the taxpayer was mandated to pay admissions taxes on or before the 10th day of the month and under Md.

They also claimed that the issue as to preferential agricultural use assessment was res judicata based on the rezoning documents and prior judicial action. The hearing examiner found that a principal-agent relationship existed between the taxpayer and the realtor who handled the rezoning and that there was no question that the issue was res judicata. He found the taxpayer's constitutional argument frivolous and pointed out that the ex post facto limitation in the U.S. Constitution applied only to criminal matters. He recommended affirming the assessment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner representative appealed a decision of respondent Register of Wills for Prince George's County, Maryland, who taxed estate property for inheritance purposes on the basis of its fair market value instead of using the farm use appraisal method under which the property had previously been taxed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent's estate included several parcels of land in Maryland which, prior to her death, had been evaluated for property tax purposes on the farm use appraisal method under Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 19(b)(1) and had been taxed accordingly. However, when it was time to determine inheritance taxes, the Register taxed the estate property on the basis of its fair market value. The deceased's foreign representative appealed, arguing that the farm use method should have been used. The Register argued that &sect; 19(b)(1) was applicable only to ordinary taxation and that Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 6 defined the inheritance tax as a special tax. The court sustained the Register's decision, holding that &sect; 6 made a distinction between special and ordinary taxes, and &sect; 6(4) provided that inheritance taxes were special taxes. Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 19(b)(1) applied to ordinary or direct taxes, such as those directly imposed with respect to real and personal property, and it did not apply to inheritance taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner church trustees sought review of a decision from the Property Tax Assessment Appeal Board of Montgomery County (Maryland) assessing property taxes on two single family dwellings located on lots contiguous to property used by the church.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trustees contended that each of the two homes in question were used as parsonages and should have been exempt from property taxation pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 9(c). Respondent Supervisor of Assessments of Montgomery County (Maryland) argued that the statute was intended to allow only one exemption for a parsonage per church. The facts indicated that the church employed three &quot;ministers.&quot; The court found that the legislature only intended that an exemption for a parsonage be allowed to the head of the congregation. Since that minister owned his own property, no parsonage exemption could have been allowed to the church. However, the home used by the minister in charge of the educational functions of the church was entitled to an exemption because it was property owned by the church and was actually used exclusively for educational purposes. The evidence indicated that that minister was in charge of all educational functions and the court believed that providing him with a home was appropriate and convenient to carry out the purpose of the church. The home of the minister of music was not subject to an exemption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision from the Board as to the home occupied by the music minister and reversed the decision of the Board which denied an exemption from property tax as to the home occupied by the education minister.</SPAN></P>
