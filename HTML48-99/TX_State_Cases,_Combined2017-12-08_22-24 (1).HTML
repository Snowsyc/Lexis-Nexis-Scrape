</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for attempted murder imposed by the District Court of Dallas County (Texas).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted murder, and punishment was enhanced. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence a penitentiary packet as proof of a prior theft conviction, because the theft statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03 (1974), had become unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous rendering the conviction void. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction, finding that &sect; 31.03 was neither vague nor ambiguous, and that the penitentiary packet was properly admitted into evidence. The statute was presumed to be valid, and defendant was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was unconstitutionally vague. The negation of effective consent was illustrated four alternative ways in &sect; 31.01(4). Considering that the allegedly vague and ambiguous language had four expressed statutory definitions, the court held that the presumption of validity had not been overcome beyond a reasonable doubt even though the statutory definitions were not exhaustive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to possession of more than 5 but less than 50 pounds of marijuana. Defendant sought review, and the court affirmed. Defendant filed a petition for discretionary review, which was granted, and the case was remanded to the court for reconsideration. The court affirmed, holding that the declaration that an amendment to the Controlled Substances Act was invalid did not remove the conduct of possessing marijuana from criminal penalties. Although the amendment to the act was declared unconstitutional, the act was still valid under Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35. Therefore, possession of marijuana was still a criminal offense. Finally, the court held that defendant failed to show that he was harmed by any erroneous admonition by the court prior to the entry of his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, Plano Independent School District, its acting tax collector, and the tax collector of Collin County Central Appraisal District, failed to file appeal bonds as required by Tex.

The court held that an appeal bond was not required of appellant Collin County under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann., art. 279a (1973) and Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2276 (1971). The court reversed the judgment in favor of appellee property owner granting an injunction against appellant Collin County because appellee failed to present summary judgment evidence to discharge his burden establishing that the property sought to be assessed and taxed did not lie within the boundaries of appellant Collin County.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the County Criminal Court of Law No. 7, Harris County, Texas, which convicted him of promoting an obscene device within the meaning of Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 43.21(a)(7) and 43.23(c)(1) were unconstitutional on their face and as applied to his case. He also challenged the inconsistency of the information under which he was charged, which referred to the obscene device in the singular and the plural. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that &sect;&sect; 43.21(a)(7) and 43.23(c)(1), which were part of the Texas Obscenity Statute, were constitutional. The court rejected the argument that the statutes invaded defendant's right to privacy, noting that defendant was not charged with possessing an obscene device within the confines of his home, but was charged with the offense of promotion of an obscene device. The court found that while it would have been better to phrase the information consistently singular or consistently plural, the court did not find that this harmed defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant of promoting an obscene device because the sections of the Texas Obscenity Statute under which defendant was convicted were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of a District Court, Dallas County (Texas), which denied his application for writ of habeas corpus and remanded him for extradition to another state, in an action involving a habeas corpus hearing before a magistrate and sufficiency of evidence in sustaining the judgment of extradition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that because the trial judge did not enter a referral order, his habeas corpus hearing was improperly held before a magistrate, and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a judgment of extradition. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that although the record contained a transcription of a &quot;writ of habeas corpus&quot; hearing held before a magistrate, the trial court judgment unequivocally stated that the trial judge heard the evidence and that he was of the opinion that appellant was legally held in custody; absent evidence in rebuttal, the court could not infer otherwise. The court could not address appellant's arguments that the magistrate lacked jurisdiction to hear the writ and that there was no referral order. The court further held that the record contained a governor's warrant that was regular on its face, thus under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 51.13 &sect; 3 (1979), the warrant alone became prima facie evidence authorizing extradition; no defensive theory was placed in issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment which denied appellant's writ of habeas corpus and which remanded him for extradition, because there was a presumption that the trial judge heard evidence pertaining to the extradition and the presumption was not rebutted, even though the magistrate also conducted a hearing. The evidence was sufficient, because the governor's warrant, regular on its face, was prima facie evidence authorizing extradition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four unrelated, mentally retarded men, along with their two supervising houseparents, moved into a subdivision house that the evidence indicated was a permanent living arrangement. Appellee city filed suit against appellant subdivision homeowner seeking to permanently enjoin appellants from using the property as a group home, as such use allegedly violated residential covenants and city zoning ordinances. The court concluded that the property was a &quot;single-family dwelling&quot; similar to other structures in the same neighborhood; that the property was used as a single-family residence in accordance with the manifest purpose and the clear intention of the zoning ordinance; and that the occupants met the definition of a &quot;family&quot; since there was no requirement that the parties occupying a dwelling and living as a &quot;single housekeeping unit&quot; be related by blood or marriage. While the home may be properly called a &quot;group home,&quot; the court held that it was clear that the home did not qualify as a boarding house, lodging house, or hotel as defined and prohibited in the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and order that the permanent injunction be dissolved, concluding that the trial court's findings that the use of appellants' property violated both the zoning ordinance and the restrictive covenant were improper bases for the permanent injunction, since the dwelling was used as a &quot;single-family&quot; residence and the occupants met the definition of a &quot;family.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former husband and appellant former wife had been married and divorced twice. The parties were married 187 months of the 240 months appellant was in the military. Neither divorce decree awarded appellee any interest in appellant's retirement benefits. Appellee had filed a previous partition suit, and the trial court had awarded her an interest in the benefits. However, the decision was reversed by the Texas Supreme Court, and it was ordered that appellee take nothing. Appellee filed suit again seeking to partition appellant's retirement benefits in light of the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (Act), 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1408. The lower court ordered a partition of appellant's benefits, and he challenged, arguing that appellee's action was barred by res judicata. The court disagreed and affirmed the lower court's judgment. Initially, the court found that the Act was properly applied to the case. Further, the doctrine of res judicata did not apply in the case because applying the doctrine of res judicata would subvert the intent and the plain meaning of the Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contestant challenged a judgment from the Probate Court No. 3 of Harris County (Texas), which had appointed a temporary guardian of a ward. Appellee temporary guardian moved to dismiss the appeal because of mootness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee guardian was appointed as temporary guardian of the estate of a ward. Appellant contestant sought to set aside appellee's appointment and challenged the constitutionality of Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 131 and 133 (1980). Appellee moved to dismiss the appeal for mootness, and the court granted the motion. The court noted that the trial court had approved the closing of the temporary guardianship and had appointed another as limited guardian over the ward's estate. The ward had given appellee a full release with respect to claims concerning her estate or assets. Thus, the court held that the controversy between the parties had ceased to exist, and there was no longer a justiciable controversy that would have authorized a declaratory judgment. Additionally, it was unnecessary to decide whether the challenged sections were unconstitutional as a basis for relief sought by appellant, and any opinion would merely have been an advisory opinion, which the court was not authorized to issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, whose parents were Holocaust victims, sought review of a judgment of the 228th District Court of Harris County (Texas), which convicted appellant of murdering an individual he &quot;arrested&quot; for damaging a friend's car.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of murdering an individual who damaged a friend's car, argued trial court error in charging the jury on the use of deadly force to make an arrest. The court disagreed, noting first that appellant shot the victim after he made a threatening movement when appellant told him to &quot;get up against the car.&quot; Explaining, the court ruled that the instruction properly reflected appellant's theories of defense, that force was justified in effecting an arrest and that he acted in self defense. No error occurred when evidence related to appellant's then state of mind was excluded. Although Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.06 (1974) allowed for testimony on state of mind, testimony as to effect of being related to a Holocaust survivor had upon his belief of being in danger was irrelevant to the issue of self defense. A new trial was not required despite evidence of jury misconduct in discussing parole law; no showing was made that the jurors relied on a misstatement of the law to increase the punishment; nor did a mistrial need to be declared when the trial court's instruction to disregard followed improper jury argument by the prosecutor on early termination of probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed convicting appellant of murder, because testimony as to his state of mind -- a belief stemming from being a Holocaust descendant of then being in danger -- was irrelevant to the issue of self defense when attempting to effect an arrest, as jury instructions properly reflected appellant's theories of defense, and as a new trial was not required for jury misconduct when jury did not rely on a juror's misstatement of parole law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee city in a quo warranto proceeding brought by relators, state and property owners, that sought to enjoin appellee from the collection of taxes upon property annexed by appellee. The court held that the validation statute, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 974d-28, which validated original boundary lines of an incorporated municipality, or any extensions of those boundaries adopted prior to January 1, 1975, even if those actions were not in accordance with the law, was constitutional. The court stated that the legislature was free to validate any act that it had the power to authorize initially. The court rejected relators' argument that the statute was unconstitutionally retroactive because a property owner was afforded no constitutional right regarding the location or existence of municipalities. The court rejected relators' argument that the statute was a denial of due process because the constitutional inhibition against taking private property for public use without compensation had reference solely to the exercise of the right of eminent domain and not to taxation for public use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee proponent received a direct bequest under the will and codicil of an elderly testatrix for whom he had long served as attorney and financial advisor. The testatrix also left 90 percent of the residual estate to charity, with appellee as trustee. Appellant contestant, the testatrix's only child, brought an action alleging that appellee had exercised undue influence. The jury found that the testatrix was of sound mind when the will and codicil were executed and that the instruments were not the result of undue influence. The trial court entered judgment on the verdict admitting the will and codicil to probate. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the existence of a fiduciary relationship between appellee and the testatrix did not, in and of itself, give rise to a presumption of undue influence or place upon appellee the burden of establishing the fairness of the transaction. Whatever the testatrix's reasons may have been, the court concluded, the record supported the belief that her bequests to charities and to appellee rather than appellant were her deliberate decisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment from the 262nd District Court of Harris County (Texas) that convicted him of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, methamphetamine, a violation of Controlled Substances Act, Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, methamphetamine, a violation of the Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15 &sect; 4.03, and pled nolo contendere to theft, a violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03. The court affirmed the judgment that convicted appellant of both offenses and remanded the possession case for resentencing. The court declared that the facts alleged and proved established the possession offense. Appellant's guilty plea to possession was voluntary because the district court correctly overruled appellant's motion to quash this indictment when his offense violated the Act, which applied despite its unconstitutional amendment. The court found that the plea bargain for possession and theft did not lack consideration because the range of punishment exceeded the recommended term. The court determined that appellant's plea to possession constituted an express waiver of any error, which rendered moot the issue of whether he preserved for review his pretrial motion to suppress the methamphetamine. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant's motion to set aside his pleas.</SPAN></P>

Under that statute, defendant's sentence would have been different, and he would not have been fined. The court held that it could not reform a sentence that was void at its inception. The court overruled defendant's other claims of error, finding the hearsay testimony of extraneous offenses was properly admitted as part of the res gestae of the offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant utility commission sought review of the decision from the District Court of Travis County, 147th District (Texas), which granted an injunction pendite lite on the application of appellee utility company in its suit against appellant seeking permanent and injunctive relief related to utility rates charged by appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee utility company's rates had not been fixed by any action of appellant utility commission. After an inquiry into its billing practices, an order required appellee to make changes. Appellee filed a motion that appellant, under authority of Public Utility Regulation Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1446c, &sect; 43(d), could have established temporary rates. The examiner concluded that appellee failed to make a prima facie case to justify those rates. Review of that decision was sustained. Appellee filed a lawsuit in the district court and alleged that the residuum of its rates, permitted to be charged after the requisite changes in its billing practices, were unconstitutional and confiscatory. The district court granted appellee's request for an injunction pendente lite. The court reversed the injunction order and dissolved the injunction pendite lite because any loss sustained by appellee was properly considered not as a violation of appellee's constitutional rights, but as a necessary incident of rate regulation. The court held that injury claimed by appellee did not justify judicial subordination of the purposes underlying the exhaustion doctrine.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5472e, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A contractor entered a security agreement on its accounts receivable in order to obtain promissory notes from appellant non-beneficiary bank. The contractor ordered materials from appellee beneficiary-materialman. The property owners partially paid, and the trial court entered an injunction ordering that the checks be placed in an escrow account with appellant. Appellant and appellee entered into a dispute about which party was entitled to the money. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellee, and the court of appeals affirmed. The court held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5472e, &sect; 4 did not operate to terminate a trust created by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5472e, &sect; 1 when appellant claimed a non-beneficiary interest in money declared to be a trust fund in accordance with art. 5472e, &sect; 1. Art. 5472e, &sect; 4 specifically stated that the mechanics' lien statute did not apply to banks. Art. 5472e, &sect; 4 was intended to protect lenders and title companies from criminal charges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant consumer challenged the judgment from the County Court at Law No. 3 of Nueces County (Texas), in favor of appellee credit company on appellant's claim that appellee violated the Texas Consumer Credit Code, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5069-7.01, et seq. (1984). Appellant attacked certain provisions of a form installment contract that he had signed in connection with his purchase of a vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee credit company was the assignee of an installment contract for the appellant's purchase of a car. The contract was performed in accordance with its terms. Appellant alleged that the installment contract contained technical violations of the Texas Consumer Credit Code, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The court noted that many of appellant's points of error had already been disposed of in prior decisions of the Texas Supreme Court and intermediate appellate courts. For example, appellant attacked a notice sent by appellee to correct a contract provision that had been ruled objectionable, because it was made pursuant to a statute that appellant asserted was unconstitutional. The court pointed out that the Texas Supreme Court had already rejected such a challenge to the underlying statute. The court rejected appellant's claim that the installment contract's insurance requirement was not clear and conspicuous, because the court found it to be both.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There had been several burglaries in a subdivision. Police officer had been told appellant was responsible for the burglaries. Police officer saw a vehicle which matched the description of appellant's car and bore the license number of his car. Appellant accused was stopped, questioned, and arrested. A search of appellant's car revealed a number of items taken in recent burglaries. Witness told officials that six days before the arrest, he had been with appellant when appellant emerged from a mobile home carrying a television set and some guns. The lower court convicted appellant of burglary of a habitation. The court reversed and remanded the lower court's conviction of appellant because the unconstitutional intrusion could not have been justified retroactively by the evidence uncovered as a result of the intrusion on appellant's constitutional rights. Such vague and meager information could not have, merely by being relayed to the officer, be converted into &quot;articulable facts&quot; sufficient to justify the stop of appellant. Thus, the stop, detention, and arrest of appellant was in violation of appellant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and the Texas constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of promotion of obscenity for selling an obscene magazine and was assessed a punishment of 10 days' confinement. Upon review, appellant argued that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he knew the content and character of the material because state relied upon the presumption contained in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23 (1984). Under that section, a person commits the offense if, knowing the contents and character, he promotes or possesses with intent to promote any obscene material. The presumption provided that a person who promoted obscene material was presumed to do so with knowledge of its content and character. That presumption was declared unconstitutional. In the trial court, appellant stipulated that he intentionally sold the magazine in the county in which he was charged. The court held that state requested the trial court to consider the evidence along with the statutory presumption, but state could not rely on the presumption to prove its case. As such, the judgment was reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial void of the presumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that found appellant guilty of promotion of obscenity and remanded the cause for a new trial because state requested the trial court use a presumption in determining guilt that had previously been found to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the amendments to art. 4476-15 were declared unconstitutional, and, therefore, the act remained in full force even where there was no savings clause. The court held that the trial court conducted the trial under the pre-amended version of art. 4476-15 and that its charge to the jury did not contain any reference to the weight of controlled substance as was required by the amendment.

He had confessed to causing a number of injuries to the child, including bite marks, burns from a hot fork, and bruises. He also admitted shaking and shoving the child. He was convicted of injury to a child under the age of 14 years. The court affirmed because appellant's admission of roughly shaking the child and the medical testimony that the cause of death was a shaking syndrome were sufficient to sustain the jury's finding of guilt of causing serious bodily injury by shaking. The court held that appellant's own testimony and the jury's own common experience as to the heat of cooking utensils used for frying foods were sufficient for the jury to conclude that appellant's exculpatory assertion, that he did not know the fork was hot, was false. The court held that, even if there had been insufficient evidence to convict appellant under each of the theories charged by the trial court, that insufficiency would not render the evidence insufficient to sustain the general verdict rendered by the jury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant nephew sought review of the decision of the 234th District Court of Harris County, Texas, which granted appellee uncle summary judgment on grounds that appellant was precluded from recovery against appellee under the Texas Guest Statute, Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant nephew was riding as a passenger in appellee uncle's car when he sustained injuries in an automobile accident. Appellant sued appellee, and the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee because appellant was precluded from recovery under the Texas Guest Statute, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6710b, &sect; 1(a) (1975). Appellant argued that the statute violated equal protection of the law and that the wrong method of computing degree of affinity was used. The court affirmed and held that the Texas Guest Statute was constitutional and that the court could not redraft legislation because another version may be more equitable. The court held that Texas had followed the common law method of computing degrees of kinship and that appellant was within the second degree of consanguinity or affinity with appellee and was, therefore, precluded from suing appellee as host-driver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of engaging in organized criminal activity, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 71.02(a)(1). The court affirmed, holding that it was not necessary, even when a motion to quash was presented, to specifically allege the manner and means of acting in the course of committing theft in an indictment for aggravated robbery. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, since the statute required an accused to know of the criminal activity of the group, specific terms in the statute could be understood by persons of reasonable intelligence, and prosecution was not given unbridled discretion. The court found that the legislature's intent to punish organized criminal activity more severely than random crime was legitimate. Finally, the court overruled appellant's final ground of error that he should have been prosecuted for attempted aggravated robbery or for conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery, rather than the more general offense of engaging in organized criminal activity, holding that the statutes regarding attempt and conspiracy did not govern the same subject matter as does the organized criminal activity statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The officers had pre-arranged that once appellant had offered informant the drugs, she would raise her hand. Upon observing the informant's raised hand, the officers approached appellant. During the search, drugs were discovered in appellant's shoe and he was arrested for intentionally and knowingly possessing with the intent to deliver a controlled substance. At appellant's trial the informant did not testify. After appellant was convicted, he sought review and argued that because the informant did not testify, there was insufficient evidence that he intended to &quot;sell&quot; the drugs. The appellate court found that the only evidence that appellant intended to deliver the substance was the informant's alleged hand signal and without her testimony, the state failed to carry its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant possessed with the intent to deliver the drugs. The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment and ordered appellant acquitted because there was insufficient evidence to warrant the jury's finding of appellant's guilt for the intent to transfer a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed, holding that there was sufficient evidence to find that appellant operated the vehicle in the county in which he was charged. In so ruling, the appellate court first noted that the term &quot;operated&quot; as used in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.07(a) meant actual physical control. The appellate court then noted that appellant was stopped by two police officers (prior to the vehicle being reported as stolen) in the county in which he was convicted. Further, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on the law of circumstantial evidence, as such instruction was no longer required. Because appellant did not raise the issues of whether the enhancement paragraph was sufficiently specific, or whether the previous convictions were final, in the trial court, he waived such issues. The appellate court held that appellant's life sentence under the recidivist statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.42(d) (1974) was constitutional on its face and as applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of injury to a child, under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.01. The complainant, defendant's son, suffered second and third degree burns. The physician found that the injuries were inconsistent with defendant's explanation and concluded that the child had been abused. Defendant admitted to police that he had dipped the child in a tub of hot water to punish him, but he claimed that he had not intended to injure the child and was unaware of the extreme temperature of the water. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. It was necessary for state to prove that it was defendant's conscious objective or desire to cause serious bodily injury to the child or, in the alternative, that defendant was aware that his conduct was reasonably certain to cause the resultant injury. There was sufficient circumstantial evidence on the issue of intent to support the jury's finding that defendant was aware that his conduct was reasonably certain to cause serious bodily injury. The court held that the terms &quot;disfigurement&quot; and &quot;deformity,&quot; as used in Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision of the 272nd District Court of Brazos County (Texas), which convicted appellant of aggravated rape and denied appellant's motion to disqualify the trial judge under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 200a, &sect; 5a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At appellant's trial for aggravated rape, appellant sought to disqualify the trial judge under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 200a, &sect; 5a. The motion was denied and appellant was convicted. He sought review and argued that there was insufficient evidence for his rape conviction and that the trial court erred in denying his motion to disqualify because there was no formal order of assignment from the presiding judge. The appellate court affirmed appellant's conviction and determined that under &sect; 5a, it made no difference if the judge of the trial court to which assignment was made was presiding over the transferring trial court at the same time. The appellate court held that there was evidence of the victim's forcible abduction, as well as testimony showing that a rape had been committed, and therefore the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed appellant's conviction for aggravated rape because the fact that appellant gave a different account of the rape incident did not render the state's evidence insufficient and there was sufficient evidence to have found appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and appellant failed to show that the assignment of his case to another trial judge was made improperly and not pursuant to all statutory requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff judge appealed from an adverse summary judgment rendered by a Texas trial court in his libel action against defendants, newspaper and staff writer, after a trial which resulted in a mistrial when the jury was unable to reach a verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff judge brought an action for libel against defendants, newspaper and writer, for their publication of an article accusing plaintiff of engaging in political gamesmanship by selecting a biased grand jury to influence the outcome of a probe into missing funds from the county attorney's office, and implying that plaintiff violated the law governing grand jury appointments by selecting not only the grand jury commissioners but also the members making up the jury panel. Plaintiff sought actual and punitive damages. After a trial at which the jury was unable to arrive at a verdict and the judge ordered a mistrial, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted largely on the basis of defendant writer's affidavit that she believed what she wrote to be true. The court on appeal reversed and remanded, finding that the record was not devoid of any genuine issues of fact, accepting as true the proof offered by plaintiff and making every inference in plaintiff's favor as required on review of a grant of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment and remanded for a new trial on the merits of plaintiff judge's libel claims, finding that summary judgment should not have been granted based on defendant writer's affidavit attempting to establish the absence of actual malice and that the record raised genuine issues of fact when the court made every inference in the non-movant plaintiff's favor.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13-10(e), a penal ordinance prohibiting construction, operation, and use of trench burners within the corporate limits of the city of Austin, or within 5,000 feet thereof, and declaring them a public nuisance. The trial court made findings of fact and conclusions of law that appellant had no ongoing business within the city that which was destroyed, limited, or impaired by the ordinance; that the ordinance was a reasonable exercise by the city of its police powers; and that the construction, operation, and use of a trench burner within the corporate limits of the city constituted a nuisance in fact. In reversing and rendering judgment for appellant, the court held that continued enforcement of &sect; 13-10(e) would irreparably damage appellant's vested property rights because it was highly unlikely, due to its penal nature, that &sect; 13-10(e) would ever be tested in criminal court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to burglary of a building and was placed on probation. Thereafter, he was convicted of other crimes in other states. He violated other conditions of his probation by failing to contact his probation officer, failing to pay supervisory fees, and failing to reimburse the county for his court appointed attorney. The trial court revoked defendant's probation, and ordered him to pay restitution for extradition fees from California in the amount of $ 1,180 as a condition of any subsequent parole. The court affirmed the revocation of defendant's probation, holding that by pleading guilty, defendant made a judicial confession. The court held that a judicial confession standing alone would sustain a conviction subsequent to a guilty plea and satisfy the prerequisites of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 1.15 (1977), and a violation of one condition of probation provided sufficient cause for revocation. The court struck the order to pay restitution, holding that the record was devoid of evidence sustaining the costs of extradition and that due process required sufficient evidence to show the amount ordered by the trial court had a factual basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee retail association obtained a permanent injunction to prohibit appellant retailer from selling items on consecutive Saturdays and Sundays, pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 9001 (1984). Appellant challenged the injunction, and argued that the trial court failed to consider its affirmative defense of charitable purpose and that the statute was unconstitutionally vague in its description of the items covered by the statute. The court affirmed the injunction. The court held that there was no legal basis for a defense of charitable purposes to the prohibition of selling goods on consecutive Saturdays and Sundays when only a portion of the profit went to charity. The court held that all of the proceeds must go to charity for the sales to be excluded from the prohibition. The court distinguished the Texas statute from an Arkansas statute that had been held unconstitutionally vague and held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 9001, &sect; 1 (1984), adequately described the items for which a prohibition existed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the injunction, and held that the charitable purposes defense did not apply because appellant did not donate all of the net proceeds to charity. The court held that the statute adequately described the items which were not to be sold on consecutive Saturdays and Sundays, so the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant offender was originally indicted when the applicable law was in transition and the indictment was brought under the new law later found to be unconstitutional. The court held that the indictment was valid, stating an offense under the prior provisions; however, defendant received a penalty greater than that authorized by the prior provisions of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.04(b)(2). Defendant asserted that the court erred in denying his motion to suppress all evidence seized pursuant to the warrant utilized by the state and defendant claimed that the affidavit offered in support of the warrant failed to establish probable cause. The court held that it could not find the warrant invalid and then find that the officers were confronted with exigent circumstances depriving them of an opportunity to secure a warrant. Defendant asserted that the court should have declared a mistrial when the prosecutor injected his personal opinion into the voir dire by advising the prospective jurors of his opposition to probation in this case. The court held that the defense objection was sustained, the jury panel instructed to disregard the comment, thus the error was cured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court for further proceedings because the court found the warrant invalid and that the evidence obtained should have been suppressed, that there was no showing that the state was unprepared for trial or cause unnecessary delays, and the error caused by the prosecutor's comments had been cured.</SPAN></P>

On remand, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment denying appellant shareholders injunctive relief, holding that, although the illegality resulted from disregard of a federal statute, it was not sufficient without proof that a lower tax would be due under a proper assessment. The court noted that the use of the &quot;equity capital formula&quot; to compute and assess value was contrary to 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 742 because it took into account the federal obligations held by appellant banks. However, the Supreme Court did not hold that the Texas statute, Tex. Tax.-Gen. Ann. art. 7166 (1960), imposing the tax on bank shares was unconstitutional. The court held that the market value of the shares was the only proper basis for assessment and found that appellant shareholders had failed to establish substantial injury entitling them to injunctive relief. However, in accordance with the Supreme Court's opinion, the trial court's judgment was modified and declaratory relief was granted.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and found that the criminal appellate court found that &sect;&sect; 6.03, 19.07 were constitutional. The court also found that &sect; 19.07 only required that appellee state prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant should have been aware of the substantial and unjustifiable risk of appellant's conduct and not that appellant actually perceived the risk. The burden was met by sufficient circumstantial evidence that appellant sped through a residential neighborhood, and not by a presumption in &sect; 19.07. The court also held that the information did not have to plead the exact terminology of &sect; 19.07 to apprise appellant of the charges. The jury instructions were correct because whether there was an accident or contributory negligence was not a defense to &sect; 19.07 and lack of voluntary conduct was not supported by the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the County Criminal Court, Harris County, Texas, following his conviction of obscenity in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(c)(1) (1981). Defendant claimed that an instruction to the jury which included the language of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.34(e) was reversible error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a police officer entered an adult bookstore where defendant worked as a cashier, and observed numerous magazines depicting sexually oriented acts on their covers, the officer purchased a magazine, obtained an arrest warrant, and arrested defendant several days later. At defendant's trial for obscenity in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(c)(1) (1981), an instruction was given to the jury containing the exact language of Tex. Penal Code &sect; 43.23(e) (1981), to wit: A person who promoted obscene material or possessed the same with intent to promote it in the course of his business was presumed to do so with knowledge of its content and character. In reversing defendant's conviction, the court found that this instruction was reversible error because the material in question were magazines which were afforded the protection of free speech under both U.S. Const. amend. I and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court also found that the state's reliance on the constitutionality of &sect; 43.23(e) was reasonable and therefore, the state had the right to retry defendant and to present any evidence that it may have withheld at the initial trial based on this reliance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's obscenity conviction, as it was error to give a jury instruction which included a presumption on intent in an obscenity case dealing with magazines, where the material was protected by freedom of speech, guaranteed by both the U.S. and Texas constitutions. Because the state's reliance on the constitutionality of the statute containing the presumption was reasonable, the state had the right to retry the defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, county appraisal district and its board of review, denied appellee public utility's application for exemption from ad valorem taxation of its property. Appellee claimed that it was exempt under Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 11.18 (1984) as a &quot;charitable organization.&quot; Appellee sought review from appellants' administrative decision. Appellants filed an answer and a cross-petition for declaratory judgment, alleging that &sect; 11.18 exceeded its constitutional authority by creating the exemption for properties of organizations like appellee. The trial court found in favor of appellee and declined to rule on appellants' cross-petition. The court on appeal reversed, holding that appellee failed to meet its burden to establish that it met all the requirements for the tax exemption under &sect; 11.18 by allowing its members to realize private gain through the sale of their memberships at a premium, and by failing to provide for a direct transfer of its assets upon discontinuance to a charitable organization as defined under I.R.C. &sect; 501(c)(3) (1954), as amended.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a probationer, was arrested for three offenses and returned to the trial court, which imposed additional probation conditions.

At the revocation proceeding, the state was permitted to prove appellant's probation record through a record authenticated under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 3737e (1984). Appellant challenged the judgment revoking his probation, claiming that use of an authenticated business record violated his rights of confrontation and cross-examination and that use of the three offenses as grounds to revoke probation after the imposition of additional conditions of probation placed him in double jeopardy. The court affirmed the judgment because it held that the authenticated records were so trustworthy as to guarantee the same protection afforded by confrontation and cross-examination and that the protection against double jeopardy did not apply to the revocation of probation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed her case without prejudice, on the basis that she failed to exhaust her statutory remedy provided by the Texas Catastrophe Property Insurance Pool Act, Tex. Ins.

The court disagreed, finding that the issue on appeal was the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court. Where a cause of action and its remedy were derived from statute, the statutory provisions must be complied with or the action was not maintainable. Here, appellant brought suit in the district court before initiating a proceeding at the State Board of Insurance, and, thus, failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.

The trial court dismissed the actions on the ground that it did not have jurisdiction. On appeal, the court reversed the dismissals and remanded the cause. The court held that even though plaintiffs did not name the state board as a defendant, the trial court had jurisdiction over plaintiffs' actions whether the actions on the insurance contracts were inherently common law causes of action or whether they were purely statutory in character. The court held that the timely filing of the actions against defendant tolled the running of the 30 day limitation period for purposes of correcting a defect of parties. The court ruled that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-13a, &sect; 19 (1984), and Tex. Ins. Code Ann. arts. 21.49, &sect; 9 and 1.04(f), could not be interpreted to mean that the naming of the state board as a defendant was a jurisdictional element of plaintiffs' actions without violating Tex.

The court found that the face of the instrument set forth in plain and intelligible language sufficient information to enable the accused to prepare a defense. The court also rejected appellant's other contention that the statute meant that a bet had to be made between two or more persons other than appellant.

Ann. art. 1269m &sect; 18 to set aside an order from the Civil Service Commission (commission) indefinitely suspending, that is, firing, him from the police department for striking an arrestee in custody. The trial court held that there was substantial evidence to affirm the commission's order. Appellant contended, among other things, that the trial court had erred in holding that the order of the commission, which upheld appellant's indefinite suspension, was supported by substantial evidence. The court affirmed. The trial court heard and considered evidence to determine whether reasonable support for the administrative order existed. The agency itself was the primary fact-finding body, and the question to be determined by the trial court was strictly one of law. The record was sufficient to withstand a &quot;substantial evidence&quot; attack. Reasonable minds, discounting the &quot;self defense&quot; version of the episode in favor of other witness' testimony, could also have reached the commission's conclusion. Under the applicable standard of review, nothing further was required.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's claim that the notice provisions of Tex. Prob.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The day after the parties' father died, appellee, the father's son, applied to probate his father's will that disinherited appellants, the father's daughters, and to be executor of his father's estate pursuant to the will. Appellee provided the only notice of his application by posting notice in the county courthouse pursuant to Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 128(a) (1980), and the trial court signed an order probating the will and appointing appellee. Appellants filed a motion to set aside the order and for a new trial, but the motion was overruled by operation of law. On appeal, the court held that because appellants did not serve the state attorney general pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2524-1, &sect; 11 (1965), they waived their claim that Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 128 was unconstitutional. The court held that the posted notice was sufficient because probate proceedings were in rem proceedings that bound all persons, and that appellants due process rights were not violated by not being served because they still could contest the will under Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 93 (1980). Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant raised numerous arguments in appeal of a prostitution conviction.

The court held that appellant did not object to the jury charge, and preserved nothing for review. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to show that appellant offered or agreed to sexual conduct for a fee. The court rejected arguments that the prostitution statute was unconstitutional by holding that any incidental restriction of free expression was no greater that necessary to further a substantial government interest in protecting citizens' health and safety and that the statute was not vague. It was argued that appellant could not be convicted through the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice to the offense, the police officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment from the 277th Judicial District Court of Williamson County (Texas) that convicted him of marihuana possession under &sect; 4.051(b)(4) of the Texas Controlled Substances Act, 1981 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 268. Appellant claimed that his trial was beyond the time limit in the Texas Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02 (Supp. 1984), the marihuana was found illegally, and his guilty plea was involuntary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer climbed over a locked fence in order to reach appellant's marihuana field, which was not visible from the road. As a result, appellant was convicted upon his guilty plea of possession of marihuana under &sect; 4.051(b)(4) of the Texas Controlled Substances Act, 1981 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 268. On appeal, the court held that the fenced area was not part of appellant's protected curtilage and that property rights against trespass were irrelevant to U.S. Const. amend. IV. Thus, the search was valid under the open fields doctrine. Because appellee, the state, filed a statement of readiness for trial within the time limit of the Texas Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02 (Supp. 1984), appellant's speedy trial rights were not violated although the trial was not held within the time limit. Because appellant received the minimum sentence for either a third degree or a second degree felony, he was not harmed when the trial court admonished him under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.13(1) (Supp. 1984) on the punishment range for a second degree felony when appellant's crime was a third degree felony. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction for marihuana possession. The court held that the readiness of appellee, the state, for trial within the statutory time limit made appellant's trial speedy regardless of the trial date, the search of the marihuana field was valid under the open field doctrine despite the fence, and the trial court's inaccurate admonishment on the punishment range was harmless and did not make appellant's guilty plea involuntary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment from the Jefferson County (Texas) trial court that convicted him of dispensing a controlled substance without a medical reason under the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect;&sect; 3.02(g) and 4.08(a)(1) (Supp. 1984).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an ophthalmologist who had weight control and drug treatment clinics, was convicted of unlawfully dispensing a controlled substance without a valid medical reason in violation of the Texas Controlled Substances Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect;&sect; 3.02(g) and 4.08(a)(1) (Supp. 1984). On appeal, the court held that the recent amendments to the Act expressly proscribed appellant's conduct and that the indictment tracked the language of the statute. Thus, the indictment was not defective. Because there was nothing in the record to show what evidence was suppressed, and because appellant objected to witnesses' testimony before, but not after, the expected objectionable testimony was given, appellant did not preserve the issues on whether the suppressed evidence and the testimony were improperly admitted. Because the use of a copy of the videotape of a reporter's interview with appellant, rather than the original videotape, was introduced only at the punishment phase and did not contribute to the punishment, any error in its admission was harmless. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction for dispensing a controlled substance without a medical reason. The court held that the statute proscribed appellant's conduct, that the indictment properly tracked the statutory language, that appellant's failure to identify suppressed evidence or to object to testimony after it was made precluded review of their admission, and that admission of a videotape copy did not affect the conviction or the punishment.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed conviction and remanded with instructions to dismiss the indictment. The trial court erred in overruling appellant's motion to quash the indictment. It was obvious that the trial court permitted the jury to convict appellant for actual delivery, either by his own conduct or as a party to actual delivery. Nowhere was the jury authorized to convict under the theory alleged in the indictment: constructive delivery. The manner and means of such transfer were not alleged. Appellant was left to guess or assume that appellee state was going to prove one or all of the types of conduct that would in legal, not statutory, construction constitute constructive transfer. An indictment on its face had to charge the offense in plain and intelligible words so as to enable a person of common understanding to know what was meant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant appealed a judgment from the 286th District Court, Hockley County, Texas, that convicted him of delivery of more than four ounces and less than five pounds of marihuana under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.05(a) (Supp. 1982) and assessed punishment at three years confinement in the penitentiary under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.05(b)(4) (Supp. 1982) and Tex. Penal Code &sect; 12.33 (1974).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of delivery of more than four ounces and less than five pounds of marihuana, in violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.05(a). On appeal, the court noted that the bill amending art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.05(a) was found to be unconstitutional. Although the three-year sentence assessed was still within the range for either the pre- or post-amendment version of the statute, appellant was entitled to a new trial because the jury was erroneously instructed that the maximum punishment was greater than the law allowed and it assessed more than the minimum punishment available under a correct instruction. Appellant was not entitled to a limiting instruction on extraneous evidence, because he first placed the extraneous offenses into evidence. Two missing ounces from the quantity of marihuana did not break the chain of custody and preclude the admission of the remaining amount. The trial court did not err in refusing to permit appellant to question the officer on missing amounts from other seizures. It was remote from any significant issue in the case and would only distract the jury. The conviction was reversed and the case remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant's conviction for delivery of marihuana and remanded to the trial court, because a bill elevating appellant's offense to a second-degree felony was found to be unconstitutional, and the jury was thus erroneously instructed that the maximum punishment was greater than the law allowed and it assessed more than the minimum punishment available under a correct instruction.</SPAN></P>

Appellant husband alleged that &sect; 3.01 violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV in that it offered no judicial protection for the institution of marriage. The court affirmed the trial court decision, thereby rejecting appellant's argument. The court found that the parties had been living apart and supporting themselves for 22 months before the divorce was granted. Appellee testified that the marriage had become insupportable and that there was no hope they could get back together. Appellant asserted that so long as one of the parties to the marriage was willing to work on resolving all problems until reconciliation was achieved, the divorce should not be granted. The court found that the fact appellant was willing to work at reconciliation did not mean there was a reasonable expectation that it would occur. The court held that the trial judge had sufficient evidence before him to determine that the statutory requirements for no fault divorce were met, and he did not abuse his discretion in granting the divorce.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to ten years in the Texas Department of Corrections. Appellant asserted that the action of the trial court in allowing the state to prove his probation record through the use of business records was error, in that the failure to have a witness with first-hand knowledge denied him his right of confrontation in cross-examination of the witnesses against him. The court held that the probation record was of such trustworthiness as to guarantee the same protection provided by the rights of confrontation and cross-examination. Appellant also asserted that it was error to revoke his probation for failure to report in that he had no driver's license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, next of kin, challenged the order of the 152nd District Court of Harris County (Texas), which granted summary judgment to appellees, port authority and three employees, under the doctrine of sovereign immunity pursuant to the Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-19, in a wrongful death action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, next of kin, brought an action against appellees, port authority and three employees, based on the deaths of their relatives while working for appellees. The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of appellees, holding that they were immune under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The court rejected the argument that the Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-19 (act) violated the constitutional right to equal protection of the law. The court found no suspect class or fundamental right in the action, and the act met the test of being rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. The court found that Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 26, which provided that any person who committed homicide was liable for exemplary damages, did not support the action. Construing art. XVI, &sect; 26 under the common law at the time it was adopted, the court found that the provision was not a waiver of sovereign immunity. Immunity was not impliedly waived by subsequent legislation because a waiver could only be made by unambiguous language. An argument that appellees were exercising proprietary functions failed because appellees performed only governmental functions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a physician, performed medical procedures on the victim, for which she paid in cash. Although defendant submitted health insurance claims for the victim and received full payment in insurance checks, he refused to remit the proceeds to her. He was charged with, and convicted of, having misapplied fiduciary property over $ 200.00 in value, and he appealed. The court affirmed the conviction. The court rejected defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict, finding that the testimony of the victim and defendant's office staff, whom defendant had asked to lie for him, adequately supported the verdict. The court rejected a claim that certain expert testimony was improper because the grounds urged on appeal were not those raised at trial. The court also rejected defense arguments concerning evidentiary rulings and sustained the lower court's rulings concerning proposed jury charges. The court found no merit in defendant's constitutional challenge to the governing statute because the court found that the statute gave fair notice of proscribed conduct, as well as finding no merit in a constitutional challenge to the sentence as cruel and unusual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxing authority imposed property taxes on land owned by appellee church group, and used by it for a retreat center. Appellee paid the taxes under protest, and asked for an appraisal review board hearing.

Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, and Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 11.20 (1982), because the land actually was used for religious worship. Appellant sought review, and the court reversed and remanded. Although the court rejected appellant's claim that the definition of &quot;religious worship&quot; was unconstitutionally broad, the court agreed with appellant that the lower court erred in its submission of special issues to the jury. First, the lower court failed to include both statutory prongs of the statutory test, which required &quot;regular use&quot; and &quot;primary use.&quot; Second, the lower court incorrectly used the name of the retreat center instead of the name of the property owner in other special submissions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital challenged a trial court judgment in a medical malpractice action brought by appellees, a widow and her child. In the action, appellees alleged professional negligence by appellant and its doctor caused the death of her husband and their father. Appellant hospital had filed a cross-action against its doctor. Prior to trial, the doctor stipulated his liability. A jury found appellant liable and awarded damages. The trial court granted appellees' motion for judgment and entered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict, holding appellant and its doctor jointly and severally liable. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to limit damages based on its ruling that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 11.02 (1984), was unconstitutional. The appellate court disagreed and affirmed the judgment, holding that the statute's limitation of recovery failed to provide adequate compensation to litigants such as appellee with meritorious wrongful death claims.

Appellees claimed that the application of the rules against them and not appellant impaired their legal rights and threatened application of the rule, as required for &sect; 12 claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant livestock shows filed a motion to dismiss their appeal of a decision from the District Court of Travis County, 53rd Judicial District (Texas) on the grounds that such appeal was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant livestock shows initiated an action for declaratory relief alleging that the Texas Animal Health Commission's rules regarding bovine brucellosis applied to appellee. Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment contending that the rules were unenforceable and invalid. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee finding that the rules were unconstitutional. Appellants challenged the decision. The rules were then expressly repealed and new rules were simultaneously adopted, so appellants filed a motion to dismiss their appeal as moot. On appeal, the court granted appellants' motion to dismiss. It would be a useless act for the court to affirm or reverse the trial court's decision because the administrative rules, upon which the decision was made, were no longer in existence. Appellants no longer needed to know whether the former rules were valid and applicable to appellee because the rules were specifically repealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted appellant livestock shows' motion to dismiss because the appeal was moot. The appeal was based upon a decision, which found that certain rules regarding animal disease control were unconstitutional. The rules were expressly repealed, so that there was no justiciable controversy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant daughters challenged an order from the probate court of Eastland County (Texas) that denied a motion to set aside an order admitting a will to probate and for new trial and that appointed appellee son independent executor of their father's will.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent executed a new will that specifically excluded appellant daughters, left everything to appellee son, and appointed appellee independent executor. Appellee gave notice of probating the will, solely, by posting at the county courthouse as provided by Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 128(a) (1980). The court affirmed the order that denied appellants' motion to set aside an order to probate decedent's will, for new trial, and that appointed appellee independent executor. There was no error committed when appellants' request for additional findings of fact and conclusions of law were refused, which related only to evidentiary issues, conflicted with the original findings and conclusions, or had no supporting evidence. The refusal to set aside the order of probate and to grant a new trial was not an abuse of discretion where appellants failed to allege a willingness to reimburse appellee for reasonable expenses that could be incurred. Thus, appellants failed to show that appellee would not have been injured by such order. Due process was satisfied by appellee's posting notice of the application for probate, when the will was produced, without personal notice to appellants.</SPAN></P>

The court held that under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.13(c), the primary focus of admonishment was on substantial compliance by the court and not harmless error. The court held that state's offer to proceed on the lesser included offense and to recommend the minimum punishment of imprisonment for five years was generous and that the generosity of the offer and advisability of accepting the offer and pleading guilty was underscored by the erroneous admonishment concerning the punishment range.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that when the state of Texas issued a certificate of title under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 6687-1 (Supp. 1984), it did not warrant title to the vehicle in the person named on the certificate. Thus, appellant was not entitled to rely on the information stated on the certificate of title. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion to bring a cross-action against the state of Texas because the cross-motion faced the legal hurdles of res judicata and sovereign immunity. Further, appellant's cross-action involve facts preceding appellant's transaction with appellee, namely the issuance of the certificate of title.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 581-4(F) (1984), was not unconstitutional vague because although the phrase, &quot;material fact&quot; in art. 581-4(F) was not elaborated upon by the statute, when considered in conjunction with art. 581-29(C)(1), which proscribed the use of fraud in the sales of securities, and when considered in light of the common understanding and practices in selling securities, a seller of securities would have been well aware that his three prior felony theft convictions, as was the case here, were material facts required to be disclosed to a prospective purchaser of the securities. The court found that although the revocation of appellant's probation pursuant to his three theft convictions was on appeal, appellant was not relieved of the duty to disclose his convictions to prospective purchasers because until that appeal was determined his probation still existed.</SPAN></P>

Based on a jury finding that the land was used as a place of worship, the trial court held that the property was tax exempt. Appellant sought review, asserting that the legislature's definition of worship was unconstitutional because it was overly broad. The court held that the definition set forth in Tex. Tax.

The court found that the evidence established that part of the land was used only to further the atmosphere of the rustic hill country, and was thus, not a place of worship. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment regarding that portion of the land being used as a place of worship, but reversed that portion of the judgment that provided for tax exempt status for the portion of property that was not being used for worship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers observed a car parked in a dark stall of a car wash.

The court found that the officers took swift action predicated upon on-the-spot observations as permitted under the guidance of Terry, and overruled appellant's point of error. The court also found that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict and that the jury's verdict was not coerced by an Allen charge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bail bond surety sought review of a decision by the 186th District Court of Bexar County (Texas), which granted remittitur to appellant in the amount of 85 percent of the bond appellant had issued for defendant, rather than the amount appellant requested under Tex. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 2372p-3, &sect; 13(b) (1984) of at least 95 percent, after having forfeited the entire bond for defendant's failure to appear.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After forfeiting a bail bond, appellant bail bond surety filed a request for a remittitur of at least 95 percent of the bond amount pursuant to Tex. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 2372p-3, &sect; 13(b) (1984), but the trial court denied his request and granted 85 percent remittitur instead. The court affirmed and found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a smaller remittitur than required under &sect; 13(b) because &sect; 13(b) was an unconstitutional infringement on judicial power. The court found that Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 and Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 8 gave the judicial branch power over bail bond forfeitures and that the judiciary's power over bail bond forfeitures historically involved its exercise of discretion. The court held that the 95 percent minimum remittitur requirement of &sect; 13(b) usurped that discretion over bail bond forfeitures in violation of Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 because it violated the separation of the judiciary from the legislature, and therefore the minimum mandatory remittitur infringed upon the judiciary's function. The court held that &sect; 13(b) was unconstitutional insofar as it set a mandatory minimum percent for bail bond remittiturs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed because the Texas constitution gave the judicial branch the power over bail bond forfeitures, which historically involved discretion, and the legislature's usurpation of that discretion by setting the mandatory bail bond remittitur of at least 95 percent violated the Texas constitution. The statutory minimum mandatory remittitur infringed upon the judiciary's function.</SPAN></P>

Later, the state filed a motion to revoke appellant's probation, in which the state alleged that appellant had violated the law by having engaged in sexual abuse of a child. The court revoked appellant's probation. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the statute under which he was charged and alleged that that statute violated U.S. Const. amend XIV, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3(a) because it limited the promiscuity defense to heterosexual conduct. The child involved in the incident was of the same sex as the defendant. The court affirmed the judgment of the district court and held that the evidence was insufficient to support a promiscuity defense even if the appellant had been involved in heterosexual conduct, and appellant was without standing to challenge the statute's constitutionality on a sexual preference basis. The court found that the child was not shown to have engaged promiscuously in sexual intercourse.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded to the trial court for a new trial under the prior statute, Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 602 (1925). The court found &sect; 25.05 denied defendant due process protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19 because it allowed the trial court to charge the jury on both the elements of the offense and defendant's affirmative defense. The court found that the instructions were inherently contradictory and denied defendant due process because it shifted the burden of disproving an element of the offense to defendant. The court held that both the state and defendant could not carry the burden of proof regarding a single issue because it could confuse the jury and fail to accord due consideration to evidential matters relating to the affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant promisee challenged the judgment from the 157th District Court of Harris County (Texas), which granted appellee executrix's motion to dismiss, striking appellant's pleadings and abating the action to collect on a series of promissory notes executed by the deceased. Appellant contended that the district court had original jurisdiction over the suit and, alternatively, that the motion was untimely filed and, therefore, waived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court abated appellant's promisee's action in favor of appellee executrix. After a motion for rehearing, appellant contended that the district court had original jurisdiction over her litigation regarding the promissory notes that she sought to collect on from appellee executrix, who administered the deceased promisor's estate. In a substitute opinion, the court held that once the jurisdiction of the statutory probate court had attached and was adequate to grant the requested relief, the district court should have refrained from exercising its concurrent jurisdiction. Contrary to appellant's contention, the suit was definitely appertaining to or incident to an estate since it necessarily involved the assets of the estate. The court found that probate proceedings had been instituted in statutory probate court before the suit was filed in the district court and that the statutory probate court had subject matter jurisdiction over the cause of action. The court found that the plea was timely. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court. Appellant was incorrect about the jurisdiction of the district court, because proceedings had been instituted in statutory probate court before her suit was filed in the district court, so the statutory probate court had subject matter jurisdiction. The district court did not err when it abated the action in favor of appellee executrix.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of delivery of more than 400 grams of cocaine. The court remanded the case for resentencing because appellant was eligible for probation and received the minimum sentence permitted by law. The court held that the drug itself corroborated the offer to sell because it tended to connect appellant with the offense and made the testimony of the offeree, a police officer, more likely true than not. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the substance delivered was cocaine. The court found that the trial court did not err in considering the testimony of a chemist because the chemist was qualified as an expert witness and performed several tests that established that the substance was cocaine. The court determined that appellant was convicted under a valid statute that made delivery of cocaine a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a period of 5 to 99 years or life.</SPAN></P>

The court held that under art. 44.02, defendant could not appeal his conviction because he had pled guilty to the offense, personally agreed to the plea bargain, and the punishment did not exceed the state recommendation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner sought review of a declaratory judgment from the 38th District Court, Zavala County, Texas, that rendered a verdict to appellee county after a bench trial, whereby appellant sought to enjoin appellee from interfering with appellant's attempt to close a purported private road, used by the public for more than 65 years, that ran through its property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner sought a declaration that a road running through its property was a private road and sought to restrain appellee county from interfering with its attempt to close the road due to vandalism losses. The trial court found that the subject road, which ran approximately one and one-half miles, had been used by the public since 1911; and, therefore, entered judgment in favor of appellee, but did not issue findings of fact or conclusions of law. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment and overruled appellant's points of error. The court initially rejected appellant's contention that the trial court erred by not making findings of fact and conclusions of law because appellant, in failing to comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 296 and 297, waived its rights to complain of any such omission. On the controlling issues, the court held that the evidence established that the public had used the road since 1911, and that appellee had maintained the road since about that time. As such, there was an implied public dedication of the road, which Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6812h (1982-83) did not prohibit, since that statute was enacted after the road became public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The declaratory judgment, in appellee county's favor, of appellant landowner's declaratory judgment action was affirmed, and appellant's 21 points of error were overruled, because there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court's implied finding that, at the time of the lawsuit, the subject road had become a public road by implied dedication.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also denied defendant's counterclaim for foreclosure of the lien. Defendant held that it's lien was valid and the trial court's judgment was therefore improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff deed holder and an individual were tenants in common of rental real estate. Plaintiff obtained a judgment against the individual and bought the individual's one-half interest in the property at the sale under execution. Defendant creditor obtained a judgment against the individual that was the tenant in common with plaintiff. Defendant's judgment was dated approximately three weeks before plaintiff received the deed to the property. Plaintiff filed suit to remove the cloud of the defendant's judgment lien from the property and defendant countersued for foreclosure. The trial court decreed a removal of the cloud and denied defendant's foreclosure. The court held that nowhere did the index reflect the names of plaintiff and defendant entered in the opposite columns, as statutorily required in the abstract. Therefore, neither the abstract nor the indexation complied with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 5447 and 5448. The court held that no lien was created because the abstract of judgment was not properly filed and it was the proper registry of the abstract of judgment that would have created the lien. The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged the grant of summary judgment to appellee retailers and judgment that the Texas Blue Law was unconstitutional. The court reversed the judgment and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. The only evidence offered by appellees was an expert's affidavit on the statute's effect on the Texas economy. The court held that the summary judgment evidence was insufficient as it failed to sustain as a matter of law the trial court's conclusions that the selection of merchandise regulated by the statute was arbitrary and capricious; that mere regulation of the sale of certain merchandise under the statute bore no rational relation to the promotion of a day of rest and failed to provide the Texas retail work force with a day of rest; and that the statute discriminated against retailers who sold merchandise regulated by the statute. The court found that the affidavit contained speculative statements, conclusions, and hearsay which were insufficient to support summary judgment and that the study's exclusion of merchants with fewer than 10 employees contradicted appellees' assertion that the study reflected the universe of retail establishments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with one count each of knowingly possessing a package of imported Speckled Sea Trout and a package of imported redfish, which contents were not identified as required by Tex. Parks &amp; Wild. Code Ann. &sect; 66.201(h) (1984). Defendant was also charged with refusing to allow inspection of aquatic products in the possession of a wholesale fish dealer under Tex. Parks &amp; Wild. Code Ann. &sect; 47.037 (1976) and was assessed a fine and sentenced to 30 days in jail by the trial court. The court reversed. The court held that Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35, was not applicable since the caption to &sect; 66.201(h) was not an attempt to amend the statute and re-enacted without being published at length when amended. The court further held that Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 36, was not violated as the caption to the statute gave fair notice regarding the matters and penalties included therein. The court, however, concluded that defendant was denied reasonably effective assistance of trial counsel as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. VI, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Tex. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before her death, a patient filed suit for medical malpractice against appellees, physician and other treatment providers. Appellees were granted summary judgment due to the limitations statute, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (1984). Appellant administratrix continued the decedent's challenge. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that appellant's claim was barred by the limitations statute. The court rejected appellant's contention that the limitation period began running when the decedent suffered &quot;legally cognizable damage&quot; as there was no basis in the record for the assertion that the injury did not occur earlier. The court interpreted art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 to mean that the limitations would begin to run from the date of the occurrence of a tort or breach or the date of the treatment's completion. The court held that &quot;breach&quot; or &quot;tort&quot; were used designate the act or omission on which the claim was founded, rather than the accrual of a right to a judicial remedy, because using the occurrence of a more readily ascertainable act or omission clarified the determination of the time from which the limitations began running on a health care claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment, finding that the limitations statute barred the medical malpractice claim of appellant administratrix because notice of the claim was given more than two years after the completion of the treatment and more than two years from any breach of duty on the part of appellees, physician and other treatment providers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the County Court at Law, Comal County, Texas, which denied his motion to dismiss and to quash the complaint on speedy trial grounds and that the speeding statute was unconstitutional, and convicted defendant for speeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of speeding after he was charged with driving 72 miles per hour in a 55 miles per hour speed zone. Defendant appealed his conviction because he contended he was denied a speedy trial and the statute on which the conviction was based was unconstitutional. The court affirmed and held that defendant had waived his speedy trial motion by filing the motion and then failing to pursue it. The court found that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 6701d, &sect;&sect; 166 and 169B allow the State Highway Commission to set speed limits that were reasonable and prudent for the state and to consider certain enumerated factors in setting those limits. One of the factors permitted was the loss of federal highway funds if the speed limit was set above 55 miles per hour. Defendant challenged this economic factor as not rationally related to public safety considerations, and therefore not rationally connected to a reasonable and prudent speed, making his conviction a due process violation. The court, however, found that safety considerations were not the only reasonable and prudent considerations contemplated by the statutes, but other considerations were part of the public welfare as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because defendant filed but never pursued his motion for a speedy trial, thereby waiving the motion, and the presumption that defendant's speed in excess of the posted speed limit was unreasonable and imprudent did not infringe upon defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in its judgment that a deadly weapon, a handgun, was used and exhibited during the commission of the offense. On appeal, the court reformed and corrected the judgment by deleting the trial court's finding that a deadly weapon was used and exhibited during the commission of the offense. As reformed, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that evidence revealed that four men conspired to burglarize a home, that appellant entered the home for that purpose, and that the victim was shot during the burglary. The court found evidence of appellant's guilt connecting him with the commission of the crime. The court held that the trial court found that a handgun was used and exhibited during the commission of the offense, but not by appellant. The trial court erred in this finding because the jury was the exclusive judge of the facts, but the error was harmless because the finding did not activate any penalty provoking provisions against appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant was convicted and fined for manufacturing methamphetamine, he appealed arguing that (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction; (2) the Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 403(d)(1) (Supp. 1982-1983) was unconstitutional; and (3) the search was invalid. Based upon a written stipulation of the evidence, the court found that an emergency existed, thus the officer's entry into appellant's apartment was authorized, and the search was valid. Further, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to support appellant's conviction, and nothing was presented for review with regard to appellant's last ground of error. However, the court concluded that the imposition of a fine in this case was improper, therefore the judgment was reformed. Accordingly, as reformed, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore the court held that the trial court erroneously charged the jury as to the patent offensiveness of the alleged &quot;representation of actual or simulated acts of oral sodomy and sexual intercourse,&quot; thereby assuming and instructing the jury as to a requisite element of the offense.

Appellants sought review of the convictions. Appellants contended that their convictions must be reversed because the trial court instructed the jury that it could assess punishment of up to 99 years or life imprisonment in the Texas Department of Corrections and a fine of up to $ 10,000. Appellants argued that they were illegally punished under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.032(d)(2) because that section was added to art. 4476-15 by legislation which was declared unconstitutional. Appellants were convicted under a conspiracy statute that derived its penalty provision directly from the house bill that had been declared unconstitutional. Under these facts, the court had to reverse appellants' convictions and remand for a new trial. Because the house bill was invalid, any punishment assessed under the bill was invalid as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant association challenged a decision from the District Court of Williamson County, 26th Judicial District (Texas), rendering judgment non obstante veredicto in favor of appellee school district, in appellant's action seeking a declaratory judgment to determine whether any part of certain real property qualified for exemption from ad valorem taxes under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7150, &sect; 2a and Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 11.19, 11.20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court, in an ad valorem tax suit, rendered judgment non obstante veredicto in favor of appellee school district. Appellant association's suit sought a declaratory judgment to determine whether all or any part of certain real property, a ranch, qualified for exemption from ad valorem taxes. The trial court ruled that several special issues answered favorably to appellant were either immaterial or unsupported by the evidence. The trial court decreed that the ranch was not exempt from taxation under neither Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7150, &sect; 2a nor Tex. Tax. Code Ann. &sect; 11.19, 11.20. On appeal, appellant contended that the trial court erred in disregarding the jury's answers to special issues and in failing to render a judgment in its favor. The court found that the trial court erred in holding that none of the land in question was tax exempt for years 1977-79; and in ordering that appellee recover judgment for taxes assessed against the property for 1977-79. The court overruled appellant's contention that the trial court erred in failing to render judgment that the entire ranch was tax exempt for 1980 under &sect; 11.19. The court otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reformed the judgment of the trial court that appellant association's property was not exempt from taxation; the property was exempt from ad valorem taxation during the years 1977-79, and a portion of the property was exempt from ad valorem taxation from January 1, 1980 until the trial's conclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the County Criminal Court at Law No. 7 of Harris County (Texas), in which he was convicted of possession with intent to sell of a dildo, an obscene device under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(c)(1) (1977). Appellant contended that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 43.23(a) and 43.23(c)(1) (1977) both were unconstitutional as violative of the right to privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, appellant asserted that he was entitled to reversal because his conviction under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(c)(1) (1977) was invalid as a violation of the right to privacy guaranteed under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and as an example of the excessive use of police power under the Texas Constitution. The appellate court rejected appellant's assignments of error and affirmed, holding that the right of citizens to possess obscene materials in their homes did not create a right to sell that material publicly. The appellate court accordingly found that the legislature had not exceeded its police power mandate in making commercial distribution of dildoes, defined as a obscene device, a criminal offense. The appellate court concluded that neither of the statutory provisions cited by appellant were unconstitutional, noting that there was no need to prove whether appellee state had a compelling state interest in banning the sale of such obscene devices because appellee had a long recognized legitimate interest in regulating the use of obscene material in local commerce and in places of public accommodation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed appellant's conviction, finding that appellant, despite having a right to possess obscene materials in his own home, had no constitutionally protected right to make a commercial sale of sexual devices properly determined to be obscene. Appellee state had a legitimate interest in regulating the commercial distribution of obscene material in public places.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court affirmed the conviction. The court ruled that although House Bill 730 was unconstitutional, the prior act remained in full force and effect. Thus, under the prior act, possession of cocaine was an offense, and appellant's punishment was within the prior act's punishment range. The court found that the trial court did not err by accepting appellant's nolo contendere plea, because there was nothing in the record that showed that appellant entered his plea in reliance upon any defined agreement with the trial court giving him a right to appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of delivery of an amount of marihuana weighing five pounds or less but more than four ounces. Prior to sentencing, the trial court instructed the jury that because the current conviction was of a second-degree felony and appellant had previously been convicted of a felony, the jury could assess punishment as that of a first-degree felony, namely, confinement for life or for any term of not more than 99 years or less than five years. Thereafter, the jury assessed punishment at confinement for 15 years. Appellant then sought review, regarding the trial court's instruction. On review, the court, in view of case precedent, reversed and remanded the cause for a new trial. The court found that the jury was incorrectly instructed in regard to the minimum range of punishment and that such instruction was reversible error. The court noted that the offense constituted a third-degree felony and that, applying the prior conviction, the range of punishment for the offense was that specified for a second-degree felony, that is, confinement for a term of not more than 20 years or less than two years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were charged with intentionally and knowingly causing game roosters to fight in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.11(a)(6). The trial court denied their petition for habeas corpus relief and refused to discontinue their prosecution. On review, appellants claimed that &sect; 42.11(a)(6) did not prohibit cockfighting because the statute referred to animals, not fowl, and that it was otherwise was unconstitutionally vague. The court reviewed various revisions to the penal code statutes regarding animal cruelty and found that the revisions merely consolidated many scattered statutes into a workable scheme that was enacted to protect animals. The court held that for purposes of &sect; 42.11(a)(6), the term &quot;animal&quot; included fowl. The court also held that &sect; 42.11(a)(6) was not unconstitutionally vague because the term &quot;animal&quot; as defined in &sect; 42.11 and the phrase &quot;causing one animal to fight with another&quot; were clear and unambiguous.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation brought an action for a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief and for damages caused by appellee municipality when it denied a specific use permit for property that appellant wanted to lease for a group home. The trial court held that appellant lacked standing to sue and the court affirmed. The court found that zoning determinations relate solely to real estate and its use and not to who owns or intends to occupy it. One had to have a legal right that was breached to have standing to seek redress for an injury.

Appellant also claimed that it was entitled to bring suit as a person injured under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5547-300, &sect; 3(26). The court held that the statute clearly restricted recovery to mentally retarded persons and to those entitled to bring suit in their behalf pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The punishment was five years confinement. At issue on appeal was the conviction's validity under the Controlled Substances Act, as amended by House Bill 730, 67th Leg., 1981, ch. 268.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possession of methaqualone with intent to deliver. The punishment was five years confinement. Appellant challenged the validity of a conviction under the Controlled Substances Act as amended by House Bill 730, 67th Leg., 1981, Ch. 268. The court affirmed the conviction, but remanded for appropriate punishment. Methaqualone was listed in Penalty Group 3, pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.02(d)(2) (1982-1983). Under H.B. 730 such was punishable by life or any lesser term and a fine. On motion of the state, the charge was reduced as to the amount of the substance possessed, which was still an aggravated offense punishable by life or any lesser term and a lower fine. H.B. 730 was unconstitutional, but the Controlled Substances Act should have stood as though H.B. 730 had never been enacted. Prior to the passage of H.B. 730, possession of such substance with intent to deliver was a felony, and possession alone was a Class A misdemeanor. The allegation of the indictment was sufficient to allege the misdemeanor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of promoting obscenity and appealed his conviction arguing that the trial court erred in denying his request for a statement of facts due to his inability to pay. Appellant also argued insufficiency of the evidence as well as the constitutionality of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21 and &sect; 43.23 (1974). The court noted that the trial court had ample evidence upon which to base its denial of his petition for indigent status. The court noted that he made sufficient money to pay his legal fees and that the appeal was actually being pursued by appellant's employer. The court also found that, without the statement of facts they had to assume that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict and the finding that the material depicted simulated sexual intercourse and sodomy. The court further held that the actual jury instruction given to the jury tracked the wording of appellant's request, therefore he could not later argue error. The court finally held that the word &quot;decency&quot; actually stated a common meaning of what governed current community standards and therefore the statute was constitutional. The court then affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Appellees contended that the statute was unconstitutional and could not shield appellants from liability for violating the requirements of the Motor Carrier Act. The trial court held that the statute was unconstitutional and violated provisions of the Texas Motor Carrier Act. On appeal, the court held that in its view the title of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a judgment that declared appellant's park land dedication ordinance unconstitutional as a violation of Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17. The ordinance's stated purpose was to provide recreational areas in the form of neighborhood parks as a function of subdivision development. Appellee real estate developer elected to pay monies in lieu of dedicating the required amount of land. The court affirmed, holding that the ordinance unquestionably sanctioned an unconstitutional taking of private property for public use. Appellant was a home rule city that enjoyed full power of self government and enabling statutes operated only as limitations to that authority. The court held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1175, &sect; 15, specified the procedure for exercising power and it did not allow appellant to acquire land for parks under its police power. The parks did not benefit the general public and did not bear a substantial relation to the safety and health of the community under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1175. The ordinance violated Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17, because it required a dedication of land, or money paid in lieu thereof, as a prerequisite to plat approval.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed his conviction on insufficient evidence grounds and remanded his case with instructions to enter an order of acquittal. The prosecution arose when one of appellant's business checks bounced, and it was revealed that appellant used that account for both personal and business expenses. The court held that appellee state government had failed to prove that appellant knew that certain checks used by appellant for private purposes came out of funds earmarked for workers and construction materials. In addition, appellee failed to prove that certain payments made by appellant were unrelated to the construction project itself. Since it was appellee's burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant acted with the intent of defrauding others, its evidence was legally insufficient.

The court found that because appellant's claim was not timely presented within the meaning of Tex. Prob.

Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The reviewing court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness and that it is not so indefinite so as to deprive a person of due process of law. The statute was written clearly, in precise and definite terms and aptly described what instruments constituted illegal knives. The statutory language was easily comprehendible and a person of ordinary intelligence had adequate notice of what conduct was proscribed by the statute. Defendant's ignorance of the law did not excuse his violation. Defendant's contention that a police officer's testimony as to prior trouble with appellant constituted evidence of an extraneous offense was without merit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the County Criminal Court No. 5 of Tarrant County (Texas), which found defendant guilty by a jury of driving while intoxicated, in violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701L-1(b) (Supp. 1984). The court assessed punishment at 30 days confinement and a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of driving while intoxicated, and defendant appealed. The appellate court reversed and remanded because defendant was improperly denied a limited right to counsel prior to making a decision as to whether to take an intoxilyzer examination. The court found that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701L-1(a)(2)(B) (Supp. 1984)was not an impermissible conclusive presumption that violated the federal or state constitutions. The statute did not violate the &quot;fair notice&quot; standard, and was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. However, the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the results of an intoxilyzer test which was administered after appellant had requested and been denied the presence of counsel. The court found that the error was clearly not harmless, and mandated reversal. The court thereafter examined defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence because a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, if sustained, barred a retrial. However, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction for driving while intoxicated, without regard to the evidence concerning the challenged intoxilyzer test results.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for driving while intoxicated was reversed and remanded because defendant was improperly denied a limited right to counsel prior to making a decision as to whether to take an intoxilyzer examination. There was a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction or affected the punishment assessed, therefore, the error was not harmless, and mandated reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother challenged a judgment from a District Court of Dallas County (Texas) that granted defendant father summary judgment in plaintiff's suit to establish the parent-child relationship between her son and defendant. The trial court determined that plaintiff's suit was time barred under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.01 (1982-1983). Plaintiff claimed that the four-year limitation period of &sect; 13.01 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother appealed a judgment that, based upon the four-year limitation period under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.01 (1982-1983), granted defendant father summary judgment and dismissed as time-bared plaintiff's paternity action. The court reversed the judgment. The court ruled that the limitation period under &sect; 13.01, as that statute existed at the time of plaintiff's suit, was unconstitutional. The court observed that two requirements had to be satisfied: (1) the period for obtaining support granted by Texas to illegitimate children had to be sufficiently long in duration to present a reasonable opportunity for those with an interest in such children to assert claims on their behalf, and; (2) any time limitation placed on that opportunity had to be substantially related to the state's interest in avoiding the litigation of stale or fraudulent claims. The court ruled that neither test was satisfied. The four-year period was arbitrary and insufficient. Moreover, the court reasoned, the fact that &sect; 13.01 was amended to permit a much longer limitation period was evidence that the state's valid interest was not necessarily defeated by a limitations period longer than four years.</SPAN></P>

The statutory four-year limitation period applicable to plaintiff's suit was unconstitutional because it was an insufficient period of time to enable a party such as plaintiff to present a claim on behalf of the child.

On appeal, the issue was whether Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The court agreed with appellant's contention and held that the Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

Subsequently, appellant began providing care in her home to a child unrelated to either appellant or her husband. Appellant provided such care. The trial court granted appellee's application for a permanent injunction enjoining appellant from operating a child-care facility. Upon appellant's challenge, the court reversed, on an unassigned error, because the pleadings referred to licensing requirements whereas registered family homes were exempt from licensing requirements. The supreme court reversed and remanded. On remand the court affirmed the permanent injunction, finding Tex. Hum. Res.

Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (Supp. 1982), within two years of discovery, or the statute was unconstitutional as applied in her suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee doctor performed a tubal ligation on appellant patient in 1977.

Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (Supp. 1982). The court ruled that &sect; 10.01 was unambiguous, and no allowance was made for the judicially created discovery rule exception. The court also rejected appellant's claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to her, under the 14th Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 13 and 19. The court concluded that there was a reasonable basis for the classification created by the statute and a legitimate state interest in the matter. The court noted that appellant's suit was filed more than two years after appellee could have been guilty of malpractice, and was therefore barred by &sect; 10.01.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court held that the jury imposed a sentence based upon its findings and imposed neither the maximum nor the minimum punishment authorized by the charge, but instead weighted the evidence and arrived at an appropriate sentence for the offense committed.

Additionally, appellant asserted that the trial court erred in finding significant expenditures by appellee in reliance on the license's continuance, and in declaring that the equipment installed on appellants' property should remain appellee's property. The court held that irrevocability based on reliance rests upon equitable estoppel which is particularly supportable when a licensor has joined in the enterprise with licensee and accepts the benefits of licensee's labor and expenditures. Further, the court held that property affixed to the realty of another remained the licensee's personal property and did not become part of the realty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the 63rd District Court of Val Verde County (Texas), which convicted him of delivery of marihuana for remuneration and assessed punishment at four years of confinement and a fine.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of delivery of marihuana for remuneration, and received a punishment of four years of confinement and a fine. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, and held that there was no error in the jury charge on punishment. The court held that appellant waived all but fundamental error in the charge because appellant made no objection to the charge and did not submit a requested charge. The court found that although the trial court gave an incomplete listing of the conditions of probation under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 6 (1982-1983), the jury was informed of the proper range of punishment under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.05(d)(e) (1976). The court also found that the trial court properly instructed the jury that probation could be granted in certain circumstances under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 3a (1982-1983). The court determined that the trial court's charge as a whole did not contain any fundamental error, adequately protected appellant's rights, and did not deny a fair and impartial trial under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 36.19 (1981).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for possession of heroin in violation of the Texas Controlled Substances Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15 (1976). In light of a recent decision handed down by the criminal appeals court, the court was compelled to examine the constitutionality of the Act upon appellant's conviction. The court held that the constitutionality of the amendment to the Act did not render appellant's conviction invalid because at the time when appellant committed the crime there was a valid statute in effect, which made it a criminal offense to possess heroin regardless of the amount. The court held that there were sufficient circumstances that affirmatively linked appellant to the contraband, and established more than a mere suspicion of his unlawful possession of the contraband. The court held that the evidence was sufficient that a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of possession of heroin beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the evidence was also sufficient in establishing appellant's knowledge of the substance in the cloth pouch was contraband. The court affirmed appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment enjoining appellant from further violation of art. 9001. The court concluded that the evidence established as a matter of law that appellant violated the statute by selling home furniture items on consecutive days of Saturday and Sunday. Appellant testified that he owned a furniture company and that his stores was open on consecutive days prohibited under the statute. The court concluded that appellant failed to establish the defense of selective prosecution since he failed to show that he was singled out for selective prosecution, which others similarly situated and committing the same acts had not. Appellant also failed to establish that such discriminatory selection for prosecution had been invidious or in bad faith by resting upon such impermissible considerations as race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of three counts of felony theft of property, alleged in a single indictment. The charges arose when his checks for the purchase of three pieces of farm equipment at an auction were returned unpaid. The court reformed the judgment and sentence and, as reformed, affirmed. The court held that it had jurisdiction over the appeal and that the appellate scheme, which became effective after appellant filed his notice of appeal, was not an ex post facto law. The court found that the evidence supported the conviction on count one because appellant's intent was presumed upon proof that he acquired the property by issuing a check, he did not have funds on deposit to pay the check in full, he had notice of the bank's dishonor, and he did not pay the holder after notification of its dishonor. The court held that in a prosecution for offenses arising out of a single transaction, a conviction could be had on only one count. The multiple convictions did not void the judgment, which was reformed by reversing the convictions on counts two and three.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and wife were tried together for possession of cocaine under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. &sect; 4476-15, and both were convicted after a jury trial. On appeal, defendant argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney, who represented both defendants, had a conflict of interest. He also argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction because the state failed to submit any evidence on the amount of cocaine that he allegedly possessed, and that this was an essential element of the crime. In affirming the judgment, the court found that because defendant had not objected to his counsel at trial, he needed to show an actual conflict of interest which adversely affected his attorney's performance. The court found that defendant failed to meet this burden, and that under the totality of the circumstances, he received reasonably effective assistance which was all that was required. With regard to the amount of cocaine needed for conviction, the court noted that the portion of the statute relied on by defendant had been declared unconstitutional, and thus the previous statute, which made mere possession a crime, was applicable.</SPAN></P>

Defendants allegedly made loud verbal utterances during the speech. Defendants were convicted, and the court affirmed the convictions.

The court found that defendants presented nothing for review on the constitutional challenges and further had no standing to assert that &sect; 42.05 was unconstitutional as applied to imaginary third persons. The court found that &sect; 42.05 was applied narrowly and required specific criminal intent so it was not facially vague and had no chilling effect on constitutional freedoms.

Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 61.71(a)(6), 61.77 (1978). Defendant contended that &sect; 61.71(a)(6) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad when applied in a criminal context because neither the phrase &quot;shows evidence of intoxication&quot; nor the word &quot;intoxication&quot; was defined in &sect; 61.71(a)(6) or elsewhere in the code. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that the phrase &quot;showing evidence of intoxication&quot; within &sect; 61.71(a)(6) was not unconstitutionally vague because it was sufficiently clear that men of ordinary intelligence did not need to guess at its meaning or be in doubt as to what conduct was prohibited. The court held that &sect; 61.71(a)(6) was not overbroad because it penalized conduct and not inactivity or status and did not intrude into constitutionally protected conduct by banning sales to persons to whom one should reasonably be entitled to sell.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.05(c) (1982). Subsequent to appellant's conviction art. 4476-15 was declared unconstitutional because it failed to apprise readers of the changes effected by its amendments. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that, although art. 4476-15 was unconstitutional, no reversible error was shown because the penalty imposed on appellant was within the range of the pre-amendment statute. The court found that there sufficient evidence that appellant delivered marijuana because he made arrangements with an undercover officer to meet, showed the marijuana which was in his trunk to the officer, and attempted to collect money from the officer before the arrest was made. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order a new trial because there was conflicting evidence as to whether a juror's passing remark about her personal knowledge about the weight of marijuana was received by the other jurors and was detrimental to appellant.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the covenant did not impose a limit on the number of units which could be placed on a tract. The court found that testimony by homeowners that they understood the covenant to prohibit multi-unit dwellings was not uncontroverted evidence of the intent of the grantor of the covenant and need not be considered because the covenant was unambiguous.

Appellant also argued that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress evidence on the grounds that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 52.01 deprived juveniles equal protection of the law. The court affirmed appellant's conviction for murder because the photograph of the victim's body was not gruesome and it clarified expert testimony, there was no evidence that appellant's confession was not given freely and voluntarily, and that portion of the Family Code allowing custody of a juvenile without an arrest warrant was constitutional. The court stated that although &sect; Tex. Fam.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Initially indicted for felony theft of property, defendant accepted a plea bargain to misdemeanor theft of property.

A district court judge later signed a final judgment adopting all of the magistrate's rulings, except no mention was made of the matter of probation. Appellant challenged the conviction, contending that the tribunal which conducted the hearing and entered the judgment against appellant was improperly constituted in violation of the Texas Constitution. The court reversed the judgment of the district court and held that under the Texas Constitution only the district court judge held the judicial power to make a final decision on whether appellant should be placed on probation pursuant to Tex.

The trial court found that appellants' claim was barred by the statute of limitations, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (1982-1983).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was tried and convicted of possession of heroin. Appellant alleged that his conviction was unconstitutional because the caption of House Bill No. 730, which amended the Controlled Substances Act, failed to meet the requirement of Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and overruled appellant's exception because the indictment alleged possession of a quantity of heroin which was an offense under the law as it existed before H.B. 730 was passed and the sentence imposed was within the range allowed. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the substance was &quot;unlawfully&quot; possessed because the evidence clearly demonstrated that the appellant exercised actual care, custody and control over the heroin in his pocket, thus establishing that he possessed it as that term was defined by Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1.07 (28) (1974). The court further concluded that the search warrant under which the evidence was seized was lawful because the informant personally saw heroin within appellant's residence and the informant had given reliable information in the past regarding narcotic traffic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15 (1976) of the Texas Controlled Substances Act, for delivery of less than twenty-eight grams of the controlled substance methamphetamine, and the trial court assessed punishment at 14 years imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that the unconstitutionality of the 1981 amendatory act of the Texas Controlled Substances Act did not render the conviction invalid, as the original act under which defendant committed the offense remained in full force and effect. The court further held that when defendant took the stand to support his application for probation, he waived his U.S. Const. amend. V privilege against self-incrimination, that specific acts of misconduct by the accused which did not result in final conviction generally were not admissible, but that a court would be reluctant to exclude otherwise legally admissible evidence relevant to the determination of an accused's application for probation, and that the trial court was under no duty to announce his finding of guilt prior to the presentation of evidence on punishment.</SPAN></P>

During appellant's trial, the prosecutor was permitted, over objection, to ask appellant about money found on his person at the time of his arrest. Appellant objected to the question as eliciting extraneous offense testimony. On appeal, appellant challenged application of the unconstitutional act to his case, asserted that the prosecutor's question regarding money in appellant's possession at the time of arrest was irrelevant, and contended it was error for the trial court to refuse to consolidate two offenses arising out of the same criminal episode. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that appellant was properly convicted under a controlling pre-amendment version of the act. The court noted that appellant did not preserve error regarding the prosecution's question since the objection raised at trial differed from the one raised on appeal, and the court found nothing in the record to substantiate a second offense.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that art. 5167 created no right in appellants to receive overtime pay, and further held that art. 5167a was constitutional. The court ruled that appellants' statements in their summary judgment affidavit that they possibly would have been discharged if they refused to work non-emergency overtime and that their careers might suffer were not competent summary judgment evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant seller challenged a decision from the 224th District Court of Bexar County (Texas) that granted a partial summary judgment for appellee buyer, finding as a matter of law that a breach of warranty of title had been established.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant seller challenged the constitutionality of the Texas Certificate of Title Act when applied in conjunction with breach of warranty provisions of the Texas Business and Commerce Code. A used vehicle was sold to appellant, who then sold it to appellee buyer. The vehicle was confiscated by the State Department of Public Safety as a stolen vehicle, the theft having occurred prior to the transactions with appellant. Appellee brought an action against appellant following the confiscation. The trial court granted a partial summary judgment, finding as a matter of law that a breach of warranty of title had been established. By trial amendment appellant raised the constitutional issues presented in the appeal and sought indemnity against the state for its wrongful and negligent acts. It was a settled rule that a purchaser of property from one who had acquired possession by theft acquired no title. Appellant was unable to transfer good title to appellee despite appellant's compliance with the Certificate of Title Act. Although appellant acted innocently, he purchased stolen vehicles and was unable to acquire good title. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to a charge of delivery of a controlled substance, and a jury assessed punishment of a ten-year term of incarceration. He challenged the judgment of conviction and sentence, arguing that the trial court erred in improperly restricting the closing argument of appellant's counsel and in denying his motion for mistrial when the prosecution referred to an extraneous offense. In affirming, the appellate court concluded that where the record established no unconstitutional restriction of appellant's closing argument and did not reflect what appellant's counsel would have argued if he had not been so restricted, appellant failed to demonstrate harmful error. The appellate court likewise rejected appellant's contention that he was entitled to a mistrial when the prosecution improperly referred to an extraneous offense by using the term &quot;drug dealing.&quot; Where appellant pled guilty to delivery of a controlled substance, he admitted to dealing in an illegal drug. As such, the prosecution was entitled to characterize his activity as drug dealing, and such characterization was not improper.</SPAN></P>

The state charged relator with violation of the &quot;Blue Law.&quot; Relator contended that the &quot;Blue Law&quot; infringed upon relator's right to equal protection under U.S. Const. amend.

The trial court rejected relator's habeas corpus challenge to the constitutionality of the statute and denied relator habeas corpus relief. The court affirmed. The court found that the criminal nature of the &quot;Blue Law&quot; provisions invoked did not justify strict scrutiny of the statute. The court held that the proper standard was the minimum scrutiny of the rational relation test because the &quot;Blue Law&quot; did not intrude on fundamental rights and produced no adverse consequence particularly visited upon and recognized suspect category.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for possession of heroin in violation of the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, in its form as amended by the legislature in 1981, entered in the Criminal District Court No. 4, Tarrant County, Texas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for possession of heroin under the Texas Controlled Substances Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15 (1976), following an incident in which police officers found heroin residue on the floor of appellant's car and heroin capsules in the possession of appellant's wife, a passenger in the car. Appellant alleged insufficient evidence to prove knowing and intentional possession of heroin. Appellant also alleged that because the state did not prove the quantity of heroin in appellant's possession, only a conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia was proper. The court affirmed, finding that evidence that appellant was the driver and owner of the vehicle in which the heroin was found was sufficient to support an inference that appellant was knowingly and intentionally in possession of heroin. The quantity of heroin possessed by appellant was sufficient to support the conviction because mere evidence of heroin residue was a violation under the statute. The court held that although the 1981 amendment to the Act under which appellant was convicted was declared unconstitutional, appellant's conviction was still valid under the original unamended Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting appellant of possession of heroin under the Texas controlled substances statute was affirmed because evidence that appellant was the owner and driver of the car in which the heroin was found was sufficient to support an inference that appellant knowingly and intentionally possessed the substance. Appellant's conviction was not invalid due to the unconstitutionality of the amended act under which he was convicted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant estate administratrix brought actions for wrongful death and personal injuries on behalf of decedent's estate. The probate court dismissed both causes of action for want of jurisdiction, and appellant sought review. The court found that a cause of action for personal injuries survived the death of the injured party and could be asserted by the heirs or administrator on behalf of the estate. A cause of action for personal injuries was an asset of the estate, and therefore the probate court had jurisdiction to determine the status of that asset, as meritorious vel non, as a matter incident to the estate. However, a wrongful death action was a cause of action separate and distinct from a survival cause of action, although both arise from the same transaction, and a wrongful death cause of action was not an asset of the estate. Accordingly, the court reversed that part of the trial court's order dismissing the survival cause of action but affirmed that part of the order dismissing the wrongful death cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of engaging in organized criminal activity in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 71.02(a)(1) (1983). Appellant sought review of his conviction and the court affirmed. The court determined that, in an indictment for engaging in organized criminal activity, it was not necessary to specifically identify the manner and means of committing the underlying offense. The court found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad because it did not prohibit constitutionally protected conduct and gave notice of the point at which incidental assistance of an activity became a conspiracy to commit an act prohibited by the statute. The court also found that the punishment scheme under the statute was rationally related to the conduct it addressed. Finally, the court concluded that the general rule that a person be prosecuted under a specific statute rather than a general one was not applicable when the general statute was enacted after the specific statute.</SPAN></P>

After a non-jury trial, the court found appellant guilty of promotion of obscene material, and assessed a fine. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal. The court found that the state produced no evidence showing that appellant knew the content and character of the film. The court apparently agreed with appellant's argument that there was no evidence that he was on the premises when the film was exhibited, and that his mere presence on the premises after the offense and his position as alleged manager were not culpatory evidence. The court that noted that the presumption under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(e) (1982-1983) that a person charged with promotion of obscene material had knowledge of the film's content and character had been held unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found defendant guilty and assessed his punishment, enhanced by one prior felony conviction, at 10 years confinement. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction because the indictment alleged the elements of possession of a controlled substance, namely heroin, proscribed by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect;&sect; 4.02(b)(2), 4.04(a)(b) and was sufficient to allege defendant's unlawful conduct. The court also stated that the evidence demonstrated that defendant exercised actual care, custody, and control over the heroin in his pocket, thus establishing that he possessed it within the meaning of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1.07(28) (1974). Next, the court stated that the recitation of an informant's personal observation of heroin within the residence satisfied the first prong of a test. The second prong of the test was fulfilled by the recitation that the affiant received information from a credible and reliable person who gave information in the past regarding narcotic traffic that proved true and correct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of theft and assessed 180 days in jail pursuant to a plea agreement. Appellant argued that the tribunal which conducted the hearing and entered judgment was in violation of the Constitution of Texas, because appellant's application for probation was heard and denied solely by a magistrate appointed under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1918c. The court reversed and remanded and held that art. 1918c was unconstitutional as applied to appellant. The court held that a magistrate was no more than a surrogate for the district court, that art. 1918c did not create a magistrate's court, and merely authorized a procedure whereby the duly constituted district court may dispose of matters before it. The court held that judicial decisions involving the ends of justice and the best interests of the public and defendant required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.13, &sect; 3 could not be left to a surrogate under Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 1.

On appeal, the court held that because the evidence showed that several acts of rape were committed by one continuous act of force and threats, state was not required to elect which specific act of rape upon which it relied. The court held that the trial court properly allowed identification testimony after concluding that the pre-trial display of photographs was not impermissibly suggestive. The court held that state's use of peremptory challenges to exclude venireman with Mexican-American surnames was not a systematic exclusion. The court held that Tex.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.05(a)3, even though it omitted the statutory phrase &quot;occurring in the presence of the victim&quot; in the portion relating to acts of force and threat. The court held that the trial court's charge, which only abstractly charged on the law of parties did not deny appellants a fair trial because the evidence was sufficient to sustain their conviction as primary actors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In December, 1977, appellees, doctors and nurses, allegedly left a surgical sponge in appellant patient's abdomen after surgery. The date of last examination or treatment by any appellee was January, 1978. Appellant filed suit in October, 1980. The trial court granted the appellees summary judgment on the ground that the suit was barred by the two-year statute of limitations under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590I, &sect; 10.01 (Supp.1982). Appellant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that summary judgment was correct under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (Supp.1982), because appellant did not file his suit within two years of the date of last treatment by any appellee. The court held that &sect; 10.01, was an &quot;absolute&quot; statute of limitations. As such, it was unmodified by the &quot;discovery rule,&quot; which, if applicable, would have tolled the statute of limitations until appellant discovered the allegedly negligent treatment by appellees. The court also held that the legislative title of &sect; 10.01, was not unconstitutionally insufficient because it gave reasonable notice of its contents to an average legislator or interested citizen.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of appellees, doctors and nurses, because appellant patient did not file his suit within two years of the date of the alleged negligent treatment or the date of last treatment by any of appellees. The legislative title of the applicable statute of limitations was sufficient to give reasonable notice of its contents and was thus constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, former owners, challenged a judgment from the 151st District Court of Harris County (Texas) in favor of appellee purchaser. Appellants claimed that the jury erred in awarding possession of land to appellee under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 33.54 because retroactive application of this statute was unconstitutional, or, in the alternative, because appellants fell within the savings clause in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7345b-3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee purchaser brought suit against appellants, former owners, to establish his right to land he inherited from his brother who obtained it at a tax sale. The jury awarded title to the property to appellee, and appellants sought review. They claimed that appellee's tax deed alone did not establish his title to property because Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7345b-3 and its successor, Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 33.54, were unconstitutional if applied retroactively. In the alternative, appellants claimed they fell within the savings clause in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7345b-3. The court held that art. 7345b-3 and &sect; 33.54 were constitutional and did not bridge any substantive rights because they were procedural in nature. It found that one appellant had asserted a defense to appellee's claim within the three year period in art. 7345b-3(b), so he was entitled to have appellee prove appellee's trespass to try title action. The court reversed on this part of the trial court's judgment, but it also affirmed in part, overruling points of error raised by other appellant who had not brought a cause of action or asserted a defense within the period in art. 7345b-3(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment pertaining to one appellant, former owner, who asserted a defense to appellee purchaser's claim to title to land within the savings period. The court affirmed the part of the judgment as to other appellant, former owner, who had not asserted a defense within the savings period. Because the limitations statute was procedural, it did not take away vested rights and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of possession of a controlled substance, methamphetamine, weighing less than 28 grams by aggregate weight. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the evidence was sufficient to show that the substance was methamphetamine, as alleged in the indictment, where a chemist testified that the substance was methamphetamine, which was 34 percent pure and weighed 1.70 grams, and that methamphetamine in its pure form was a non-stable liquid, which must be combined with some kind of a stabilizing agent to convert it to a powder. The evidence was also sufficient to prove that defendant knowingly exercised care, custody, and control of the methamphetamine where police officers found defendant kneeling next to a flushing commode, with two packets of powder by his feet. The court held that defendant's conviction was not based on an unconstitutional statute because the caption to the amendment to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15 (1982-83) provided adequate notice, as required by Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated possession of less than 2000 but more than 200 pounds of marijuana and was sentenced by the jury to 15 years imprisonment. Defendant appealed challenging the admissibility and sufficiency of the evidence. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded for a new trial. The court found that defendant was charged after an amendment to the Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.051 (1982) which was held unconstitutional and void under Tex. Const. Ann. art. III, &sect; 35 (1955), for lack of adequate notice of the charges. Also, defendant's punishment was assessed as excessive and was, therefore, not authorized by statute. Further, the court held, from the totality of circumstances, that the affidavit supporting the warrant to search defendant's firm was based on probable cause. Additionally, the court held, based on the totality of the evidence and the reasonable inferences, that the evidence was sufficient to support conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of a district court of Hunt County (Texas), which convicted him of burglary of a building.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following appellant's conviction for burglary of a building, he challenged the decision. The court affirmed. First, the trial court did not err by failing to quash the jury venire because appellant does not cite any portion of the record in support of the alleged error and failed to demonstrate purposeful and systematic exclusion of a cognizable group. Second, the trial court properly instructed the jury because the requirement of a circumstantial evidence charge had been abolished and appellant failed to present evidence that if he was guilty, he was guilty only of a lesser included offense. Third, the trial court's communication with the jury did not amount to additional instructions, and the application portion of the trial court's charge limited theories of convictions to those plead in the indictment, thus there was no fundamental error. Fifth, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that appellant entered the building with the intent to commit theft. And finally, the use of penitentiary packets and the testimony of a fingerprint expert to prove appellant was the person twice before convicted did not deny appellant his right to cross-examination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction holding that appellant failed to demonstrate purposeful exclusion of a cognizable group from the jury pool; appellant had no right to a circumstantial evidence charge of lesser included offense charge; communication with the jury did not amount to additional instructions; and, the introduction of corrections department documents did not violate appellant's right to cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his mental health commitment that was entered in Probate Court #3 of Harris County (Texas). He argued that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a finding that he was mentally ill and required commitment in a mental hospital, that he was not afforded a probable cause hearing within a reasonable time of his detention, and that he was denied due process of law because the jury's verdict was not unanimous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant disputed his commitment to a mental hospital. The court reviewed the evidence and applicable due process standards. The court held that the testimony of his family members showed that he required hospitalization for his own welfare and protection. His behavior could result in someone acting in a violent manner toward appellant in the future, which could result in injury to himself and to others. His pre-commitment detention complied with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5547-66 (1980). He was provided the hearing as required by art. 5547-68(b). Although he did not have a probable cause hearing, he did have an opportunity to be heard and present evidence in his own behalf at the commitment hearing, which incorporated due process requirements. The remedy for failure to provide a probable cause hearing within three days of an emergency commitment was release, pending the temporary commitment hearing. The commitment process was civil, so the rules of civil procedure applied. Tex. R. Civ. P. 292 provided that a verdict could be rendered by five out of the six jurors. Further, appellant had not objected to the jury charge, so he had waived any objection. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed. The testimony of appellant's family members tended to show that he required hospitalization for his own welfare and protection and that of others.

The court revoked his probation, and imposed a six-year sentence for the previous offense and a 15-year sentence for the subsequent offense. On review, appellant challenged the constitutionality of the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.03 (1982-1983). Further, he alleged that the motion to revoke probation failed to give him sufficient notice of the offense as charged because the pleadings alleged all three means of delivery enumerated in the statute. The court affirmed noting that the state's classification scheme must merely demonstrate a rational connection with its legislative goal to be constitutional. Because the state had a legitimate interest in regulating drug possession, which was effectuated by a statutory scheme, the court overruled appellant's first grounds of error. Finally, the court held that where the state alleged each type of delivery, appellant was on notice to prepare a defense for each.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that he was constitutionally entitled to carry these weapons by U.S. Const. amend. II and Tex. Const. Art. I, &sect;23 . The court held that U.S. Const. amend. II did not contemplate granting appellant the right to carry swords upon his person in a public place in order to be prepared in case he might need them. In fact, it merely protected the rights of the states to maintained armed militia under state control. The court further held that Tex. Const. Art.

The court found that &sect;46.02 and its predecessors had been universally held constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded nolo contendere and was convicted of possession of cocaine. On appeal, the court rejected his claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his plea because the statement of facts did not show that the signed stipulation of evidence was offered. After reviewing the record, the court held that the stipulation was introduced and that the evidence was sufficient to support his plea. The court held that his nolo contendere plea waived all non-jurisdictional defects, including a claim that he was denied a speedy trial. Affirming the judgment convicting appellant, the court found his attack on the constitutionality of the Texas Controlled Substance Act unimpressive because its failure to define cocaine did not render the statute defective or too vague to prevent a determination of what conduct was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged judgment of the 205th District Court Of El Paso County, Texas, which convicted him of capital murder. Appellant alleged grounds that trial court erred in admitting the testimony of appellant's fellow county jail inmate subject to Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 38.22 and that certain evidence was produced by an allegedly invalid arrest of and invalid search while out of state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder after being stopped and arrested in California for violation of San Francisco Municipal Code Section 1291(b), carrying a prohibited weapon, searched incident thereto, and returned to Texas pursuant to the outstanding murder warrant. Appellant challenged conviction on grounds that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of appellant's fellow county jail inmate, and that various items of evidence produced by the allegedly invalid California arrest and search of his belongings. Affirming, the court held that where fellow inmate was not acting as an agent of law enforcement personnel at the time he received appellant's confession, the confession was not the product of custodial interrogation and was not subject to Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 38.22. Further, although the state failed to establish probable cause for the California arrest, emphasizing that appellant relied solely on federal constitutional grounds, no prophylactic purpose was served by applying an exclusionary rule where it would not serve to dissuade improper police conduct in California.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the capital murder conviction because appellant's fellow inmate was not acting as an agent of law enforcement when appellant allegedly confessed to him and the confession was therefore admissible. While the state failed to establish probable cause for the California arrest, the exclusionary rule was not applied where it would not serve any purpose other than to free a convicted felon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment in the 108th District Court of Potter County (Texas), entered in favor of appellee citizens based on 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city's police officer used a patrol vehicle to block appellee citizens, who were on motorcycles, from fleeing after a traffic violation, resulting in a collision. Appellees brought claims against appellant under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6252-19 (1982), and were awarded a judgment against appellant for their injuries. Appellant sought reversal of the judgment, claiming insufficient and improperly admitted evidence, erroneous jury instructions and issues, error in the award of attorney's fees and judgment interest, and immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6252-19 (1982). The court affirmed the judgment and held that the evidence showed that the officer acted pursuant to departmental policy and caused the collision with a patrol unit and a parked car. The court further found that the injuries, including one appellee losing a leg, were sufficient to justify the damage award, and under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, appellees were entitled to attorney's fees and interest, which were also supported by the evidence. The court further held appellant could not assert immunity under &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, because appellant city was liable for the use of excessive force by the officer hired by appellant city, which caused injuries to appellee citizens, and appellant could not assert immunity from appellees' federal civil rights action based on the officer complying with departmental procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision from the 258th District Court, Trinity County (Texas), convicting him under Tex. Parks &amp; Wild. Code Ann. &sect; 47.037 (1976) for refusing to allow an employee of the Department of Texas Parks and Wildlife to inspect aquatic products in his possession. Appellant asserted that &sect; 47.037 violated the U.S. Const. amend. IV and Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was approached outside of a building that he claimed was one of his residences, by a game warden who asked appellant to see his fishing license. Appellant complied with the request but refused to allow the warden to inspect his residence without a warrant. Appellant was convicted under Tex. Parks &amp; Wild. Code Ann. &sect; 47.037 (1976) for refusing to allow the game warden to inspect aquatic products in his possession. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with instructions to dismiss the prosecution. The court found that &sect; 47.037 contained no procedural safeguards. Section 47.037 gave unequivocal authorization to wardens to search and the requirement of a warrant was not even mentioned. The court held that &sect; 47.037 on its face violated the U.S. Const. amend. IV and the Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9 because it allowed a criminal prosecution of one who asserted his right not to be searched unless the search was authorized by a neutral officer who believed that probable cause for it existed. Appellant would have been afforded protection even if the building were determined to have been a business instead of a residence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded with instructions to dismiss the prosecution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with possession of less than 28 grams of cocaine and he waived a jury trial and entered a plea of guilty. The trial court found appellant guilty of possession of a controlled substance and imposed a sentence of 10 years' confinement. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

III, &sect; 35 because the caption to the enabling legislation did meet constitutional requirements concerning the drafting of legislation.

Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 21.01 et seq. (1975). The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The trial court did not err in admitting the foreign certificate and petition for child support into evidence because the documents met the requirements of Tex. Fam.

Appellant failed to make a bill of exceptions, and the court could not speculate as to whether his testimony would have raised the defense of non-paternity. Appellant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI were not violated because the right to confront witnesses only applied in a criminal prosecution. Appellant made no bill of exceptions to the trial court's refusal to allow evidence of non-access to his spouse when he attempted to raise the issue of paternity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and convicted of theft of trade secrets based upon an indictment which largely tracked the language of the statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.05. The indictment identified the property in question as &quot;architectural plans, designed and drawn by&quot; a named architect. In reversing the indictment, the court found that the crime was a broad-based one and thus, in order to meet the statutory and constitutional guarantees with respect to indictments, the state was required to include language therein which specifically identified the property in question and any other particulars relevant to the crime. Notice to defendant that he was charged with theft of &quot;architectural plans&quot; did not meet the specificity required. The court, in so ruling, noted that the record in this case was replete with information, such the structure these plans were intended for, the name of the person who bought the plans, and their identifying number.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case because the indictment tracked the language of a broad-based offense but failed to state with specificity the particulars of the crime defendant allegedly committed.

In addition, failure to define &quot;abuse&quot; or &quot;potential&quot; was not grounds for striking down the statute. The court found that the phrase &quot;having a potential for abuse associated with a stimulant effect on the central nervous system&quot; in the indictment and statute was merely a factual matter which the state had to prove, and that the phrase had an understandable meaning. The court also held that the laboratory analysis was properly admitted under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The trial court granted his application and ordered commitment to jail until he paid a fine. Defendant filed a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that no fine could be imposed without adjudication of guilt. The state filed a motion in trial court to proceed, and defendant objected because of the pendency of the habeas corpus appeal. The trial court overruled and revoked his probation. The court dismissed defendant's application for habeas corpus because it became moot upon the adjudication of guilt, conviction, and sentence. Pendency of the habeas corpus appeal did not affect the court's authority to proceed because it was not an appeal from a final judgment of conviction. The court affirmed the conviction, concluding that it could not consider the constitutionality of Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal District Court #2 of Tarrant County (Texas), which revoked her probation for failure to pay costs, probation fees, and restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a petition to revoke defendant's probation. The state subsequently waived its allegation of a new offense and proceeded to trial solely on defendant's failure to pay costs, probation fees, and restitution. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment revoking probation. The court held that defendant's inability to pay was an affirmative defense to revocation which she was required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 8(c). As she failed to raise this affirmative defense, the state was not required to prove that she had the ability to pay and intentionally failed. The court also held that the affirmative defense created by art. 42.12, &sect; 8(c) did not violate defendant's rights to due process and equal protection. The court found that the statutory scheme did not create a presumption that the probationer could pay and intentionally did not pay but merely required the probationer to come forward and explain the breach of the contract. The court held that art. 42.12, &sect; 8(c) did not violate defendant's right against self-incrimination as she could have shown her inability to pay without taking the stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction from the 187th District Court of Bexar County (Texas), for the attempted murders of an assistant district attorney, and an acquaintance of appellant, and for an aggravated assault on a bailiff, contending that the trial court erred in failing to quash the indictments for failure to specify the manner in which appellant had the specific intent to commit murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.02 (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant for the attempted murders of an assistant district attorney, and an acquaintance of appellant, and for an aggravated assault on a bailiff. On appeal, appellant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to show the weapon used to stab the bailiff was a deadly weapon. No knife was ever recovered. The court found the jury was justified, from the evidence and testimony adduced, to conclude that the same knife was used in all three stabbings, and thus that the weapon was deadly. Appellant further contended the trial court erred in failing to quash the indictments for failure to specify the manner in which appellant had the specific intent to commit murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.02 (1981). The thrust of appellant's argument was that the indictments did not put him on notice whether the state sought to prove that he intended to cause death under &sect; 19.02(a)(1) or intended to cause serious bodily injury resulting in death under &sect; 19.02(a)(2). The court held that appellant was clearly informed that the murder intended was a &sect; 19.02(a)(1) type murder because he attempted (intended) to cause the death of the complainants. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction on the grounds that appellant was clearly informed that the murder intended was in violation of a certain statute because he attempted (intended) to cause the death of the complainant. Nothing in the indictments indicated that appellant desired anything less than the deaths of the complainants when he used a knife to perform the act of stabbing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant's conviction of driving while intoxicated, finding that the trial court had failed to instruct the jury properly as to the presumption of intoxication shown through a breathalyzer test result of .10 percent or above under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 67011-5, &sect; 3(a) (1977). It held that the trial court erred in not telling the jury that the facts giving rise to the presumption had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, as required by Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 2.05 (Supp. 1982), thereby in effect telling the jury that the presumption was mandatory. Although appellant had not challenged the instruction, but based his appeal on other grounds, the court found that the erroneous instruction required reversal as a fundamental error because it deprived him of his due process rights. It remanded the case, writing that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court rendered judgment in favor of appellee ex-employee in his action against appellant plan trustees for recovery of his alleged vested percentage in the employer's contribution under a thrift plan, which percentage was forfeited by appellants because of appellee's knowing violation of a non-competition provision of the plan. On appeal, the threshold issue was whether or not appellants' failure to notify appellee to cease his competitive conduct within a prescribed period of time in violation of the terms of the plan was necessary to permit a forfeiture of the employer's contribution. The court held that strict adherence to the terms of the trust was required. It was improper to speculate whether appellee would have discontinued his competitive conduct to prevent a forfeiture. This disputed fact issue was not submitted to the jury, and since appellants had the burden of submitting this issue their failure to request such submission, or to object to its omission, waived such issue. The court found appellee was not entitled to prejudgment interest, reversed and modified the judgment to conform to the jury's verdict regarding attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers brought an action to enjoin issuance of bonds following a bond election. Appellee Progreso Independent School District filed a declaratory judgment action to have the bond election declared valid. The two actions were consolidated, and the trial court found that the election was proper in all respects and valid. Appellants sought review. The court first found that the Texas school bond election laws, in particular Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 20.04, were unconstitutional in that they prohibited those who did not own property in the district from voting on a school bond issue. The court, however, determined that it could strike the offending provisions and that, as struck, the Texas laws authorizing school bond elections were valid. The court also determined that voters were not misled by language in the bond issue concerning interest rates and that sufficient notice was given that the actual rate could be higher than initially anticipated. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed because, after striking down as unconstitutional the requirement that voters own property within the district, the Texas law authorizing school bond elections was valid, and the proposition gave adequate notice that interest rate on bonds could be higher than initially anticipated.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not err in denying appellant's motion to quash the complaint for allegedly failing to reveal the place were the event occurred. The state's pleading came well within the acceptable limits of giving appellant notice of the location where the offense allegedly occurred. Thus, appellant received all the notice to which he was entitled, and the complaint was specific enough to bar another action for the same offense. Likewise, there was no error in denying the motion to quash for failing to allege a culpable mental state because the Court of Criminal Appeals had previously rejected this claim in another decision. The court further held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 6701d, &sect;&sect; 167-169B were not unconstitutional delegations of the legislature's authority. Rather the limitations on the discretion of the State Highway and Public Transportation Commission were necessary to effect the legislature's purpose and were capable of reasonable application.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a patient and her husband, brought a suit for medical malpractice against appellee doctor. Appellee filed a plea of limitation and motion for summary judgment under Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 5.82, &sect; 4, and claimed that the action was time-barred. The trial court sustained the plea and granted summary judgment in favor of appellee. Appellant challenged the ruling and contended that the statute was unconstitutional, and that the &quot;discovery rule&quot; applied to the statute. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling and held that where appellant failed to raise the issue of the statute's constitutionality at the trial court, it was not reviewable. The court found that the limitations statute provided that an action had to be commenced within two years after it accrued, and that the courts had engrafted the &quot;discovery rule&quot; into the statute. In examining a subsequent legislative amendment to the statute, the court found that the language regarding when the cause of action &quot;accrued&quot; was deleted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Texas Department of Human Resources and appellant child filed an original petition to establish the parent-child relationship between appellee father and appellant. In his original answer, appellee asserted that appellant's cause of action was barred by limitation under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.01, as it then existed. The trial court dismissed with prejudice the cause of action as barred by the one-year statute of limitations. Timely appeal of the dismissal was perfected to the court, and the court affirmed. Timely appeal was perfected to the United States Supreme Court, which then ruled that the one-year limitation under the 1975 enactment of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.01 was unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the court's decision and judgment, and remanded the case to the court for further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion. The court then reversed and remanded for a new trial, in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cause was reversed and remanded, as the trial court's order of dismissal was based directly upon a one-year statute of limitations, and the statute was now held unconstitutional. A new trial was required, pursuant to applicable civil procedure rules. As the issue of any applicable statute of limitation in this type of action was not properly before the court in the appeal, the court declined to address it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction in the13th Judicial District Court, Navarro County (Texas) of violating the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect;&sect; 4.05(a) and (b)(4), in that he knowingly or intentionally delivered a quantity of marihuana of five pounds or less but more than four ounces.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In challenging his conviction, appellant claimed that the amendment to the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, under which he was convicted, violated Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35. The court held that the changes in &sect; 4.05 and &sect; 4.01 of art. 4476-15 by the amendment in question clearly related to offenses and criminal penalties under the Texas Controlled Substances Act, and thus were within the announced purpose of the amendatory act as set forth in its title, and they were not &quot;remote&quot; from the subject of the original act. The court affirmed, holding that notice of these changes was adequately expressed in the title of the amendatory act within the meaning and requirement of Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35 because the only changes made by the amendment that related to appellant's case changed the offense committed by appellant from a third-degree felony to a second-degree felony due to the amount of marihuana delivered, and also changed the penalty for the offense.</SPAN></P>

Appellant alleged that his retrial and conviction subjected him to double jeopardy, his punishment was unlawful, he was entitled to dismissal of his indictment under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 51.14, and &sect; 46.06(a)(4) was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a prior trial in which the jury could not reach a verdict, defendant was convicted upon a confession of guilt more than 120 days after being surrendered to Texas from another jurisdiction pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (Act). On appeal from this conviction, the court held that defendant's second and current trial did not subject him to double jeopardy because nothing in the record indicated that a new trial was granted on grounds of insufficient evidence. The court held that his punishment was authorized by law because punishment was no greater in the new trial than the punishment imposed in the first trial. Although defendant was not tried within the 120 days' time after his surrender to Texas from another jurisdiction as required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 51.14 of the Act, the court found that the parties agreed to a continuance, which was deemed necessary and reasonable. Lastly, the court held that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.06 was not unconstitutionally vague because the definition of firearm silencer was ordinary and obvious and thus reasonably understood to a person of common intelligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and punishment for possession of a firearm silencer was affirmed because he was not subjected to double jeopardy for the new trial was not issued on the basis of insufficient evidence, his punishment was authorized by law, he was not entitled to dismissal because the delay was a result of a continuance, and the offense prescribed by statute was constitutional as enacted and as applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the County Criminal Court at Law No. 8 of Harris County (Texas), which convicted appellant for promotion of obscenity, alleging the information was insufficient to put appellant on notice of the charges against him and Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(e) (Supp. 1982) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A vice-officer entered a bookstore, and purchased a magazine, which was later determined to be obscene, from appellant. Appellant challenged his conviction for promotion of obscenity. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and held the trial court did not err in refusing to quash the information because the information fairly informed appellant of the charges against him and enabled him to plead an acquittal or conviction and bar future prosecutions for the same offense. The term sodomy in the information was sufficient to put appellant on notice of the acts alleged to be obscene and an acquittal or a conviction served as an adequate bar to future prosecutions. Additionally, the information charged appellant with promotion of obscenity through the sale of the magazine and whether the magazine depicted one or more obscene representations was irrelevant to the act of promoting the material. Further, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(e) (Supp. 1982), was constitutional because the presumption that appellant knew the content and character of the material was valid and rational, as appellant worked in an adult bookstore and the covers of the magazine depicted acts of oral sodomy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction for promotion of obscenity and held the refusal to quash the information was not erroneous because the term sodomy therein fairly put appellant on notice of the charges and the statute was constitutional because the permissive presumption was rational. A jury could have found appellant knew of the content and character of the material because he worked in an adult bookstore and the magazine depicted oral sodomy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant beer manufacturer's applications to renew six licenses to distribute beer were denied by appellee Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission because Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 102.18 prohibited a licensed alcoholic beverage manufacturer from having a license to distribute alcohol. The trial court affirmed the denial. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 102.18 was constitutional because it had a reasonable basis and,even though it only applied to appellant, it was not so inflexibly fixed as to prevent its being applied to other entities or persons. The court found that a reasonable basis for &sect; 102.18 is that the public interest was served by the prohibition of vertical integration within the alcoholic beverage industry and that the law reasonably prevented industry domination by a few.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied his motion to quash the indictment and appellant was convicted of cruelty to an animal. The court affirmed the judgment and found the information was sufficient. It found that in order to prepare his defense, appellant was only required to meet the state's proof that the food provided was not sufficient in quantity and quality to sustain the horse, which information was a matter of common knowledge among persons familiar with the care of horses.

The court overruled appellant husband's ground of error because the assertion raised no defense issue in evidence. Appellant wife challenged her conviction on the ground that the information on which she was charged was fatally defective. The court found that the information was fatally defective because it omitted an essential element of the offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district sought review of a judgment of the 22nd District Court of Hays County (Texas), which declared invalid appellant's tax scheme and taxation of appellee taxpayer, a pipeline company, and ordered that appellant take nothing on its complaint for unpaid taxes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district sought to recover unpaid taxes on an interest in real estate owned by appellee taxpayer, a pipeline company. Appellee filed a general denial to the complaint. At trial, appellee presented evidence that the valuation on its properties for the tax year was grossly in excess of the fair market and assessed values, in that the valuation was at a considerably higher percentage of market value than farmland within the district. The trial court found the assessment discriminatory and invalid, and awarded appellant nothing on its complaint. Appellant challenged the judgment, asserting that the trial court erred because appellee had failed to comply with the requirements of pleading set forth in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7329, which provides the affirmative defenses available to a taxpayer. On appeal, the court agreed with appellant's assertions. The court concluded that because appellee had failed to affirmatively plead its defenses, the trial court could not enter judgment on the issues raised at trial. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for entry of judgment in the amount of the delinquent taxes plus interest and penalties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment, holding that the trial court erred in declaring the district's assessed valuation void and invalid on the basis that it was grossly in excess of that allowed by law or the basis that it resulted from a discriminatory scheme adopted by appellant school district. There being no pleading to support these affirmative defenses, and no trial by consent in that respect, the trial court could not enter judgment thereon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated robbery. Appellant alleged that the trial court erred by overruling his motion for mistrial or failing to quash the jury panel because of the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges by the state. The court affirmed appellant's conviction, finding no systematic exclusion. The court held that appellant's contention that the trial court erred in overruling his objection to continuous prejudicial remarks and arguments of state's counsel was multifarious and violated Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann, art. 40.09, &sect; 9 (1982). Appellant claimed error in permitting the state's witness to bolster his identification testimony by testimony of a pre-trial line-up identification, but the court held that a witness who had identified appellant at the trial could also testify that he identified appellant at a line-up. The court held that appellant did not object to what he claimed was an unqualified witness, so his objection was waived. The court held that the state's opening statement was proper and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the prosecuting attorney to inquire whether members of the jury panel had been victims of a crime.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(c)(1), in favor of appellee state, based on several challenges to the constitutionality of the statute as applied to his sale of tickets for, and projection of, an adult film. The court reversed and remanded, explaining because the statute attempted to hold obscenity defendants to the community norm of proper behavior and taste as opposed to the permissible minimum standard of conduct the community was willing to tolerate, the portion of the statute allowing the accused's conduct to be judged on community standards of &quot;decency&quot; was unconstitutional and had to be struck. The court determined the remainder of the statute was complete within itself and capable of being executed in accordance with legislative intent independently of the rejected portion. The court determined reversal and remand was required because the lower court was assumed to have determined the issues of patently offensive and appeal to prurient interests by use of the perspective of the average person and applying contemporary standards of decency instead of the required &quot;tolerance&quot; standard.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also concluded that &sect; 3.01 was applicable to the case, regardless of the fact that the parties were married before that statute was passed, and that the statute did not violate either the federal of state constitutions.

Ann. art. 6701h &sect; 31 and related jury charge and urging error in the admission into evidence of certain records of the Department of Public Safety (department) and a private employer as not shown to be business or public records. The court affirmed, ruling that the notice of license suspension sent to appellant pursuant to &sect; 31 conveyed the present fact of license suspension with a postponed effective date. Thus, the presumption of notice defined in &sect; 31 applied and the court had not erred in so charging the jury. The statute satisfied fundamental fairness because the presumption arose from the common experience of mailing letters and mailing and receipt were reasonably related. The records, which had been made in the regular course of the department's business, were admissible as official records. An employment application was merely cumulative of appellant's withholding exemption certificate, which was an admission of the matters it contained.</SPAN></P>

However, the court found no cases of convictions other than those in which the Texas courts had confined prosecution and conviction to situations involving commercial sex, that is an offer or agreement or actual act of sexual conduct for a fee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder, and on appeal he contended that his motion to quash the indictment should have been granted because an element of the offense was not correctly alleged.

The court rejected defendant's contentions, finding the indictment sufficiently charged defendant with shooting a peace officer in the lawful discharge of an official duty, knowing at the time that the officer was a police officer. The indictment was not void for vagueness and defendant had notice of the offense charged against him. The court held that a capital murder indictment need not allege the special issues of Tex.

The court also found the officer had specific and articulable facts which, with rational inferences, were sufficient to permit him to stop the vehicle and detain its occupants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the offense of possession of marijuana in an amount over four ounces, a felony. Defendant was given probation, and one of the conditions was that he would not be convicted of any offense. The state alleged he had committed three offenses, all possession of marijuana of less than two ounces, during his probationary period, and the trial court ordered his probation revoked. On appeal, defendant asserted that he had a constitutional right to subpoena and question the members of the grand jury which indicted him for the primary offense, the subject of the revocation hearing. The court affirmed the order of revocation. The court held defendant's challenge of the grand jury evidence was time-barred, and should have been done before trial. The court held that there was no unlawful seizure by the police of contraband dumped from the automobile by defendant and probable cause existed at that point to search him, so the evidence was admissible. The court also found that the charging instrument sufficiently apprised defendant of the required elements of the offense to which he pled guilty, so he had notice.</SPAN></P>
