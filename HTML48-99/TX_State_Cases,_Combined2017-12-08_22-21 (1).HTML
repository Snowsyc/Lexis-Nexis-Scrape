<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeals, Fifth Supreme Judicial District of Texas, Dallas County, that convicted him of desecration of a venerated object in violation of Tex. Penal Code &sect; 42.09(a)(3) when, during a political protest, he destroyed a United States flag.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review after he was convicted of desecrating the United States flag in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.09(a)(3). The court reversed and remanded the case for dismissal finding that appellant's activity was symbolic speech protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, and that &sect; 42.09(a)(3) was too broad and overly vague. The court found that the state's interests in preventing breaches of the peace and preserving the flag as a symbol of national unity were inadequate to support the statute. It reasoned that &sect; 42.09(a)(3) was so broad that it could be used to punish protected conduct which had no propensity to result in breaches of the peace. Further, the court found that the existence of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.01, which addressed the same basic interest as &sect; 42.09, but in a less restrictive manner, indicated that the legislature was aware of and able to implement an alternative to the language of &sect; 42.09. This, the court found, proved that &sect; 42.09, as it related to breaches of the peace, was too broad for U. S. Const. amend. I purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the case for dismissal holding that the burning of the United States flag was symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment and that the state statute was broad and overly vague because it punished speech that would not result in breaches of the peace and because other less restrictive statutory mechanisms were available to address the state's interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of unity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeals, Fifth Supreme Judicial District of Texas, which reversed the trial court's conviction of defendant for murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction for murder based upon the state's introduction of evidence of acts of misconduct on the part of defendant that were not final convictions. The court affirmed the reversal of defendant's conviction and remanded the case. The court held that admission of the extraneous offenses violated Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07(3), and that even if the evidence was in some way relevant, it was too prejudicial. The court held that two factors militated against the probative value of the admitted evidence: the offenses were unadjudicated and the offenses occurred before defendant's arrest for the instant offense. The court held that the probative value of an unadjudicated offense was less than that of an offense for which a defendant, by due process of law, had been convicted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision reversing the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the trial court committed reversible error in admitting evidence of five prior acts of misconduct because the introduction of unadjudicated extraneous offenses was prohibited during the punishment phase of a trial as proof of prior criminal record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of the offense of murder and punishment was assessed at 99 years imprisonment.

Appellant filed a petition for discretionary review. Appellant argued that even if the continuances granted to the state because of the absence of a witness met the broader standards of review under Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals holding that art. 38.071 &sect; 2 was not prima facie invalid under U.S. Const. amend. VI or Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant, a prisoner convicted of possession of a controlled substance, sought review by writ of habeas corpus of a decision from the trial court in Brown County (Texas), pursuant to Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 11.07. Applicant contended that the Prison Management Act, Article 6184o, V.A.C.S., was violative of the Texas and United States Constitutions as an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant prisoner sought review of the 1987 amendment to the Prison Management Act (PMA), Article 6184o, V.A.C.S., and a determination of whether the PMA was violative of the Texas or United States Constitution as an ex post facto law. According to the PMA, when the Texas Department of Corrections reached an occupancy level of 95%, certain classes of inmates automatically became eligible for a grant of 30 days administrative good time credit. The grant of good time had the effect of advancing the inmate's parole eligibility and parole review date. Eligibility for the grant was based entirely upon the statutory classification of the inmate's offense. After applicant was incarcerated, the legislature amended the PMA, and applicant was no longer eligible for the grant of good time credit. On appeal, the court granted relief. The court held that the 1987 Amendment to the PMA was retrospective, and that applicant was disadvantaged by the time he would have to serve in prison instead of being allowed the possibility of parole. The court held, therefore, that retrospective application of the 1987 Amendment was unconstitutional as an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant prisoner's writ of habeas corpus relief was granted. The court held that retroactive application of the amendment to the Prison Management Act, which changed eligibility for good time credit, to applicant's detriment, was violative of the ex post facto clause. However, the court held the decision to release or not release applicant, even though eligible for parole, remained within the sound discretion of board of pardons and paroles.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision by the Court of Appeals, Twelfth Supreme Judicial District of Texas, Nacogdoches County, which affirmed defendant's conviction for theft. The court of appeals rejected defendant's contentions that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 31.03(c)(3) and 31.03(c)(4) were unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court granted defendant's petition for discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that the presumption provided for by Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 31.03(c)(3) and 31.03(c)(4) was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Defendant alleged that the jury charge given pursuant to this provision, as mandated by Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 2.05, allowed an impermissible shifting of the burden of proof from the state by raising a conclusive and arbitrary presumption. On appeal, the court agreed with defendant. The court held that after instructing the jury that knowledge was presumed where the necessary records had not been kept, the charge here never informed the jury that it was free to reject the presumption, even upon proof of the predicate facts. The court held that because of this lack of clarity, a reasonable jury could have found the presumption here to be mandatory. The court held, therefore, that at least as it was presented to the jury in this case, the presumption deriving from &sect; 31.03(c)(3) was constitutionally defective. The court also held that the error deprived defendant of a fair trial. Accordingly, the court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and remanded the cause to the trial court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed arguing numerous errors including that the trial court erroneously denied him indigency status for purposes of securing a free transcript on appeal and that the capital murder statute pertaining to murder during commission of a burglary, &sect; 19.03(a)(2), and the burglary statute,&nbsp;&sect; 30.02(a)(3), were unconstitutional in that they both penalized the same conduct. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, holding that there was no evidence that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant indigent status because the record revealed sufficient grounds for the trial court's determination that defendant had sufficient assets to obtain the $ 9,000-$ 10,000 needed to pay for the transcript. The court noted that the record indicated that defendant owned a home worth at least forty-five thousand dollars, that he recently sold his chrome-plating shop for $ 35,000, and that he had other assets. The court further noted that the statutory crimes of capital murder and burglary penalized completely different conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought discretionary review of a decision by the Court of Appeals, Fifth Supreme Judicial District of Texas, Dallas County (Texas), which reversed defendant's conviction by jury trial of the felony offense of unlawful possession of a prohibited weapon, namely a chemical dispensing device. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.06(a)(7). The court of appeals held that &sect; 46.06(a)(7) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its request for discretionary review, the state argued that the court of appeals erred in holding a penal statute unconstitutionally vague on its face with respect to hypothetical applications without applying the statute to the defendant's conduct. The state contended that the court of appeals used the wrong analysis in finding the statute vague with respect to certain conceivable applications noting that the court did not even address the facts of the instant case. On appeal, the court agreed with the state and vacated the appellate court's decision. The court held that when challenging the constitutionality of a statute, a defendant had to show that in its operation the statute was unconstitutional to him in his situation; that it may have been unconstitutional as to others was not sufficient. The court also held that the constitutionality of a statute was not to be determined in any case unless such a determination was absolutely necessary to decide the case in which the issue was raised. The court held that the court of appeals did not use the proper analysis or standard in passing on the constitutionality of the statutes involved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During his jury trial for aggravated sexual abuse, the trial court admitted a pre-trial videotaped interview of the complainant, as authorized by Tex.

Before the appellate court, appellant asserted that the trial court's admission of the videotaped interview denied his right to confront and cross examine the witness. The appellate court decided that art. 38.071, &sect; 2, was not an unconstitutional deprivation of appellant's right of confrontation. On review, the court reversed, holding that the statute was facially unconstitutional and unconstitutional as applied to appellant under U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 because it was illogical to place appellant in the untenable position of either requiring the complainant to testify and thereby run the very real risk of incurring the wrath of the jury or forgo the right to invoke cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment of the lower court and remanded the case. The court held that before it could be determined that evidence derived from a warrantless but consensual search following an illegal arrest was admissible, it must first be found, by clear and convincing evidence, not only that the consent was voluntarily rendered, but also that due consideration of the factors of proximity of the illegal arrest to the procurement of the evidence, intervening occurrences between the illegal arrest and the acquisition of the evidence, and whether the arrest was illegal as a matter of failure to comply with technical requirements or amounted to a gross violation of legal processes, militated in favor of the conclusion that the taint had dissipated.

On appeal, the court held that peremptory strikes of several black jurors were proper and that the trial court did not error in not quashing the indictment. The court held that a witness was not established as a common law wife for purposes of the privilege against testimony and the trial court did not error by not instructing on a lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state petitioned for discretionary review of the decision of the Court of Appeals, Fifth Supreme Judicial District of Texas, which reversed defendant's conviction for driving while intoxicated. Defendant had claimed that the driver's license checkpoint where he was stopped and arrested was an impermissible pretext stop under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6687b &sect; 13, and that it violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the offense of driving while intoxicated and appealed. The lower court reversed the conviction when it determined that the driver's license checkpoint where defendant was stopped and arrested was an impermissible pretext stop under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6687b &sect; 13 and, as conducted, violated defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV. The lower court found that the trial judge erred when he failed to suppress the fruits of the roadblock seizure, and entered a judgment of acquittal. Defendant was stopped at a roadblock, asked to exit his car, and eventually arrested when the officer decided that he was intoxicated. The court found that although a roadblock established solely for determining a motorist's sobriety may be constitutionally permissible under proper circumstances, in this case, the roadblock lacked proper constitutional safeguards and operational guidelines designed to protect motorists from unreasonable seizure, and was merely a subterfuge for a general investigatory sweep of motorists in the area. The court found that defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV were violated and affirmed the decision of the lower court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the lower court that reversed defendant's conviction for driving while intoxicated. The court found that the entry of an acquittal was not the proper remedy, and modified the disposition and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state retried appellant after his original conviction for committing murder of the victim while in the course of committing or attempting to commit the felony offense of aggravated robbery was reversed. At the second trial appellant presented no witness or evidence, and he was again convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed finding that none of appellant's grounds of error rose to the level of reversible error. The court found that that the successful appeal of a judgment of conviction, on any ground other than the insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, posed no bar to further prosecution on the same charge. Therefore, the court held that the trial court had not erred by denying appellant's special plea in bar and former jeopardy because the error that occurred at appellant's former trial was &quot;trial error&quot; and not &quot;insufficiency of the evidence&quot; error. The court noted that a majority of the venirepersons had read an article about the upcoming trial, which was published in the local paper the day before jury selection commenced. Nonetheless, the court overruled the grounds of error regarding voir dire, jury selection, and venue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was granted an automatic appeal and challenged of the decision of the Galveston County trial court (Texas), which convicted him of capital murder pursuant to Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant took an automatic appeal for a conviction of capital murder pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2). Appellant challenged the voir dire proceedings and jury instructions of the trial court. The court affirmed appellant's conviction of capital murder. The court determined that the trial court properly removed a veniremember for cause because her subjective views would impair her duties as a juror. Furthermore, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion when he denied appellant's challenge for cause when a juror 's testimony, taken as a whole, did not demonstrate bias as a matter of law and appellant failed to object to the juror's alleged bias at trial. The court held that, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a), the trial court properly denied appellant's request to instruct the jury on parole eligibility in the event that appellant received a life sentence because &sect; 4(a) specifically excluded the possibility of that instruction in a capital case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction of capital murder because the trial court did not commit reversible error when it excluded a veniremember because of her personal feelings and a juror was shown that she could serve fairly and impartially. The court also held that the trial court properly excluded jury instructions on parole eligibility because statutory law specifically excluded that instruction in capital cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Court of Appeals, Fourth Supreme Judicial District (Texas), which affirmed his conviction on one count of capital murder. Defendant contended that the trial judge was absolutely disqualified from presiding over the trial because he had served as counsel for the State in the case and that the trial court erred in failing to inform the jury that the State's witness was an accomplice witness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder for the shooting death of a victim he was hired to kill. On appeal of his conviction, defendant contended that the trial judge should have been absolutely disqualified from presiding over defendant's trial because he had served as counsel for the State in the case. At an evidentiary hearing ordered by the court of appeals, the judge testified that he did not present the case to the grand jury, did not participate in any examining trial, did not conduct a field investigation, did not interview witnesses and did not prepare legal research in the case, did not ever examine the State's file, and made no court appearance in the cause or any other cause related to defendant. The judge further testified that in all probability the only involvement he had ever had in defendant's case would have been preparing documents during an arraignment while he was a prosecutor. Accordingly, on appeal, the court found that there was no reason to disqualify the judge and overruled defendant's ground of review. The court also found no merit in defendant's other allegations of error. The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals, which affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, finding that the judge was not disqualified because he had not actually participated in the prosecution, that the State's witness was not an accomplice witness as a matter of law, and that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in a Victoria County trial court (Texas) for capital murder of a police officer. Defendant challenged the change of venue, the voluntariness of his confession, and the admissibility of a confession of a co-defendant used by the prosecution in defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder for killing a police officer who was acting in the lawful discharge of his official duty. After a jury trial, the trial court imposed the death penalty. Defendant challenged the change of venue sought by the state and granted by the prior district court on its own motion; he also alleged that the trial court erred in admitting his confession and that of his brother, a codefendant and defense witness. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Due to the extensive publicity, a change of venue was appropriate to give both sides a fair trial. The prior district court, on its own motion, was allowed to hold a hearing regarding change of venue on notice given to defendant regarding the state's motion. The trial court did not err in admitting defendant's confession. There was no evidence to show that he was under the influence of medication to the extent that he could not think clearly at the time the statement was given. The confession of defendant's brother, previously convicted of this crime in a separate trial, was properly used to impeach the brother as a defense witness after he testified inconsistently with the prior statement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction. A change of venue was proper given the publicity, and defendant had sufficient notice regarding the hearing on the motion to change venue. The confession of defendant was voluntarily given because testimony did not prove he was unable to think clearly at the time it was given. The co-defendant's confession was properly used only for impeachment purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for capital murder that was entered by the Jefferson County Court (Texas), which assessed his punishment at death pursuant to Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant participated in a jewelry store robbery, during which two people were shot and killed. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's capital murder conviction. The court concluded that a rational trier of fact could have found the evidence sufficient to establish that appellant, acting either alone or as a party, committed capital murder. The court noted that appellant incorrectly interpreted a recent holding of the United State Supreme Court as applying to the guilt stage of the trial. The court found that the holding only concerned the imposition of the death penalty on one who, though not the actual killer, was a major participant in the felony committed. The court held that appellee state's challenge for cause of a potential juror was properly sustained by the trial judge because the venireperson's views on the death penalty would have prevented or substantially impaired his performance as a juror. The trial court's overruling of appellant's challenge for cause of another venireperson was proper because although the venireperson was confused regarding the applicability of the law of parties, found in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 7.01, 7.02, he was not biased or prejudiced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for capital murder and held that the evidence of appellant's participation in the robbery of a jewelry store, during which two people were shot and killed, was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find that appellant, acting either alone or as a party, committed capital murder and that the death sentence was appropriate based on appellant's reckless indifference to life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that none of the 20 points of error presented contained reversible error and affirmed appellant's conviction for capital murder. Because appellant had been previously tried and convicted for the offense, the omission of the victim's name from the indictment did not impact his ability to prepare a defense. The court admonished the prosecutor for claiming that he represented the victim's family, but held that the claim did not deprive appellant of a fair trial. Noting that he did not exercise all of his peremptory strikes and viewing the totality of a particular juror's voir dire, the court held that appellant's challenge for cause was properly overruled. Another venireperson was improperly excused by the trial judge sua sponte; however, appellant waived the error by not objecting at that time. The prosecution's comment on remarks appellant made to his doctor were proper because they were not protected by privilege. A witness's remark alluding to appellant's first trial was cured by an immediate jury instruction. There was no evidence that the jury was made aware via the testimony of the assistant warden of the previous conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment convicting appellant of capital murder. The court overruled all of the 20 points of error presented finding that none of them contained reversible error. The court noted that the prosecutor's remarks that he represented the victim's family was an error and strongly stated that such remarks were inappropriate. However, the court held that the remarks did not deprive appellant of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated kidnapping and sentenced under an enhancement statute for a prior felony conviction. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 20.04(b) provided a reduction of the charge to a second degree felony if defendant voluntarily released the victim alive and in a safe place. Because the statute provided mitigated punishment and did not create an element of the crime, the court determined that it was proper for the trial court to refuse to submit the issue during the guilt phase, but to submit it at the punishment phase. The court found that the prior conviction used for sentence enhancement was not void because defendant had entered a knowing and voluntary guilty plea in the prior case. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and found that the trial court did not err in admitting the penitentiary packet into evidence because discrepancies between a copy of the prior judgment in the court's file and that in the penitentiary packet were due to obvious clerical mistakes and did not rebut the inherent reliability of the official record that was admitted as hearsay evidence for purposes of sentence enhancement.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.07. The appellate court held that the penal code provisions for prosecution of corporations and other artificial legal entities did not extend to any type of criminal homicide.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant corporation was convicted of criminally negligent homicide under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.07, because it caused the death of two individuals in a motor vehicle collision, acting through two of its agents. The appellate court reversed the conviction because it believed that the legislature could not have intended to include corporations within the class of culpable parties for negligent homicide, due to their inability to form intent. The state sought petition for discretionary review. The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and remanded. The court rejected the argument that a corporation could not be held criminally liable for homicide in absence of a specific statutory provision and concluded that the intention of the legislature could hardly be made clearer given the history, the reform intended and the literal meaning of the statutes involved. The court held that the legislature plainly intended to include corporations within the criminal field of negligent homicide by use of the term &quot;person&quot;, defined in both Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1.07(27), and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17A.01(b), to expressly embrace corporations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder in the death of a police officer. Defendant had been examined by mental health experts prior to trial, and argued the insanity defense. On appeal, defendant claimed that state's introduction of mental health expert testimony during the penalty phase of the trial to prove his future dangerousness violated his U.S. Const. amend. V privilege against self-incrimination. The court affirmed the conviction, and found no error in the introduction of the testimony. By introducing the mental health expert testimony in the course of the insanity defense during the guilt phase of the trial, defendant waived the right to object to introduction of mental health expert testimony in the guilt phase of the trial. Even if it had been error, because of the weight of state's evidence against defendant, it would have been harmless error.</SPAN></P>

Relator filed a writ of mandamus to compel respondent to grant relator's motions for legislative continuances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's parole was administratively revoked without hearing by the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles (board) pursuant to Tex.

The court held that due course of law, like due process, required at the least an informal hearing structured to assure that the finding of a parole violation was based on verified facts and that the board's discretion was informed by an accurate knowledge of appellant's behavior. In the event the board again considered revoking appellant's parole, the court held that appellant was entitled to a final revocation hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted appellant's postconviction application for writ of habeas corpus after his parole was administratively revoked without a hearing. The court held that the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed a hearing to assure that a finding of a parole violation was based on verified facts and that the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole's discretion was informed by an accurate knowledge of appellant's behavior.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator defense attorneys filed a mandamus application from Harris County (Texas). Relators sought to compel respondents, county auditor and commissioners court, to act pursuant to their statutory authority and pay relators' attorney fees in accordance with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.05.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A board of judges adopted a fee schedule for court-appointed attorneys in criminal cases. On respondent county auditor's recommendation, respondent commissioners court adopted the schedule. Relator defense attorneys all had trial court orders for payment that were submitted to respondent county auditor and were reduced because the claims exceeded the maximum amount in the fee schedule. Relators sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondents to pay attorney fees in accordance with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.05. The court had mandamus jurisdiction because relators sought relief pursuant to a criminal law statute. Relators were entitled to mandamus because they sought to compel a ministerial act. Respondents could not abdicate their ministerial duty to either pay reasonable attorney fees awarded by a trial court, or establish through a lawsuit that the fees were unreasonable. There was no authorization for respondents' reduction of the claims and the fee schedule contradicted the legislative intent behind art. 26.05. The remedy of filing suit in civil district court was inadequate and could not provide relators the same swift or effective relief as mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted relator defense attorneys' mandamus application because relators had no other adequate remedy at law and respondents, county auditor and commissioners court, had a mandatory ministerial duty to pay relators reasonable attorney fees. There was no authorization for respondents to utilize a fee schedule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant picked up two hitchhiking teenagers in his truck, drove them down a gravel road, and attacked them both, killing one and leaving the other for dead.

The court affirmed and held that under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 46.02, the trial court could order a competency examination at any time defendant's competency was at issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator trial court judge brought a mandamus proceeding contesting the issuance of a writ of mandamus by respondent Court of Appeals for the Second Supreme Judicial District (Texas), which directed relator to allow defendant to have a copy of a minor complainant's videotaped statement. Relator contended that denying discovery of evidence was a discretionary act reviewable only on appeal, and thus not the proper subject of a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child, filed discovery motions seeking access to video taped interviews of three complainant children. Defendant's attorneys and his expert witness viewed the tape, but relator trial court judge refused to allow the expert witness to have a copy. Defendant sought a writ of mandamus from respondent court of appeals compelling relator to allow the discovery. Respondent granted the writ. On appeal, relator sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondent to withdraw its order of mandamus. The court conditionally issued the writ. The court held that mandamus jurisdiction had been extended to courts of appeals in criminal law matters under Tex. Gov't Code &sect; 22.221(b) (1987). The court adopted the clear abuse of discretion standard in reviewing exceptional mandamus cases in criminal law matters. The court held that respondent clearly abused its discretion in granting a writ where defendant could appeal relator's discovery order, there was no evidence the that tape was exculpatory or mitigating, and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.071, did not require discovery rendering relator's order discretionary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court conditionally granted relator trial court judge's application for writ of mandamus and upon failure of respondent court of appeals to withdraw its order of mandamus would direct it to do so. The court held that denying discovery of evidence was a discretionary act of relator; therefore, respondent abused its discretion in directing relator to allow defendant to have a copy of a minor complainant's videotaped statement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the 282nd Judicial District of Dallas County (Texas), in which he was convicted of capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(1) and sentenced to death by lethal injection upon the jury's affirmative finding of the special issues in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that appellant's assertion that the trial judge impermissibly ignored the provisions of the Code Construction Act during his remarks to the prospective jurors about the special issues in a capital murder trial was waived due to appellant's failure to object to the instruction and thereby preserve the issue for appeal. The court then found that it was not error to excuse prospective jurors, on appellee state's motion for cause, where the record made clear that each juror's view substantially would have impaired the juror's performance of his or her duty in accordance with the instructions and the oath. The court further noted that the reference to automatic decision making and the requirement to prove a juror's bias with unmistakable clarity had been abandoned. The court overruled appellant's remaining points of error regarding admission of evidence, refusal to give jury instructions, and improper closing argument, and affirmed, concluding that there was no error in appellee's retroactive use of a peremptory challenge where appellant failed to object to appellee's substitution of an unused peremptory challenge for a previous challenge for cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed appellant's capital murder conviction and death sentence, overruling all of appellant's assignments of error and concluding that the excusal of veniremen on appellee state's motion for cause was permissible where the record indicated that each excused juror's views substantially would have impaired the performance of his or her duty, as required under the instructions and oath.</SPAN></P>

The district court judge approved the magistrate's conviction and sentence of probation, but then granted the prosecution's motion and revoked appellant's probation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the decision of the trial court.

The court granted appellant's petition for discretionary review in order to review the lower court's determination on the constitutionality of the house bill and Tex. Parks &amp; Wild.

The court rejected all of appellant's 28 points of error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated, informed of his Miranda rights, asked to provide a breath sample, and warned of the consequences of a refusal, including use of the refusal against him at his trial, pursuant to Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeals, Tenth Supreme Judicial District of Texas, which affirmed appellant's conviction by a jury of driving while intoxicated. Appellant contested rulings that an erroneous jury charge on reasonable doubt was harmless, and that appellant's refusal to take a breath test was admissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested for driving while intoxicated after an officer stopped him for driving erratically. The officer detected alcohol on appellant's breath, but appellant refused to take a breathalyzer test. His subsequent conviction in a jury trial was affirmed by the lower appellate court. Appellant first contended that the jury charge defining reasonable doubt was erroneous. The court agreed, explicitly refusing to condone jury instructions that amplify on the meaning of reasonable doubt, and noting that in this state, only a non-definitional charge on reasonable doubt was normally given. However, the court found the error harmless to appellant because it heightened the state's burden of proof. Appellant also argued that the admission of evidence that he refused to undergo a breathalyzer test violated his U.S. Const. amend. V right against self-incrimination because he was not given Miranda warnings. The court held that defendant's refusal to submit to the officer's request to take a breathalyzer test was not a product of interrogation, and therefore a Miranda warning was not required. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's driving while intoxicated conviction. While disapproving the definition of reasonable doubt given in jury charge, the court held that the instruction favored appellant by imposing a greater burden of proof on the state. The court also held that testimony concerning appellant's refusal to take a breathalyzer test was admissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed for discretionary review of a judgment from the Court of Appeals, 14th Supreme Judicial District of Texas, which ruled that a defense under a repealed statute was available for appellant, a child molester.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of two counts of sexual abuse of a child, and assessed his punishment on each count at 10 years confinement. On appeal, the lower appellate court reversed the conviction, holding that appellant was improperly denied the defense of &quot;promiscuity&quot; as defined in the now-repealed Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.10(b) (1983). Although that statute specifically limited its application to offenses where the victim was of the opposite sex from the alleged offender, and both the complainant and appellant were males, the lower appellate court held that the limiting provision was an unconstitutional violation of equal protection. Thus, the limiting provision was struck, and the lower appellate court held that appellant was improperly denied the defense. Upon the state's petition for discretionary review, the decision was reversed. The court found that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.10(b) (1983) did not constitute a violation of appellant's right to equal protection. The cause was remanded for further consideration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged by way of a discretionary review an order from the Court of Appeals, Fourteenth Supreme Judicial District (Texas), which affirmed appellant's conviction for delivery of a controlled substance in violation of Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of delivery of a controlled substance in violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.03. Appellant's conviction was affirmed on appeal. Appellant challenged the order asserting that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict because the substance was not a controlled substance. The court affirmed appellant's conviction. According to the court, the elements of an offense under &sect; 4.03 were knowingly or intentionally delivering a controlled substance. The court held that under &sect; 4.03, when delivery was by actual or constructive transfer, the substance must be proved to be a controlled substance. However, the court stated that when delivery was by offer to sell, no transfer needed to take place. The court held that the offense was complete when, by words or deed, a person knowingly or intentionally offered to sell what he stated was a controlled substance. Therefore, the fact that the substance was later found not to be a controlled substance did not render the evidence insufficient to prove the offense. The court concluded that the offense was complete when appellant stated that he had a $ 100 bag of heroin to sell.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for delivery of a controlled substance because appellant committed the crime when he offered to sell and deliver what he stated was contraband.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the district court (Texas), of capital murder, and punishment was assessed at death. Defendant did not contest the sufficiency of the evidence for conviction or the jury findings concerning the special issues under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071. Defendant asserted errors concerning voir dire, portions of the prosecutor's argument, and admission of an alleged extraneous offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the appeal of his capital murder conviction, defendant asserted grounds of error involving voir dire, argument error, and improper admission of evidence of an alleged extraneous rape and murder. The court confirmed the conviction. The court concluded that one of the voir dire errors had been waived because no objection had been made to the venire member's excusal at trial. The other four alleged errors centered on the venire members' refusal to take the oath to render a true verdict according to the evidence and law. Defendant argued that the prosecutor's hypothetical dilemmas mislead them into thinking they could not use their emotions. The court concluded that the veniremembers were properly struck when they stated that their emotions would control their answers, despite evidence beyond a reasonable doubt contrary to their feelings. Any alleged error in the prosecutor's argument was found to be harmless, due to the substantial evidence against defendant. Finally, evidence of the rape and murder of defendant's first victim was properly admitted because consideration of the entire context of defendant's behavior was vital in the capital murder of the rape victim's companion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed. The court found evidence of rape and murder of a victim by defendant was properly admitted as an act contemporaneous with the capital murder of the second victim thereafter; alleged error in the prosecutor's jury argument was harmless. Veniremembers were properly struck for stating that their emotions would control their answers, despite evidence beyond a reasonable doubt contrary to their feelings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's death sentence for capital murder was commuted to life imprisonment by the governor before the court of appeals had a chance to consider a remand from the United States Supreme Court, which had vacated the trial court's judgment. Defendant brought an application for a post-conviction writ of habeas corpus in the trial court, contending that the commutation by the governor was a constitutional usurpation of judicial power, and that the Supreme Court's disposition of his case left no valid death sentence for the governor to commute. The trial court denied the writ, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the record supported the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law. The commutation was not invalid even though it was imposed without defendant's consent. The indictment was not defective, and the trial court's finding that no evidence supported defendant's claim that a witness committed perjury was supported by the record. The existence of newly discovered evidence relevant to the guilt of defendant was not a ground for relief in a post conviction writ.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in an evidentiary hearing ordered by the court that, at the time of the guilty plea, the offense charged was a first-degree felony under the Controlled Substances Act and applicant was admonished as to the range of punishment for a first-degree felony. The statute was declared unconstitutional. Had the applicant been properly admonished as to the range of punishment for a third-degree felony, he would not have entered into a plea bargain for the maximum number of years as punishment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state petitioned for discretionary review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals, Fifth Supreme Judicial District, Dallas County (Texas), which reversed the trial court's conviction of appellant based on its finding that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction for violating Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 5472e, a statute enacted to regulate a specific type of conduct by contractors and subcontractors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was the construction contractor on a residential room addition job that was paid in installments as the work progressed and was not completed. Certain of appellant's employees were not fully paid for the work that they performed, and, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

Appellant was convicted of violation of the statute based on an indictment that alleged diversion of the trust funds. The court agreed with the appellate court's reversal of the trial court's conviction, finding that the evidence was insufficient to establish that appellant did not use the allegedly misapplied trust funds for reasonable overhead expenses, a permissible use of the trust funds under the statute. The court found that the indictment was null and void for failure to allege all elements of the offense because the prosecution failed to plead and prove the exception in the statute, that is, that appellant did not use the trust funds he was accused of misapplying to pay reasonable overhead expenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed for a writ of habeas corpus following exhaustion of his appeals from a judgment of the District Court for Taylor County (Texas), which entered his jury conviction on a charge of capital murder and sentenced him to death. Petitioner challenged the trial court's excusing for cause a prospective juror based upon his attitude toward the death penalty. Petitioner did not raise this issue on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After exhausting the direct appeals from his conviction for capital murder and death sentence, petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, raising an issue that had not been raised on appeal. The court postponed petitioner's execution in order to hear his petition. Petitioner claimed that the trial court erred in imposing the death penalty because a prospective juror was incorrectly excused under the Witherspoon rule, which provided that a death sentence could not be carried out if it was recommended by a jury from which a venireman was excluded for cause simply because he voiced general objections to the death penalty. The court reviewed the trial transcript, following which it found it clear that the excused juror's views were such as to prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath, as he specifically stated that the mandatory penalty of life or death would affect his deliberation on any issue of fact and he couldn't take the oath that it wouldn't. Thus, the court denied petitioner the requested relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner's writ of habeas corpus, finding no error in exclusion of the challenged juror from service. The court concluded that it was clear from the record that the prospective juror's views were such as to prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties, as he declared that the mandatory penalty of life or death would affect his deliberation on the issues and he could not take an oath stating otherwise.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and held that appellant's confessions and statements to a psychiatrist were voluntary and admissible, and did not require Miranda warnings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder. Defendant appealed his conviction based on insufficiency of evidence to support the conviction and the death penalty, the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury on accomplice witness testimony, improper voir dire questions, and improper closing argument by the prosecutor. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the witness who was present with defendant and co-defendants at the time of the murder was not an accomplice because there was no evidence to show that the witness took any affirmative act in furtherance of the crime, and, therefore, no jury instruction on accomplice testimony was required. The court held that the evidence to support the conviction was sufficient because a non-accomplice witness' testimony needs no corroboration. The court held that there was no evidence to support an instruction on aiding and abetting. The court held the prosecutor's argument was supported by the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner courtroom spectators applied for writs of habeas corpus to review their summary convictions for criminal contempt of court for being disrespectful and failing to rise upon the entrance of respondent county judge, after being duly admonished and warned by the bailiff to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a break in court proceedings, the bailiff noticed that petitioner courtroom spectators had failed to stand when respondent county judge exited the courtroom. The bailiff then advised petitioners to stand and, the next day, he warned them that they risked being held in contempt if they continued to refuse to rise. Petitioners insisted they had a religious right to refuse. When court reconvened and petitioners failed to rise, respondent summarily found them in contempt of court and sentenced them each to 30 days in jail. Petitioners then applied to the appellate court for writs of habeas corpus. In denying relief, the court ruled that petitioners' due process rights were not violated by the use of a summary procedure because their actions constituted direct contempt, which was subject to summary adjudication. Moreover, their conduct did constitute criminal contempt because it tended to obstruct the proper administration of justice and displayed a disregard of the seriousness of the court's function. Petitioners' religious rights were not infringed because they had the option of leaving the courtroom instead of refusing to rise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applications were denied because the actions by petitioners were a direct contempt and respondent's use of a summary procedure to convict and punish did not deprive them of due process; failure to rise upon entry of a judge was constituted as criminal contempt in that it disregarded the formality of a court's function and interrupted the proper administration of justice; and the rising requirement did not burden petitioners' religious freedom.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant murderer stabbed his victim 42 times. The court affirmed the judgment and the death penalty. The court held that appellant's confession was properly admitted.

The affidavit contained information from named citizen informers, including appellant's aunt and a police officer investigating the incident, that indicated that they had knowledge of the matters asserted and was sufficient to justify issuing the arrest warrant. The trial court did not err by granting appellee state's challenge for cause to a prospective juror who made it clear that she would require a standard of proof more stringent than beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court's denial of a videotape of the prosecutor's use of a mannequin did not deprive appellant of due process or hamper his ability to preserve issues for appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of driving while intoxicated, a violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 67011-1(a)(2)(B) (1984). A court of appeals reversed the verdict, holding that appellant was denied a limited right to counsel prior to deciding whether to provide a breath sample for an intoxilyzer test for alcohol concentration, but rejected appellant's facial attack upon art. 67011-1(a)(2)(B) as unconstitutionally creating an irrebuttable presumption of intoxication. The court granted both the state's and appellant's separate petitions for discretionary review. The court reversed and affirmed the judgment in part. The court held that under federal law, appellant did not have a right to counsel when giving the breath sample because formal adversarial proceedings had not been initiated until a complaint was filed after appellant gave the breath sample. The court held that there was no presumption of intoxication mentioned in art. 67011-1(a)(2)(B) and there was no mandatory conclusive presumption codified, foreclosing the constitutional attack on the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of violating Tex. Parks &amp; Wild.

Appellant sought review of his conviction on the ground that &sect; 47.037 was unconstitutional on its face as a violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV and Tex. Const. art I, &sect; 9. The court of appeals reversed appellant's conviction and held that &sect; 47.037 was unconstitutional. The state petitioned for discretionary review. The court agreed with the court of appeals and affirmed the decision. The court, adopting the opinion of the court of appeals, held that &sect; 47.037 was an unconstitutional violation of the right against unlawful search and seizure because it did not distinguish between residences and businesses in authorizing searches, but provided for an inspection at any time or any place.</SPAN></P>

Appellant also challenged his conviction on grounds that the evidence was insufficient to prove that appellant was the only one in the store and was the perpetrator of the crime. The victim and the store manager identified appellant as the perpetrator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court affirmed appellant's conviction of aggravated rape. The court granted appellant's petition for discretionary review to consider if evidence, elicited during an in-camera hearing, of the prosecutrix's prior sexual activity was properly excluded under the impeachment provision of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.13. The court affirmed, holding that appellant failed to establish his right to attack the prosecutrix's credibility. Whether the prosecutrix was or was not a virgin was not material to an issue in the case, and even if the evidence was relevant and material, its prejudicial nature outweighed its probative value. Noting how other jurisdictions had interpreted similar rape-shield statutes, the court held that &sect; 21.13 was constitutional on its face and as applied to appellant. The court found that appellant's rights under U.S. Const. amends. V, VI, XIV and Tex. Const. art I, &sect; 10, were not violated because there was no constitutional right to ask a witness questions that were irrelevant, the impact of the statute was primarily procedural, the right to confront and to cross-examine was not absolute, and appellant was accorded due process.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, the statute did not violate appellant's state and federal constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of the felony offense of gambling promotion. The court of appeals affirmed his conviction, holding that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 47.03(a)(2) was not unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous. The court granted appellant's petition for discretionary review and reversed the judgment of the court of appeals, finding that &sect; 47.03(a)(2) was unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous. Appellant alleged that the statutory language of receiving a bet was vague and that the allegation against him was subject to varied interpretation, thereby failing to give him requisite notice. The court determined that by using language synonymous with the old bookmaking statute, without limiting or explaining its application to &sect; 47.03(a)(2), the legislature had painted with too broad a brush. The court held that &sect; 47.03(a)(2), insofar as it prohibited receiving a bet, was unconstitutionally vague and unenforceable as a penal sanction.</SPAN></P>

In accordance with an amendment to the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

Prior to appeal, the court held that the amendment to the statute was unconstitutional and determined that the statute stood as if the amendment was never enacted. The court of appeals affirmed appellant's sentence because the pre-amendment statutory range was 2 to 10 years, and the jury's determination was within that range. The court held that the submission to the jury of a penalty range more severe than that authorized by law deprived appellant of a fair and impartial trial, even though the jury assessed punishment within the lawful range.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought reversal of an order of the 12th Supreme Judicial District Court of Appeals (Texas), upholding a trial judge's order which denied appellant bail pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who pled guilty to theft and received a sentence of probation, challenged an intermediate appellate panel's ruling upholding the trial judge's post-sentence order, which denied him bail pending appeal. The court reversed both lower courts' rulings and remanded the case to the trial judge with instructions to hold a hearing on appellant's bail application. Although appellant lacked a constitutional right to bail pending appeal, he had been granted a liberty interest in such bail, and as such the state was constitutionally obliged to provide appellant with notice of its intent to deny bail pending appeal and a hearing on his application for such bail. Since the trial judge failed to provide either notice or an opportunity for appellant to be heard, its decision denying appellant bail pending appeal without a hearing was unconstitutional. Accordingly, the case was remanded for a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed, and the case was remanded. Appellant was improperly denied bail pending the appeal of his criminal conviction, because due process required that he be given both notice and an opportunity to be heard at a post-sentencing bail hearing. Summary disposition of appellant's bail application was improper.</SPAN></P>

The trial court assessed punishment at 15 years confinement and a fine. The court granted applicant's petition for habeas corpus relief. The court found that prior to applicant's sentencing, the Court of Criminal Appeals had held unconstitutional House Bill 730, which was passed by the legislature in 1981 and purported to amend the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15. Under that holding the Controlled Substances Act stood as though H.B. 730 had never been enacted. Applicant was sentenced according to the provision of H.B. 730, however, which provided for a fine as well as a range of five to 99 years. The original Act had no provision for a fine. Under the original Act, in effect at the time of applicant's sentencing, the verdict on punishment was unauthorized by law and was therefore void at its inception.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant was convicted of capital murder and the trial court imposed the death penalty. On appeal, defendant asserted 19 grounds of error. After rejecting defendant's litany of grounds of error, it affirmed his conviction and sentence. The court found that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a change of venue. Next, the court rejected defendant's challenges to jury selection. The court also thought that defendant's confession was properly admitted because the police quit questioning him when he requested some time and defendant did not inform the police that he needed more time when questioning resumed. Also, defendant's confession was not involuntary because he was not informed that he was the target of a capital murder investigation. While defendant claimed that marital privilege required exclusion of the testimony of a witness for the prosecution, the court concluded that the witness could not have been married to defendant because she was still married to her prior husband. Defendant's conviction for capital murder was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Defendant's capital murder conviction and death sentence were upheld, because all of defendant's asserted errors were rejected, including issues of venue, jury selection, admissibility of his confession, prosecutor's closing argument, marital privilege, and the court reporter's failure to record bench conferences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a post-conviction application for a writ of habeas corpus from the 262nd District Court of Harris County (Texas), which convicted defendant of two counts of aggravated robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to prison and fined a total of $ 15,000 for two aggravated robberies. One conviction was enhanced for a prior robbery but one was not. Defendant filed an application for habeas corpus relief, contending that the convictions were void because he was fined in addition to the terms of imprisonment, which was unauthorized by law. The criminal court of appeals granted the application in part. Law did not authorize the $ 10,000 fine in the case with the enhancement. A fine was not authorized in addition to the enhancement of punishment. Before the amendment of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.10(b), the only recourse when the jury rendered a verdict unauthorized by law was to remand the case for a new trial. Under the amendment, if the jury assessed a punishment that was both authorized by law and not authorized by law, the trial court had the authority to reform the verdict to show punishment authorized by law. If the trial court did not do this, the appellate court could. The court reformed the verdict to delete the $ 10,000 fine. The $ 5,000 fine was authorized because there was no enhancement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(3) and sentenced to death. On appeal, that court held that evidence that defendant approached the victim's parked vehicle and asked for assistance, left and returned armed and with three other assailants, participated in the initial attack and then directed the attack on the victim, controlled the companion before beating, raping, and robbing her, and left with the victim's vehicle was sufficient to prove that defendant was a dominant actor in the offense. The court held that although one of the other assailants actually stabbed the victim, the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant and the others acted with the common purpose to commit the crimes and that the jury could have found that defendant had specific intent to kill the victim under the law of parties. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant acted deliberately with the expectation that death would result. The court held that defendant was not entitled to an instruction on lesser-included offenses. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for capital murder because the testimony of the victim's companion was sufficient to prove him guilty as a principal and a party to the murder and to prove that defendant had the specific intent to kill the victim. The trial court did not err in refusing to charge the jury on lesser-included offenses because there was nothing in the record to show that he was guilty only of murder and aggravated assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(3), and sentenced to death for intentionally causing victim's death by stabbing her with a knife. On appeal, the court held that testimony from the medical examiner concerning the crime scene and his autopsy of victim, evidence of appellant's criminal record, and appellant's reputation for violence was sufficient to support the jury's affirmative finding of the special issue regarding appellant's likelihood of being a continuing threat to society. The court held that it was unnecessary to consider a claim of non-production of an identification expert because testimony in the trial established identity at the crime scene without reference to the missing expert. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it requested the jury to keep deliberating and found that the length of deliberation was not unusually extended. Finally, the court held that it was not necessary to allege the constituent elements of the offense constituting the aggravating feature of a capital murder charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for capital murder, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1903(a)(3), asserting several points of error. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence. Defendant's right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI was not violated because the trial court's finding that defendant never asked for a lawyer before making his confession was supported by testimony from police officers. The admission of defendant's audio statement did not violate Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22, &sect; 3(a)(1), which did not require that all oral statements be visually recorded. The admission of a co-defendant's testimony that he and defendant took three lives was harmless error because the trial court directed the jury to disregard the statement and there was overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. The court held that the introduction, during the punishment phase of trial, of the details of defendant's prior offenses, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071, did not deny defendant due process of law or equal protection because the evidence was relevant to the issue of defendant's future dangerousness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant of capital murder, holding that his confession was admissible because the trial court's finding of voluntariness was supported by the evidence, that there was no statutory requirement that defendant's statement be visually recorded, and that evidence of the underlying facts of defendant's prior convictions was admissible at the punishment stage of the capital case.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was convicted of the manufacture of at least 400 grams of methamphetamine and sentenced under the amendments to the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, relator for the state, sought a writ of mandamus when respondent county judge heard and granted a recusal motion after another county judge who refused to recuse himself had already tried the case for which recusal was sought. The court held that the state was entitled to the writ. Respondent lacked a legal basis for assuming jurisdiction because neither Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1970-75a, &sect;&sect; 2 and 3, covering selection of a presiding judge and the power to adopt local rules, nor Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1970-301e.2, &sect; 8, covering docketing, gave jurisdiction. There was no showing that local rules had been adopted which authorized respondent's actions. The court further held that under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 4.16, the court where the complaint was filed retained jurisdiction where two or more courts shared criminal jurisdiction, that the recusal order was moot because the trial had been completed, and that under Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a, a judge declining recusal should have referred the motion to the presiding judge. The writ was a proper remedy because no other adequate legal remedy was available and the relief sought was ministerial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of the criminal nonsupport under Texas Penal Code &sect; 25.05. The appellate court reversed the conviction, held that the statute was unconstitutional in its entirety, and remanded the case back to the trial court for trial under the former penal code provisions. The court granted the state's petition for discretionary review to determine whether the court of appeals erred by holding that &sect; 25.05. was unconstitutional in its entirety. The state conceded that the statute was unconstitutional, but argued that the appellate court erred in remanding the case for trial under the prior law. The court reversed in part and affirmed in part, holding the statute was unconstitutional because it deprived appellant of his right of due process by shifting the burden of disproving an element of the offense to appellant. However, the court found that the appellate court erred in declaring the entire statute unconstitutional because it failed to consider the severability clause, 1973 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 399, &sect; 7.

While on parole, he was convicted of burglary of a habitation and sentenced to 25 years in prison. As a result of his burglary conviction, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles (board) and the governor revoked his parole on the rape sentence without a hearing of any kind. Defendant filed a habeas corpus petition in the convicting court, under Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 11.07, which found him legally restrained. The matter was remanded to the convicting court to hold an evidentiary hearing, after which it recommended that defendant's parole revocation be held void. Upon review, the court found defendant was entitled to the relief he sought because Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 22 provided that any person accused of violating his parole was entitled to a hearing before the board. The court found that the board exceeded its authority in enacting &sect; 145.41(b)(5) of the Rules of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, which provided for the revocation of parole without a hearing if a person on parole for a felony conviction was convicted of another felony.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed that the statutory scheme violated the fundamental right of privacy. The court held that dildos were more similar to obscene material than to contraceptives because contraceptives were used to implement the constitutionally protected decision not to beget a child, whereas obscene material was used merely for sexual stimulation and gratification. The court held that the state had the right to restrain traffic in non-communicative objects designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs. The court held that the statute did not deprive appellant of a substantive economic right in violation of Tex. Const. art.

The hispanic appellant was not entitled to a greater latitude in the degree of insult sufficient to enrage him because the reasonable man standard was employed precisely to avoid different applications of the manslaughter law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for sexual abuse of a child in two cases and indecency with a child in one. The court of appeals affirmed. The court reversed one of the cases and affirmed two. The court overruled the court of appeals' holding that multiple sexual acts within a 24-hour period did not constitute &quot;promiscuity&quot; under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 21.09 and 21.10 without proof of continuing conduct. The court found that the rape shield law was inapplicable but, because the victims were not of the opposite sex, defendant could not use the &quot;promiscuity&quot; defense. The court reversed one conviction after finding that defendant's objections to the admission of photographs preserved the issue for appeal and that the trial court erred in admitting the photographs, which were evidence of extraneous offenses, to rebut an alibi defense. The court held that the alibi testimony did not raise the issue of identity because the victims all knew defendant and that the photographs had no probative value and were highly prejudicial. The court affirmed the other two convictions because the court found the &quot;promiscuity&quot; defense, the only issue on appeal, to be inapplicable in those cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of a decision from the Court of Appeals, Fourteenth Supreme Judicial District of Texas, Harris County, which convicted them of possession of at least 400 grams of cocaine with intent to deliver and assessed punishment at 25 years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of possession of at least 400 grams of cocaine with intent to deliver and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. The trial court charged the jury on the range of punishment set by House Bill 730, which purported to amend the Controlled Substances Act. The amendment range of punishment was more severe than the pre-amendment range in that the minimum term of confinement was greater by ten years, the effect of the 15-year minimum term precluded the jury from recommending probation, and the jury was told it could assess a fine up to $ 250,000. The purported amendment was held to be unconstitutional and invalid. The appellate court affirmed their conviction and punishment. The court reversed, finding that the trial court not only instructed the jury that the law authorized a large fine, but also withheld from the jury the authority to assess a minimum term of five years and to consider recommending probation if defendants were eligible. The court found that the submission to the jury of a penalty range more severe than that authorized by law deprived defendants of a fair and impartial trial, even though the jury assessed punishment within the lawful range.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession with intent to deliver cocaine. He appealed, contending that it was error to deny his motion to dismiss because the statute upon which the prosecution was based was unconstitutional.

The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction, and defendant filed a petition for discretionary review. On review, the court held that defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily pled guilty as the trial court properly admonished defendant on the range of the punishment for a first degree felony offense and defendant did not carry his burden of proving that he was harmed by the trial court's admonishment. But the court reversed and remanded the cause as to defendant's search and seizure claim, holding that defendant's judicial confession did not waive his right to appeal his pretrial suppression motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision by the Texas Appeals Court, Williamson County [3rd Dist.] (Texas), which affirmed the trial court's conviction of appellant, after a guilty plea, of possessing more than 5 pounds and less than 50 pounds of marihuana in violation of the Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Controlled Substances Code Ann. &sect; 4.051(b)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted, after a guilty plea, of the offense of possession of marihuana in violation of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), Tex. Controlled Substances Code Ann. &sect; 4.051(b)(4), and his conviction was affirmed by a lower appeals court. Appellant sought further review of his conviction, contending that his plea was involuntary. Appellant argued that after his conviction, the court of appeals held that House Bill 730, 1981 Tex. Gen. Laws 268, which added &sect; 4.051 to the CSA, was unconstitutional, and that the CSA stood as if House Bill 730 had never been enacted. The result of this decision reduced appellant's offense from a second to a third degree felony, and reduced the minimum sentence. Accordingly, appellant argued that as the trial court's sentence admonishment was based on the longer minimum sentence contained in the unconstitutional statute, appellant's plea was thus involuntary. The court rejected appellant's contention and affirmed his conviction, holding that as appellant and the prosecution agreed during the plea discussions to a sentence that would be the minimum whether the offense was a second or third-degree penalty, appellant's plea was voluntary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower courts' judgments convicting appellant of possession of marihuana, holding that appellant's guilty plea was involuntary, even though it was based on his plea to a statute later held to be unconstitutional, as the sentence agreed upon by the prosecution and appellant was the lowest sentence available under either the unconstitutional or constitutional version of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court also affirmed and found that a five-prong test determined whether a jury's discussion on the parole law during deliberations was reversible error. It must have been shown that there was a misstatement of the law, asserted as a fact, by one professing to know the law, which is relied upon by other jurors, who for that reason changed their vote to a harsher punishment.

Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 11.07. Defendant complained that he was denied the right to appeal the judgment of conviction for burglary. The court held that, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 3d(b), defendant was barred from appealing the decision to proceed to adjudication. The court also reviewed defendant's contention that the use of a magistrate to accept his plea to the motion seeking adjudication and his judicial confession to the violation of probation violated the conditions of Tex. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4(b). The court found that the magistrate had not gone beyond what would have been done in accepting a negotiated plea and therefore held that a hearing to proceed to adjudication was contemplated by the statute, and thus, no error occurred by permitting the magistrate to preside over the hearing to proceed to adjudication.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the perimeters of the statute were imprecise. The court found that the statute did not give a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know was it prohibited. The court found that the phrase &quot;a person showing evidence of intoxication&quot; described not only those who are so intoxicated that they exhibited outward signs of that condition, but also those who were not intoxicated, yet, nevertheless, exhibited one or more of the classic symptoms of intoxication that were universally accepted as &quot;evidence&quot; in criminal cases.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for capital murder claiming that the trial court, Trinity County (Texas), erred when it refused to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter, refused to suppress his confessions based on Miranda violations and improper arrest and search, and refused to suppress evidence of his injuries. He also contended that the evidence was insufficient to convict him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. Defendant was Mirandized before giving statements and the officers saw blood on his back; however, he was not arrested at that time. Defendant then confessed. Defendant contended that the court should have allowed a voluntary manslaughter instruction to the jury, that the confession was improperly obtained, that his arrest and search were unconstitutional, and that the evidence was insufficient to convict him. The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction, holding that there was no evidence to supported a voluntary manslaughter instruction to the jury because Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.04 required defendant to show that he was acting under sudden passion when he killed, and defendant's confessions proved the opposite. The court held that defendant's confession was admissible because a Miranda warning was given, although it wasn't a verbatim rendition of Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 15.17&sect; 2(A). Finally, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant and that defendant had waived his U.S. Const. amend. V right to silence when he raised insanity as a defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's capital murder conviction, holding that the evidence was overwhelming and that defendant was not entitled to the voluntary manslaughter instruction because he failed to prove he acted under sudden passion, anger, or rage at the time of the killing. The court stated that a verbatim recitation was not required where Miranda warnings were articulated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with having intentionally caused a death while in the course of committing and attempting to commit the offense of robbery. A trial court found appellant guilty of capital murder and the jury returned affirmative findings to the two special issues submitted under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b). Punishment was assessed at death. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found the evidence to be sufficient to show that appellant intentionally caused the death of the deceased. A rational trier of fact could have inferred from appellant's acts of entering the office carrying a deadly weapon, pursuing the victim as she attempted to escape, shooting her at close range, and then fleeing the scene of the shooting, that appellant intended to cause the death of the deceased. There was ample evidence to show appellant's &quot;future dangerousness.&quot; Evidence showed three prior felony convictions, a series of unsuccessful attempts by appellant to find a suitable robbery victim, appellant's repeated possession of firearms, and an unadjudicated burglary offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two jewelry store workers were killed during a robbery. After defendant confessed to participating in the robbery and several witnesses testified that they saw defendant near the store where the robbery and shooting took place, a jury convicted defendant of capital murder. Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction where his confession was not corroborated by any evidence from any source that he took part in the robbery or was in the store during the robbery. The court held that a confession may render sufficient circumstantial evidence that would be insufficient without it; therefore, where defendant confessed to robbing one of the jewelry store workers and a witness identified defendant as standing near the jewelry store at the time of the shooting, the facts and circumstances taken in connection with the confession amply established the offense and defendant's link to it. Furthermore, the court held that defendant received effective assistance of counsel where nothing in the record indicated that defense counsel failed to interview witnesses prior to trial, as alleged by defendant. Therefore, the court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' misdemeanor charges for failing to identify themselves to a peace officer were submitted to the trial court under a brief stipulation of evidence. The court of appeals held that because no evidence was introduced, the cases should be analyzed as &quot;agreed cases&quot; in which deductions or inferences could not be drawn from the stipulated facts. Because the stipulation did not state that defendants knew the person requesting their identities was a peace officer, the court of appeals reversed defendants' convictions. The court granted the prosecution's petition for discretionary review and reversed the court of appeals, finding that the requisite culpable mental state could be inferred from defendants' acts as set forth in the stipulation, which spoke of arrests for failure to obey a lawful order to get off the street and which stated that one of the defendants had already given her name and address to &quot;another officer.&quot; The court, however, rejected the prosecution's argument that it was not necessary to prove that defendants knew that the individual making the inquiry was a peace officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Discretionary review without petition therefor was granted to review an order of the Ninth Supreme Judicial District Court of Appeals, Harris County (Texas), which determined that a deputy municipal court clerk could issue a capias writ commanding defendant's arrest for a misdemeanor offense, possession of methamphetamine, without some intervention by a detached and neutral magistrate to determine the existence of probable cause to arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and searched after an investigatory stop and license check showed an outstanding capias warrant. While the capias stated that it was issued in connection with a motorcycle helmet charge, it in fact had been issued by a deputy municipal court clerk, based on his finding that defendant had failed to attend a municipal court hearing on a different traffic charge. As a result of the search, defendant was convicted of possessing methamphetamine. The lower court rejected defendant's challenge to the capias, and the court reviewed the matter, without petition, on its own motion. The court reversed, holding that the court clerk had taken both prosecutorial role and the role of a police officer or complaining witness; but that the capias had been issued without any judicial determination of probable cause. Because federal and state constitutions required a probable cause determination to be made by a detached and neutral magistrate, before a warrant issued, and the issuing court clerk was not a such a magistrate, the capias was invalid, and the evidence seized in connection therewith had to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed. Defendant's conviction for possession of methamphetamine could not stand, because the warrant on which defendant was arrested was invalid, in that it had not been issued on a finding of probable cause made by a detached and neutral magistrate, as constitutionally required. A capias writ issued solely by a deputy municipal court clerk was insufficient, and the evidence against defendant should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner district attorney requested a writ of mandamus and prohibition to require respondent district court judge to be stopped from implementing an amended procedure for sentencing guidelines which required the preparation and inspection of pre-sentence reports prior to a determination of guilt. The court granted the petitions, and ordered that respondent cease and desist from imposing the amended procedure. The court held that proposed Tex Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 4, upon which respondent based his guidelines, was a mandate to trial courts to direct a probation officer to make the prescribed report in every criminal case, excepting only two alternative conditions. The basic concept of the enacting bill was seriously flawed, in that there was no discretion to be exercised by judge or court in sentencing. A literal reading of the statute compelled the conclusion that a trial court was required to order a presentence investigative report in every criminal case regardless of whether the case was tried by jury or before court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant, who was eligible for probation, came before respondent judge to enter his plea of guilty to burglary of a building. Respondent trial court judge ordered applicant to respond to whether he understood the conditions of probation as &quot;yes sir,&quot; as indicia that applicant was trying to be responsible. After applicant failed to say &quot;sir&quot; following several admonishments, respondent imposed a 30 day sentence for the burglary. Applicant sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondent to rescind the sentence, contending that respondent lacked authority to impose the 30 day sentence. The court denied the writ of mandamus, finding that mandamus was limited to ministerial acts. Because sentencing under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect;&sect; 6b(a) and (b), was a discretionary act, mandamus was not a proper form of relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on the State's charge of capital murder and appealed. Defendant complained of the exclusion of 12 prospective jurors for cause, as some may have been improperly dismissed. The court found that defendant received all the relief which he requested because defendant received one additional peremptory strike that he requested and made no further objection concerning the trial court's action pertaining to the jurors. The court held that defendant waived any error. Defendant contended that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 violated the U.S. Const. amends. XVIII and XIV, because it contained no provisions for directing and instructing the jury's consideration of mitigating circumstances at the punishment phase of the trial. The court affirmed, because no jury charge regarding evidence of any mitigating circumstances was necessary, and defendant never requested the trial court to charge the jury on mitigation. The court found that conflicting evidence was presented as to whether defendant was the triggerman, thus, it was very possible that the jury convicted defendant believing that he did kill the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting defendant of capital murder was affirmed, because defendant waived any error of improperly excluded potential jurors, no jury charge regarding mitigating circumstances was necessary, and conflicting evidence could have lead the jury to convict defendant believing that he, and not his co-defendant, killed the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court, Dallas County (Texas), which convicted defendant for capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(3) and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder, and sentenced to death. He appealed. The court affirmed, rejecting a error in the lower court's sustaining the state's challenges for cause during voir dire, because the state could bar a person from jury service if his beliefs suggested that he would ignore the law or violate an oath. It was also proper to admit photos of the victim; an officer's testimony that a substance in one photo was blood; and a register drawer, all three rulings being in the trial court's discretion. The court rejected a challenge to the admission of details concerning a prior conviction, and an unadjudicated robbery offense, because neither matter unfairly surprised defendant. Objections to a pen packet were rejected, because defendant failed to show that the prior conviction was void for lack of waiver of indictment. There was sufficient evidence to support the second special issue given to the jury; and to show that defendant would commit violent acts and posed an ongoing threat. The court rejected a claim of error based on hypothetical questions being asked of an expert; and flatly rejected a constitutional challenge to the capital punishment statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Defendant's conviction for capital murder and his subsequent death sentence were upheld, because no errors were made by the lower court either during the guilt or the penalty phases as to the exclusion of certain jurors or the admission of certain evidence and testimony. Defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the state capital punishment statute was summarily rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was alleged that appellant was seen by witness running out of a store with a box in his hand after she heard shots fired. Appellant confessed that he took a box of money from the store, but did not think that he had shot the sales clerk. Upon his plea of guilty, a jury convicted appellant of capital murder and pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.01(e) assessed his punishment at death. Appellant challenged the conviction based on allegations of error connected with his plea of guilty before the jury and the court's admonishment regarding punishment. The court found that art. 26.14 in conjunction with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.14 dictated that appellant's plea of guilty to a jury was in fact a jury trial, that the trial court did not prevent evidence that concerned deliberate nature of the offense, there was no due process violation in the state's alleging aggravation as opposed to mitigation, and there was no error found in the assessment of punishment as defendant did not object to any charges nor requests that any be given.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of capital murder, and sentenced to death. On review, the court found that trial court properly denied appellant's motion for a mistrial because appellant's contention that he had been denied the right to make intelligent challenges for cause during the voir dire examination was without merit. Further, appellant's contention that he was denied due process was rejected because appellant's was not deprived of effectiveness of counsel. Additionally, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the state's challenge to a prospective juror for cause because the juror stated that her beliefs would cause her to resolve a fact issue differently than she would otherwise. Finally, the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding that appellant's deliberate conduct caused the death of the deceased. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed were affirmed because the trial court did not err in overruling appellant's motions for mistrial, continuance, or leave to interrogate certain selected jurors because such acts did not deprive him of due process or effective assistance of counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought a petition for discretionary review from the Court of Appeals, Fifth Supreme Judicial District of Texas, Dallas County (Texas), which held Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1918c (1983) entitled &quot;Magistrates in district courts in Dallas County,&quot; was unconstitutionally applied under the facts of appellant's case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court found Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1918c (1983), was constitutional pursuant to Tex. Const. art. 5, &sect; 1, but was unconstitutionally applied to appellant. On the state's appeal, the court found that the record did not support the lower court's finding that the magistrate considered and denied a contested probation issue or that the district judge did not approve of the magistrate's action. The court interpreted the record as showing that the magistrate did nothing more than follow the negotiated plea bargain, which agreed to a punishment of 180 days confinement in the county jail to be served on weekends with no mention of probation. The plea agreement failed to affirmatively mention probation, by indicating that it was to be granted or denied or considered by the magistrate without reference to the plea agreement. The court construed the record as showing that the magistrate did not consider the application for probation, but simply followed the negotiated plea arrangement. Additionally, the court found the lower court erroneously applied a presumption of irregularity. The court reversed and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the lower court that the statute in question as applied to appellant was unconstitutional, finding that the magistrate's denial of probation was simply another form denial, part of the plea bargain.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant district attorney sought by writ of mandamus to have a pretrial order entered by respondent trial judge of Harris County (Texas) set aside. Applicant alleged that respondent exceeded his authority in holding Tex. Penal Code &sect; 71.03&nbsp;unconstitutional and ordering six indictments dismissed with prejudice. Applicant requested that the court issue a writ of mandamus directing respondent to vacate its dismissal orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent had entered an order of dismissal with prejudice pursuant to defendants' motion. Respondent then entered an order dismissing with prejudice the remaining indictments and made it clear that he was ordering applicant not to refile charges. The motions to dismiss and subsequent orders were based upon the contention that the statute under which defendants had been charged was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The rule regarding mandamus was that mandamus would issue where there was but one proper order. The court found that it was of no moment whether respondent, in dismissing the indictments in the case sub judice, acted ministerially or without statutory authority. Since respondent had lost any jurisdiction over the causes and since the only manner in which respondent might re-obtain jurisdiction of these cases would be the return of grand jury indictments into respondent's court, the court held that mandamus did not lie. However, the court did find that respondent had usurped his authority by instructing applicant not to file further charges, and vacated that portion of respondent's prior orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that applicant was without any other remedy, and that mandamus was available as to the second portion of respondent's order. The court concluded that respondent would vacate that portion of his prior orders pertaining to the refiling of criminal complaints arising from those events alleged in the causes without the necessity of the issuance of a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator district attorney was prosecuting defendant for the charge of burglary of a habitation. Defendant expressed his desire to waive trial by jury in writing and orally. Relator refused to consent to the waiver. Respondent judge admitted defendant's waiver for purposes of the record only, stating the state had no right to due process of law. The court granted the district attorney's writ for mandamus ordering respondent judge to set the cause for a trial date, impanel a jury, and prohibited him from entering a judgment except upon verdict of a jury or upon consent of the state to waiver of a jury trial. The court held that the state does not have a right to a jury trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder. The court affirmed, finding that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a new trial because defendant did not present supporting affidavits or other evidence and, when the court reviewed the issue on federal constitutional grounds, it found that the prosecution did not fail to disclose exculpatory evidence where defendant was given the evidence before jury selection, which lasted for two weeks. The court found that the trial court did not err in admitting defendant's confession where there was ample evidence to support the police officers' contention that they did not promise leniency. The court found the indictment valid in that felony murder was not charged and sufficient in that it contained statutory language. Further, the court concluded that the trial court did not err in failing to give a special instruction on voluntary manslaughter, where defendant was not entitled to a voluntary manslaughter instruction because there was no evidence of sudden passion. Finally, the court concluded that evidence of the victim's good character was admissible under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.06 as it applied to capital murder.</SPAN></P>

It found that where an erroneous admonishment was given, substantial compliance was deemed to have occurred, and the burden shifted to petitioner to show that he entered his plea without understanding the consequences of such plea.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder. The jury assessed punishment at 10 years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court had erred in overruling his new trial motion, which was based in part on jury misconduct claims. The appellate court found sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction but ordered reversal based on jury misconduct. The State sought discretionary review, and the court reversed. The court adopted a five-prong test to measure whether any consideration by the jury of the possible impact of parole on actual time served was reversible error. Such a finding would require a showing that there was (1) a misstatement of the law; (2) asserted as a fact; (3) by one professing to know the law; (4) which was relied upon by other jurors; and (5) who for that reason changed their vote to a harsher punishment. The court ruled that the test was to apply to any claim of error based on alleged jury misconduct under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 43.03, &sect;&sect; 7 or 8, and overruled all contrary authority. The court held that because defendant had not shown the first three elements, he had failed to show reversible error and was not entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded. The court found that although the indictment could be interpreted to allege an offense under the law as it existed prior to the enactment of the new sentencing statute, the classification of the offense under the prior law was a third-degree felony, and under the new law it was classified as a second-degree felony. Because appellant was tried by a jury and could not have been convicted of a second-degree felony or assessed the same punishment under the law as it existed prior to the sentencing statute, the court was required to reverse the conviction.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, appellant argued his conviction was null and void because it was rendered in a district court that did not have criminal jurisdiction. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction, holding that appellant was correct in that the district court only had civil jurisdiction, but appellant's conviction actually too place in another district court that had no statutory prohibition against criminal jurisdiction. In seeking a petition for discretionary review of that decision, appellant continued to urge the lack of criminal jurisdiction. The court held that under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 199 &sect; 156(5), the judge of either district could hear and dispose of any suit or other proceeding on the docket of either court in which the action was instituted without the necessity of transferring the suit from one court to another. Further, the court noted that Tex. Const. Art. V, &sect; 11 provided that district judges could exchange districts when deemed expedient. The petition for discretionary review was denied.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held in favor of defendants' applications because defendants' punishment for each offense were determined by provisions contained in the Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, affirmed on appeal. Defendant sought discretionary review, and the court reversed because the trial court erroneously overruled his motion to discharge pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02, &sect; 3, in that the motion was filed the day before trial. The court held the statute was unambiguous that an art. 32A.02, &sect; 3 motion was to be filed before trial or defendant's speedy trial rights were waived, and there was no requirement as to the amount of time before trial that such a motion should be filed. The court held questions directed to the trial court's jurisdiction must be raised before trial proceedings began, and the party seeking to defeat the court's jurisdiction had the duty to launch his attack before that authority was exercised, particularly when the clear language of the governing procedural statute required the motion before trial began. The court also held defendant's motion was adequate because it informed the trial judge of the basis of his complaint, and the state could not allege a constitutional challenge to art. 32A.02, &sect; 3 because the claim was not raised with the lower court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petitioned for review of judgments affirmed by the Court of Appeals, First Supreme Judicial District of Texas (Harris County), which convicted him of violating the Polygraph Examiners Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4413(29cc). Appellant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions and asserted that the Act &sect;&sect; 4, 7 violated due process and equal protection and were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant received convictions under the Polygraph Examiners Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4413(29cc), for examining an employee without a license and by using a machine other than a polygraph. The court reversed the judgments of conviction and reformed it for acquittals. The court held the licensing requirement of the Act &sect; 4 and the classification scheme of the Act &sect; 7 that distinguished between the use of polygraphs and other similar devices were rationally related to the legitimate government purpose of public protection. Thus, the Act did not violate due process and equal protection by its discriminating against the use of devices other than the polygraph. The court determined that the Act &sect;&sect; 7, 26 only restricted commercial speech and consequently the doctrine of overbreadth did not apply. The court overruled appellant's contention that the Act was overbroad. The court construed the Act's term of &quot;instruments&quot; to mean machines that produced a visual display and found that the Act was not impermissibly vague. The court held that the evidence was insufficient to show that appellant used either an instrument or a psychological stress evaluator as prohibited by the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant's convictions of violating the polygraph law. The court held that insufficient evidence supported the convictions because appellant used neither an instrument nor a psychological stress evaluator. The court held that the law did not violate due process or equal protection because it was rationally related to a legitimate purpose. The law was not overbroad because it regulated commercial speech and was not vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals, Thirteenth Supreme Judicial District of Texas (Calhoun County), which upheld the validity of the search of defendant and seizure of methamphetamine from his person even though defendant was not an occupant of the premises being searched or named in the combination search and arrest warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was a non occupant, arrived at a home while the police were executing a combined search and arrest warrant at a residence and had already discovered narcotics in open view. An officer's frisk of defendant was fruitless. Another officer arrived at the residence and searched defendant a second time. The second search yielded methamphetamine. Defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance, methamphetamine, with intent to deliver. The court of appeals upheld the validity of the search and seizure of the controlled substance. On appeal, defendant maintained that the search was unconstitutional. The court initially noted that the warrant did not specifically authorize defendant's arrest. The court reasoned that defendant, who was not an occupant of the residence being searched, did not have any established connection with the drugs found in the house. The court did not think that the initial stop and frisk was justified. Even if it were justifiable, the court concluded that the fruits of the second frisk were inadmissible because the second search violated the U.S. Const. amend. IV and XIV and the Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment that upheld the validity of the search of defendant and seizure of methamphetamine from his person was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court. The evidence seized had to be suppressed because the search was unconstitutional where no nexus between defendant, who was a nonoccupant, and the contraband found in the residence being searched was established.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cause came before the court on a motion for rehearing by the state after a previous decision by the court reversed appellant's conviction in Harris County (Texas) for theft from a person and punishment of 10 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An indictment alleged that appellant appropriated property, cash money owned by the complainant, and stole the property from the person of the complainant. Appellant's conviction for theft from a person was reversed upon a finding that the trial court improperly refused a requested charge on misdemeanor theft of property pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(d)(2)(A). In that opinion, the court held that &sect; 31.03(d)(2)(A) could be a lesser included offense of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(d)(4)(B), the offense actually charged. Upon a motion for rehearing by the state, the court, in comparing the two offenses, found that under &sect; 31.03(d)(2)(A), the value of the property stolen must be established. Under &sect; 31.03(d)(4)(B), that requirement was not necessary. The court held that &sect; 31.03(d)(2)(A) was not a lesser included offense of &sect; 31.03(d)(4)(B). Further, the court held that the value of property stolen was an essential element of the offense. As such, appellant was not entitled to a charge on misdemeanor theft as a lesser included offense of theft from the person. The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed its prior ruling on the cause and affirmed the judgment of the trial court to convict appellant of theft from a person. Appellant was not entitled to a jury charge on a misdemeanor theft as a lesser included offense of theft from a person when the actual value of the property stolen was an essential element of the offense.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed the conviction on the basis of fundamental error in the jury charge, and the court granted the state's petition for discretionary review so that it could reconsider one of its previous holdings. The court observed that it was clear that where it was alleged, proven, and found that a defendant intentionally or knowingly placed the owner in fear of imminent bodily injury or death in the course of a taking, a charge was not defective for failing to require that the jury separately find the taking to have been without the effective consent of the owner. In reversing the appellate court's decision, the court found that the appellate court erred in reversing appellant's conviction due to fundamental error and that appellant had failed to perfect error in the charge by not objecting to the fact that the charge omitted the phrase &quot;without the owner's effective consent.&quot; The court also held that no conflict existed between Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.01 (1981) and Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 26. It remanded the case for consideration of appellant's other grounds.</SPAN></P>

The trial court set aside the complaint for public intoxication, then proceeded on the complaint for possession of cocaine. Appellant sought dismissal of the cocaine indictment, complaining that the public intoxication and possession of cocaine offenses were of the same transaction. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgment of conviction. On discretionary review, the court held that when a person was detained, placed under restraint, or taken into custody by a peace officer, all such chargeable voluntary conduct in which the person was then and there engaged, constituting an offense continuing in nature, arose out of the same transaction. Accordingly, given the facts and circumstances recounted by the peace officer, the court found that offense of possession of cocaine and the offense of public intoxication, being committed contemporaneously by appellant, were of the same transaction.

The appellate court held that without the presumptions created by &sect; 43.23(e) and (f), there was sufficient evidence to convict appellant under the valid sections of &sect; 43.23. However, the appellate court held that the trial court's charge on the effect of &sect; 43.23(e) and (f) constituted reversible error. Thereafter, the state filed a petition for discretionary review. The court concluded that the error found by the appellate court in the charge to the jury with respect to the presumptions was not reversible error because the appellate court also found that even without application of the presumptions, the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant. The court therefore did not need to address the holding that &sect; 43.23(e) and (f) was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State sought a rehearing after the decision of a trial court in Harris County (Texas) that granted appellant relief from a 12-year sentence assessed by the trial court when appellant had previously agreed to a plea bargain for the lesser sentence in exchange for his guilty plea to aggravated robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State sought a rehearing after appellant was granted relief from his sentence in his second trial for the offense of aggravated robbery. The appellate court denied the rehearing request finding that state erred in failing to procure the proper documentation in the original proceeding and that there was no evidence that appellant failed to comply with the terms of the plea bargain. Appellant entered into a plea bargain with state, compiled with its terms and conditions, and was sentenced appropriately. Later, when state could not located a waiver of indictment, state, without appellant's consent, filed a motion for a new trial on appellant's behalf. When appellant failed to sign a waiver of indictment in this new proceeding, state revoked its plea bargain, and appellant was assessed a sentence in excess of the one previously agreed to in the plea bargain. The court found that due process of law prohibited vindictiveness against a defendant who successfully attached a conviction. Here, appellant was successful in having his sentence in the second proceeding reduced to comply with the terms of the plea bargain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled state's motion for a rehearing and remanded the case for a reassessment of punishment, holding that state failed to establish that appellant rejected the original plea offer because the record indicated that prosecutor amended the terms of the offer and, consequently, did not offer appellant the same deal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment, which the court affirmed. On certiorari, the Supreme Court reversed the court's original opinion and judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. Defendant asked on remand that his questions be answered regarding whether the court had relied upon the U.S. Constitution or the Texas Constitution in making its decision, and if it relied on the Fourth Amendment, whether the Texas Constitution provided an independent basis supporting the court's conclusion. The court stated that its opinion rested squarely on the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment and that the Texas Constitution did not provide a more restrictive standard of protection than that provided by the Fourth Amendment. The court recognized that states were free to accept or reject federal holdings and to set such standards as they deemed appropriate so long as the state action did not fall below the minimum standards provided by the federal constitutional protections. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court concluded that it was not the function of the judiciary to engraft such changes in the Texas Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state requested review of the decision of the Court of Appeals, Third Supreme Judicial District of Texas (Fayette County), which declared that H.B. 730, 67th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Tex. 1981), was unconstitutional and therefore did not amend the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15 (1982), under which appellants were charged with aggravated possession of marijuana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were charged with the offense of aggravated possession of marijuana pursuant to a modification of the Texas Controlled Substances Act (the Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15 (1982), by H.B. 730, 67th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Tex. 1981). Appellants filed a pre-trial writ of habeas corpus attacking the constitutionality of H.B. 730. After the trial court denied them relief, appellants sought relief in the court of appeals. The lower court declared that H.B. 730 was unconstitutional, but upheld the indictments against appellants under the pre-amendment version of the Act. The state sought review of the lower court's holding. The court agreed that the caption to H.B. 730 lacked the specificity required by Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35 (1955), because an average person would not be put on notice that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect;&sect; 3, 3(f)(c), and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.04(b), (c), were also modified. The court, in affirming the judgment below, held that the original version of the Act remained in effect and that under it, the charge in the indictment was still an offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, which had declared that the legislative bill that purported to amend the Texas Controlled Substance Act, under which appellants were charged with aggravated possession of marijuana, was unconstitutional because the caption of the bill failed to give notice of its modification of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. Appellants could be charged under the law as it existed prior to amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with possession of marijuana in a usable quantity of less than two ounces. Appellant pleaded guilty to the offense and punishment was assessed at six months confinement, probated, and a fine.

The trial court revoked appellant's probation and sentenced him to 90 days confinement. The appellate court affirmed appellant's conviction. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in convicting him of the offense because possession of marijuana was no longer a crime due to the unconstitutionality of the Texas Controlled Substance Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15 &sect; 4.05 (1976). The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, because when appellant committed the offense, there was a valid statute in effect, which made it a criminal offense to possess two ounces or less of marijuana. The court further held that because appellant was convicted under a valid statute, his probation was properly revoked upon proof that he had violated the terms and conditions of his release by driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his accomplice were arrested for intentionally causing the death of a man by shooting him with a gun in the course of committing and attempting to commit a robbery. The medical examiner could not determine whether the bullet came from a gun carried by defendant or his accomplice. Defendant was convicted and punishment was assessed at death. On appeal, defendant complained that the trial court erred by instructing veniremen that the law of parties could be used in answering a special issue at the punishment stage. The special issue referred to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 (b)(1). The court affirmed the judgment because the prosecutor only asked the veniremen if he or she understood that under the circumstances of a hypothetical that the law of parties made two people liable for the actions of one. Veniremen who stated they could not impose the death penalty were properly excused. The shirt worn by the victim was admissible to emphasize points made by a testifying chemist. The charge properly defined murder and capital murder for the jury. There was ample evidence that defendant killed, attempted to kill or intended to kill the victim.</SPAN></P>

Appellant entered a guilty plea, and the trial judge instructed the jury to return a guilty verdict.

On appeal, the court held that appellant's challenges to his indictment were without merit, and that due to his plea, appellant had waived any errors regarding witnesses' identification testimonies, and the trial judge's directed verdict to the jury was proper. The court found with regard to appellant's sentence that the evidence presented during sentencing did not deny appellant due process or equal protection in the absence of unfair surprise, that photographic evidence was admissible because it reflected verbal testimony that had been admitted, and that the jury's finding that appellant was a continuing threat to society was sufficiently supported by the evidence.

The court rejected defendant's challenge to the language of the indictment, finding that any error was waived. Defendant also waived his challenge, on equal protection grounds, to the search warrant statute. The court turned away a defense objection to the manner in which a blood sample was obtained, and the court sustained the lower court's ruling as to evidence of extraneous offenses, which were admissible on the question of identity. Lay testimony as to defendant's future dangerousness was also properly admitted, and the lower court's refusal to define &quot;deliberate&quot; or &quot;deliberately&quot; in the jury charge was also sustained because the words had an ordinary meaning.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possession of gambling paraphernalia and assessed a $ 150 fine.

A vice squad officer testified without objection that line sheets were used in betting on football games, and that a line was a point spread on a game. Under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 47.08, proof that an actor possessed gambling paraphernalia was prima facie evidence that the actor did so knowingly and with the intent to further gambling. The appellate court found that the line sheets in appellant's possession along with the prima facie evidence provision of Tex.

His conviction and sentence were automatically appealed, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(f). The court affirmed the conviction and sentence below. The court rejected defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of evidence supporting the finding of future dangerousness because defendant's own accounts of his involvement in two capital murders and the surrounding circumstances provided sufficient evidence to support the finding. The court also rejected defendant's claim that certain evidence should have been suppressed as having been obtained by unreasonable search and seizure because defendant's father, who asserted control over the house, freely and voluntarily gave informed consent to the officers' entry and to their removal of a weapon found in defendant's room. The court also rejected defendant's general challenges to evidentiary rulings, to the constitutionality of the state's death penalty statute, and to certain jury charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought by discretionary review the review of a decision from the 10th Supreme District Court of Appeals, Harris County, Texas, which affirmed the lower court's judgment convicting defendant of promoting obscenity by exhibiting an obscene film to an officer, sentencing defendant to three days in jail, and fining defendant under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover officer entered a bookstore where defendant was an employee. The undercover officer obtained change from defendant. The officer then went into a booth and viewed a film that was allegedly obscene. Defendant was not present with the officer and had nothing whatsoever to do with activating or operating the projector. Defendant was found guilty of obscenity by exhibiting to the undercover officer an obscene film, sentenced to three days in jail, and fined. Defendant sought review of the decision, and the appellate court, under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(e), affirmed. Defendant sought further discretionary review. The court reversed, holding that it was crystal clear that without invoking and applying the invalid presumption under &sect; 43.23(e), defendant should not have been convicted of promoting by exhibiting the obscene film. The court determined that other than defendant's act of giving change to the officer, there was no evidence that defendant promoted obscenity by exhibiting the obscene film, and that by doing so he had guilty knowledge of the content and character of the film. Therefore, the court held that defendant was entitled to an acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's decision affirming defendant's conviction of promoting obscenity by exhibiting an obscene film to an officer, and his sentence thereon. The court held that absent the reliance upon an invalid presumption in the statutory law, there was no proof that defendant knew the character or content of the obscene film.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.02(a)(2), and a panel of the court reversed. The state filed a motion for an en banc rehearing which the court granted. The court withdrew the panel opinion, and affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that the indictment sufficiently supplied the culpable mental state required by Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 6.02. The indictment stated that defendant acted in a manner intending to cause serious bodily harm. The first element of prosecution of murder under &sect; 19.02(a)(2) was met when defendant intended to cause serious bodily injury and committed an act clearly dangerous to human life that caused the victim's death. The state had to show that defendant acted with the conscious objective or desire to create a substantial risk of death, permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment, which caused the death of the individual. The second element of prosecution under &sect; 19.02(a)(2) required a showing that defendant committed an act clearly, objectively dangerous to human life. The culpable mental state was focused on the result and not on the conduct that caused the result.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of promoting by exhibiting to a police officer obscene material because of a movie playing at a theater at which defendant worked as a cashier.

The lower court reversed defendant's conviction, finding the evidence was insufficient and ruling that Tex.

The state filed a petition for discretionary review. The court affirmed but disagreed as to the reasons the lower court used to reach the result. The court found that it was unnecessary for the lower court to have addressed and discussed the validity of the legal presumption stated in &sect; 43.23(e) because regardless of the applicability of the presumption stated in &sect; 43.23 (e), no rational trier of fact could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, either acting individually or as a party, of unlawfully and knowing the content and character of the material.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State petitioned for discretionary review of the judgment of the Texas Appeals Court, Houston (1st District), that reversed defendant's conviction for a violation of the Texas obscenity law, Tex. Penal Code &sect; 43.23(c), by selling an obscene magazine. The petition was granted to evaluate whether the lower court correctly held that the trial court erroneously charged the jury on obscenity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in part, holding that the jury charge improperly eliminated the State's burden of proving that the material alleged to be obscene was patently offensive by describing the magazine as containing patently offensive material. The court reversed the holding that the trial court failed to define &quot;prurient interest.&quot; The lack of a definition in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21(a) did not render the statute constitutionally defective and did not require the trial court to provide a definition. &quot;Patently offensive,&quot; defined in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21(a)(4) as an affront to current community standards of decency, was not overly vague where the term &quot;decency&quot; was not defined. A three-part test determined whether printed material was protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, and Tex. Penal Code &sect; 43.21 provided a four-part test to determine whether material was obscene. The jury was deciding what the average person in his community considered obscene, and the term &quot;decency&quot; merely provided a guide.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the State's petition for discretionary review. The court affirmed in part as the trial court erred in describing the magazine that defendant sold as patently offensive. The court reversed in part because definitions of the terms &quot;prurient&quot; and &quot;descent&quot; did not render the obscenity statute overly vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant convict was found guilty of prostitution. She sought review, arguing that under Tex. Penal Code &sect; 43.02(a)(1), the term &quot;offer&quot; was unconstitutionally vague, that the trial court erred in not granting her motion to quash the information because the term &quot;offer&quot; denied her sufficient notice of the charges against her, that the evidence that she offered to engage in sexual conduct was insufficient and that the trial court erred in allowing a question that called for a legal conclusion. The court affirmed, noting that the constitutional issue had previously been overruled, that the information gave sufficient notice of what appellant had offered, that the evidence showed that although the officer may have made the first offer it was sufficient to show that in the course of protracted negotiations appellant did make an offer and finally even if the question did call for a legal conclusion the trial was to the court and therefore the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of obscenity under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23. The Court of Appeals reversed defendant's conviction due to the trial court's failure to charge the jury on the consequences of a presumption under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 2.05. Defendant petitioned the court for discretionary review and contended that &sect; 43.23 was unconstitutional and that the search warrant in her case was invalid. The court refused defendant's petition for discretionary review and held that it was well established that the constitutionality of a statute would not be determined in any case unless such a determination was absolutely necessary to decide the case in which the issue was raised. The court determined that the Court of Appeals was not required to address the constitutional questions presented by defendant with regard to &sect; 43.23 or to address the issue concerning the validity of the search warrant. The court expressed no opinion with respect to the disposition of the grounds for error which the Court of Appeals found to be without merit, but agreed that the judgment had to be reversed due to the trial court's failure to properly charge the jury under &sect; 2.05.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a court in Dallas County (Texas) of murdering his wife. On appeal, he complained that the trial court erred in overruling his request for court-appointed experts and investigators in excess of the limit of $ 500 set by statute, that the court should have let in testimony regarding what he said when administered a form of truth serum, and that the deferred adjudication statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murdering his wife. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that his due process and equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV were not violated when the trial court overruled his motion for court-appointed experts and investigators in excess of the $ 500 limit of Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 26.05, &sect; 1(d), because he failed to show, by way of evidence in the record, how he was harmed or injured by such action. The court also held that there was no error in excluding testimony as to the results of a Brevital examination of appellant. The results of other &quot;truth serum&quot; tests were inadmissible as evidence, because they had not yet attained scientific acceptance as reliable and accurate means of ascertaining truth or deception. Therefore, this test result must be inadmissible as well. The court also held that the trial court's lack of power to assess unadjudicated probation in this case did not violate defendant's rights under the United States and Texas Constitutions. The fact that offering deferred adjudication may encourage a defendant to plead guilty does not render it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for murder. The court held that defendant showed no harm in being limited on costs of experts and investigators, the court did not err in excluding the Brevital-induced testimony because similar truth serum tests have been excluded, and allowing some defendants but not others to receive deferred adjudication violated noone's due process rights, even though it may encourage some defendants to plead guilty.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review on grounds that a juror was improperly excluded. The court reversed the trial court's judgment of conviction and remanded the cause. The court held that the death penalty could not be carried out if even one prospective juror was excused for cause based solely on the juror's opposition to the death penalty, unless that opposition resulted in an inability to follow the law. A prospective juror could only be excluded if the juror would automatically vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to the evidence and the juror's attitude would prevent an impartial decision as to appellant's guilt. The court held that the juror was improperly excused for cause because the juror would have answered all of the special issues regarding the death penalty truthfully despite the juror's feelings against the death penalty. Although the juror's feelings toward the death penalty were relevant to allow the state to exercise a peremptory challenge, that was an insufficient reason for the trial court to sustain the state's challenge for cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted 10 points of error in his conviction for commercial obscenity in showing a pornographic film. The court found no error and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the trial court did not commit error when it advised potential jurors that the case would include viewing a potentially pornographic film. Jury instructions were also without error and special verdict forms did not violate Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 37.07 requiring all verdicts be general. The court found that the fact that the film in question was copyrighted had no bearing on whether it was obscene material since the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4 (1970) did not preclude obscene material from copyright. The court further held that while it was error for the prosecutor to interject his personal opinion during argument, that error had been cured by an instruction to the jury to disregard. Finally, the court held that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 43.21, 43.23 dealing with obscenity were not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the trial court had not erred by refusing to admit circumstantial evidence concerning the involuntary nature of defendant's confession because defendant's self-serving remark made three days after his oral confession was not covered by Tex.

His conviction was affirmed on appeal, and he filed a motion for rehearing, contending that the court erred in applying an incorrect version of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.13, &sect; 3d(a). He argued that the trial court erred in assessing a fine when placing him on deferred adjudication because the provisions of art. 42.13, &sect; 3d(a), in effect at the time he entered his guilty plea, did not specifically authorize imposition of a fine as a condition of probation when deferred adjudication was utilized. In overruling the motion for rehearing, the court declined to decide whether the court exceeded its authority in imposing the fine because any error was not reversible error. The court held that the mere imposition of an unauthorized condition of probation, which was not utilized as the basis of a subsequent revocation, could not be used to set aside an otherwise valid conviction. Defendant's claim that art. 42.13, &sect; 3d, was unconstitutional was meritless because he could not complain about receiving something to which he was not entitled.</SPAN></P>

And there was insufficient evidence to convict him of rape. The court held that women were entitled to control over their persons. Under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.13, evidence of victim's past sexual conduct was not admissible. Under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.02, the evidence was sufficient to convict, if the state proved that the intercourse was without the victim's consent because appellant compelled her to submit by force that overcame her earnest resistance. The evidence presented was ample to support the findings that appellant had sexual intercourse with the victim without consent by his use of force and threats. Appellant argued the statute was unconstitutional as it denied him equal protection, by condemning conduct of men only. Although the statute was not gender neutral, the classification bore a substantial relationship to the government purpose of protecting women. Thus, the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were convicted of possession of more than four ounces of marihuana and each was sentenced to four years imprisonment. The sole ground of error advanced by appellants was that the trial court erred in overruling a motion to suppress the evidence obtained under a search warrant. Appellants asserted that the information showing probable cause to support the warrant was obtained by an unlawful warrantless search. The affidavit supporting the warrant recited that the affiant had observed through a telescopic lens that there were marihuana plants growing in the greenhouse on the property. Appellants contended that the telescopic observation of the greenhouse was an unconstitutional search. After consideration, the court concluded that the telescopic observation of the greenhouse was not a search under U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court affirmed the judgments of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the testimony of any one of the jurors who testified that the discussion of the parole laws caused them to vote for a harsher punishment for appellant was sufficient to show that appellant was denied a fair and impartial trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of drugs pursuant to a municipal ordinance. The court reversed the conviction and ordered the cause dismissed. The court held that since the complaint in this case could have been prosecuted in municipal court only under the terms of a municipal ordinance, and the record failed to show the existence and terms of such an ordinance, that the record therefore failed to show that either of the previous courts had jurisdiction to enter judgments of conviction against defendant. The court held that state courts did not take judicial notice of the existence of city ordinances or their terms, and that where they were relied upon, proof of them was essential. In this case, the state did not prove the existence or terms of a municipal ordinance prohibiting the conduct with which defendant was charged.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's appointed counsel filed a further petition for discretionary review requesting that the court examine the record for error. The court held that defendant had no right to demand that his appointed counsel file a petition for discretionary review and found that counsel had no duty to file it. The court stated that the filing of a petition for discretionary review should be far from a routine matter and that such a petition would only be granted if it met one of the criteria found at Tex. Cr. App. R. 302(c). The court held that although U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of an order by a Jefferson County trial court (Texas) which entered a conviction for the misdemeanor offense of driving while intoxicated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant enter a plea of guilty to the misdemeanor offense of driving while intoxicated and was placed on probation for one year pursuant to the provisions of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.13, &sect;3d(a) without an adjudication of guilt. The State subsequently filed a motion to revoke probation. Appellant contended that he was denied due process of law as the hearing to revoke his probation was held after his term of probation had expired. The court found that the motion to revoke was filed and the capias issued prior to the expiration of the probation period; therefore, the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the motion and revoke the probation although the period of probation had expired before the hearing. The court held that appellant failed to assert his right to a speedy trial and had not shown prejudice due to a delay. Furthermore the court held that a fine was allowed under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.13 along with the reasonable terms and conditions of probate. Lastly, the court found that the term probation used in art. 42.13, &sect;2(4), which required an adjudication of guilt, was not the exclusive definition of probation throughout the act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court's judgment of conviction for the misdemeanor offense of driving while intoxicated was affirmed because appellant was not denied due process of law when his probation revocation hearing was held after his term of probation had expired, the fine was appropriately imposed, and the definition of probation under the statute was not in conflict with itself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a trial court in Jefferson County (Texas), which convicted defendant of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.05. On original submission, the court of criminal appeals ruled that it was fundamental and reversible error for the trial court to omit from a jury charge the required culpable mental state. The state filed a motion for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, Tex. Penal Code Ann. 46.05, did not contain a culpable mental state provision. However, one was required under Tex. Penal Code Ann. 6.02. The charging instrument alleged two mental states, intentional and knowingly. However, the trial court did not include in its application of the law to the facts paragraph of the jury charge either of the culpable mental states. Defendant was convicted of the offense. The cause was reversed by the criminal court of appeals. The state filed a motion for rehearing, which was denied. The failure to list a required element of the offense was a fatal error. The trial court's abstract instructions including terms such as &quot;possession&quot; and &quot;consent&quot; could not cure the error. It was the appellate court's legal duty under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 36.19 to review the charge. The failure to apply the law to the facts infringed on defendant's right to a fair jury trial. The general rule that the charge should be read as a whole did not apply where the entire element was omitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's motion for rehearing denied following the criminal court of appeals reversal of defendant's conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm. The trial court's failure to include a culpable mental state in its application of the law to the facts paragraph of the jury charge was a reversible error because it eliminated an essential element and infringed on defendant's right to a fair jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found competent to stand trial in a Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 46.02, &sect; 4, jury competency hearing, and was thereafter convicted of capital murder. Punishment was assessed at death. On appeal, the sufficiency of the evidence was not challenged. The court found that the trial court did not commit reversible error by allowing appellant's former girlfriend to testify against appellant. The girlfriend did not qualify as appellant's common-law wife. The court additionally determined that, in the totality of the circumstances, appellant's former girlfriend voluntarily consented to the search of the house she shared with appellant. The court found that even if error was committed in admitting the items seized from the search of the house or the truck or both, such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, in light of the other evidence. Furthermore, the testing of blood from the porch and exterior of the house should not have been suppressed because appellant had no expectation of privacy in those areas. However, the trial court erred in refusing to allow appellant to testify at his competency hearing. Therefore, the appeal was abated and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

Film from an in-store security camera was used to identify defendant, a juvenile, and he was convicted of aggravated robbery. The court of criminal appeals affirmed. The trial court did not err in admitting photographs and the film. The witness who verified the film and photographs, a police photographer, did not have to be the same person who actually took the film or photographs. There was no evidence of tampering. The State was not required to show the details of the film and photographic development process. The use of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 51.09(b)(1) warnings before defendant's questioning by police were sufficient and satisfied the Miranda test. Defendant understood the warnings and voluntarily confessed. The denial of a mistrial based on alleged improper jury argument was correct. The State's argument was improper because it referred to the possibility of an extraneous offense, but the trial court cured the error with an instruction to disregard.</SPAN></P>

He purchased a ticket from appellant and watched all three features.

He then went back to the drive-in, executed the arrest warrants, and confiscated the films. Appellant was charged with the offense of commercially exhibiting obscene material under Tex.

The jury convicted appellant.

The court also held that appellant was not denied her right under the Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02 because appellant filed her motion to set aside the charge only 12 days after the Speedy Trial Act went into effect. The court also held that Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order of the Dallas County trial court (Texas), which on his guilty plea, pursuant to a plea bargain, entered his conviction for credit card abuse under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of credit card abuse on his guilty plea pursuant to a plea bargain. On appeal, he argued that the trial court erred for various reasons when it denied his motion to quash the indictment. Because the circumstances surrounding the plea bargain were scrupulously fair, the court rejected the procedural grounds defendant advanced. The court analyzed defendant's claim that the statute proscribing credit card fraud, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.31(b)(1)(B), was unconstitutionally vague because it did not sufficiently define the terms &quot;presents or uses,&quot; thereby making it impossible to determine whether what was denounced was presenting and using a revoked or cancelled credit card for payment or for identification. The court held that &sect; 32.31(b)(1)(B) aimed to eradicate theft, whose essence was scienter: intent to obtain property fraudulently with knowledge that the credit card had been revoked or cancelled. In this context, the court held that there was nothing vague in describing the act that was an element of the offense as &quot;presents or uses,&quot; for they were words of such common usage that the simple act of presenting or using could be clearly understood.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction because the penal statute under which defendant was convicted for credit card abuse was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute proscribed theft, and in this context there could be no confusion that the words &quot;presents or uses&quot; a revoked credit card meant for purposes of stealing rather than for identification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Eight months after convicting appellant of theft and placing appellant on probation, the state filed a motion to revoke appellant's probation, and the trial court continued appellant's probation hearing for 90 days. The trial court, without hearing any evidence, taking any testimony or making any findings of fact, summarily entered an order revoking appellant's probation, and imposed the previously suspended two year sentence. The court reversed appellant's revocation of probation, finding that appellant, who had been returned to probation after a hearing, retained the valuable liberty of probation and the due process protection of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The statutory justification for the continuance contemplated a short period of time before concluding the hearing and not appellant's return to probation. The fact that appellant received his liberty through a break had no significance in the due process and due course of law considerations. The trial court acted arbitrarily when it revoked probation without any determination of a new violation, and thus appellant's due process rights were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that summarily revoked appellant's probation after continuing appellant probation hearing for 90 days because the procedure of continuing a hearing and then revoking probation without additional probation violations violated appellant's right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state and defendant both filed motions for rehearing after the court reversed defendant's conviction for capital murder because of error in the admission of testimony at the punishment stage of defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant abducted, raped, and stabbed the victim to death. He attempted to throw away the murder weapon when stopped and released on an unrelated matter. Police later asked him to come to the police station and told him he was free to leave. He answered numerous questions and gave fingerprints. He was arrested after a fingerprint match and was given his warnings. He eventually confessed. The court held that under all the circumstances, a reasonable person would have believed that he was free to leave, so he initially was not seized. The court held that the sufficiency of the warnings required by Miranda and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22, and the voluntariness of the waiver of the rights protected by those warnings were two distinct and separate requirements which had to be met for a confession to be admissible. Without the predicate of proper warnings, even a voluntary confession was inadmissible; however, the entire record showed defendant was given the functional equivalent of the required warnings. Since the imposition of the death penalty was no longer possible, and there was no error in the guilt-innocence phase of the trial, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's capital murder conviction and held that under all the circumstances, defendant was free to leave and not seized when he was initially interrogated. While police should have either read the warnings or taken him to a magistrate for the reading of rights, defendant received the functional equivalent. The court declined to reform the sentence because the governor already had commuted it to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged her conviction for murder and her assessed punishment of 15 years of confinement. Appellant contested the admissibility of her written confession, claiming it was tainted by a warrantless arrest conducted by Louisiana police officers. The court found that a warrantless arrest absent exigent circumstances should not be given retroactive application. The court held that if the arrest had occurred in Texas, the subsequent confession would have been suppressed, not because it was not probative or unreliable or mistrusted by the court, but to deter future police conduct violating Texas law. Since application of the exclusionary rule would have served no function in this instance, the court found no error in admitting the confession. The state's motion for rehearing was granted and the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's first trial ended in a mistrial during jury selection. The second ended in a mistrial on defense motion when a prosecutor elicited testimony from an officer about a suppressed statement. The third ended his conviction for capital murder with a death sentence. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction because the defendant was entitled to a change of venue as a matter of law when a properly supported motion under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 31.03 was not contested. The admission of testimony by two court-appointed mental health experts, who interviewed defendant at jail without Miranda or other warnings, for use by the prosecution, violated defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. V, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Tex. Const. art 1, &sect; 10. Jeopardy did not attach before the first mistrial, when the jury was not impaneled and sworn, and the second mistrial did not involve prosecutorial misconduct, so double jeopardy was not violated. The court balanced the length of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant, and held that his speedy trial right under U.S. Const. amend. VI was not violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for capital murder and remanded because the denial of an uncontroverted motion to change venue was reversible error.

Defendant also contended that the evidence was insufficient to show that the customer was intoxicated at the time of the alleged sale. The court affirmed, holding that as intoxication was not defined, the term was to be given its commonly understood meaning and thus, &sect; 101.63 was not defective. The court found that the type and location of the premises where the offense occurred were not elements of the offense and did not need to be alleged. The court ruled that the testimony of two police officers that the customer was intoxicated was sufficient evidence to show he was in such condition at the time of the alleged sale.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 71.01(b). The court further found that the indictment made the necessary punishment allegations as Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 71.02(c) clearly referred to the offenses listed in specific subdivisions which included delivery of marihuana. The court ruled that the indictment was not duplicitous because when the allegation of one offense necessarily included another offense, no violation of the duplicitous pleading rule occurred. The court held that &sect; 71.02 was constitutional as there was no vagueness. The court also found &sect; 71.02 was not unconstitutional due to the punishment ranges and object offense being defined in the Controlled Substances Act because the punishment applicable to an offense under &sect; 71.02 was fixed under Chapter 12 of the Penal Code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions because the indictment was not required to allege conspiracy in order to prosecute defendants for engaging in organized criminal activity, nor did the indictment fail to make the necessary allegations, as the statute alleged made it clear that the offenses defendants conspired to commit were the offenses listed in specific subdivisions. The court found the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The jury answered two special issues affirmatively pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 37.071, and assessed punishment at death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant and co-defendant's commission of a robbery, a security guard was shot and killed after the guard allegedly pulled his gun and shot at defendant. Defendant was convicted of capital murder for the offense, and the court affirmed the conviction because the sufficiency of the evidence was not challenged and the court found no reversible error. Although defendant would have been entitled to an instruction on provocation, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(3), he failed to request it and because the omission did not constitute fundamental error, the court found that defendant waived his challenge. The court also found that defendant waived a challenge to the admission of extraneous evidence and to the exclusion of his witness testifying as to defendant's reputation because he failed to object at trial to the trial court's action. The court further found that there was no error because the witness was basing his testimony on his personal encounters and not defendant's reputation within the community. The court found that defendant had constitutionally effective assistance of counsel based upon the record as a whole.</SPAN></P>

The court held that in the context of a labor dispute, &sect; 1(2) was intended to prevent violence by regulating the number and location of pickets and by prohibiting the obstruction of traffic to and from the struck premises, and thus the state interest in &sect; 1(2) was significant. The court held that the risk of interference with the federal scheme was virtually nonexistent; thus, the state court jurisdiction over the charged offense had not been preempted by the federal National Labor Relations Act. The court further held that &sect; 1(2) penalized obstructions which were brought about by any means. The court held that the construction of &sect; 1(2) criminalized only complete or unreasonably severe restrictions upon ingress or egress and therefore was not overbroad.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted by a jury of the offense of rape of a child. The trial court assessed punishment at two years, probated. Appellant complained that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.09 was unconstitutional in that it violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Appellant also contended that both the indictment and charge to the jury were fundamentally defective in that they failed to allege or require a finding that appellant knew the prosecutrix was under the age of 17. The court concluded that appellant waived the constitutional ground of error at the time of oral argument. The indictment and charge sufficiently required appellee, the state, to show appellant knowingly engaged in the sexual intercourse. It did not require appellee to show that appellant knew the victim to be younger than 17. To have required appellee to allege and prove the appellant knew the prosecutrix to have been under the age of 17 would have established ignorance or mistake as a defense in contravention of the clear legislative intent. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of capital murder and accordingly the punishment was assessed at death. In Texas, there is a general proposition that a juror could not be challenged for cause based on his views about capital punishment unless those views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath. The state may insist, however, that jurors will consider and decide the facts impartially and conscientiously apply the law as charged by the court. The court concluded that the aforementioned venire members were unable or unwilling to consider the statutory special issues with the degree of impartiality to which the state was entitled. The court affirmed for this and other reasons, finding that the record adequately demonstrated that these venire members' views about capital punishment would have prevented or substantially impaired the performance of their duties as jurors in accordance with their instructions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because the court concluded that the trial court did not err in excusing the prospective jurors for cause in a death penalty case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded appellants' convictions for unlawful and knowing possession of certain gambling paraphernalia with intent to further gambling in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 47.07. The court held that the charging instruments were sufficient to state an offense under &sect; 47.07 and, therefore, were not void for failure to state an offense because it was possession of the bingo cards, with intent to further gambling, which constituted the offense, and not mere possession accompanied by an unlawful purpose. However, the court held that the legal effect of the charge given was to allow the jury to find appellants guilty of a crime solely upon a finding that appellants possessed bingo cards. The practical effect of such instruction was to nullify the constitutional privilege that appellants need not testify in a criminal trial, and the charge amounted to decisive, unanswerable comment on appellants' right of self-incrimination as guaranteed by both the state and federal constitutions. The trial court's charge lowered the state's burden of proof to prove each material element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then entered a plea of nolo contendere and was found guilty by the lower court. This appeal followed. Defendant challenged the validity of the search warrant that was used to obtain the evidence that caused him to be convicted of the alleged offense. Defendant argued that the affidavit did not reflect adequate probable cause. The court agreed. The court found that the facts, as stated in the affidavit, did not furnish sufficient information to the issuing magistrate to establish probable cause because the information was conclusory in nature and unsupported by sufficient underlying facts. The fact that a marihuana source visited defendant's residence and observed a white substance claimed to be speed did not, without more, constitute probable cause to later search that residence for the controlled substance methamphetamine.

The lower court convicted defendant of possession of hydromorphone, a controlled substance. Defendant challenged his conviction, asserting that the arrest and subsequent search was unlawful. The court affirmed defendant's conviction because defendant did not possess a reasonable expectation of privacy in the doctor's waiting room, and he exhibited unusual behavior after the arrest warning had been given and, therefore, the hydromorphone was not the fruit of an illegal search.

Further, because officers had probable cause to believe appellant was driving and in possession of a stolen vehicle, the searches made incident to appellant's arrest and the impoundment of the vehicle were lawful, despite the fact that a subsequent investigation revealed that the automobile was not stolen. Appellant's argument regarding the constitutionality of &sect; 12.42(d) was without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting and sentencing appellant for burglary of a habitation. The court found the evidence was sufficient to sustain appellant's conviction, evidence obtained in searches incident to appellant's arrest and the impoundment of his vehicle was properly admitted, the statute under which appellant was sentenced was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of sexual abuse of a child, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.10 (&sect; 21.10), for engaging in homosexual conduct with a 13-year-old child. On appeal, appellant claimed that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to quash the indictment because &sect; 21.10 was unconstitutional in that it limited the promiscuity defense of &sect; 21.10(b) to heterosexual conduct. Appellant claimed the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it discriminated against him on the basis of sexual preference. The appellate court rejected appellant's claim and affirmed. The &sect; 21.10(b) defense only applied where a child was 14 years of age or older at the time of the offense. Hence, appellant lacked standing to challenge the statute's constitutionality because, even if he had been engaged in heterosexual conduct, he could not have asserted the defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the decision of a trial court in Harris County (Texas), which convicted defendant of refusing to allow a peace officer to examine and make copies of the books, accounts, papers, correspondence, and records of a licensed pawnshop in violation of V.A.C.S. art. 5069-51.08 (1978) of the Texas Pawnshop Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned a pawnshop. Defendant refused to allow a police officer to inspect his records without a search warrant. Defendant was convicted of refusing to allow a peace officer to examine and make copies of the books, accounts, papers, correspondence, and records of a licensed pawnshop in violation of V.A.C.S. art. 5069-51.08 (1978) of the Texas Pawnshop Act. The court of criminal appeals affirmed. A search warrant was not required for an administrative search of a closely regulated business. Like liquor and firearm dealers, the state had an interest in regulating pawnshops for the public welfare. Pawnshops were often used to disburse stolen goods and defraud the public. Defendant's contention that the charging information did not allege the purpose and authority of the searching officer's request was raised for the first time on appeal and was waived. The information alleged with particularity the items sought to be inspected to place defendant on notice. Defendant failed to object with particularity to a certificate of facts stating that he had been issued a pawnshop license, and thus the issue was not preserved.</SPAN></P>

The court held that these extraneous offenses were admissible to prove two elements of the offense under &sect; 37.03, that he made the statement knowing its meaning and intended to deceive the grand jury. The court held that admission of a videotape interview of appellant with a newsman was improper, but did not require reversal because it was not prejudicial and there was overwhelming evidence of his guilt. The court held that the grand jury's failure to comply strictly with Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 20.17 was not error because he was afforded the protections of the statute.

This accomplice witness testified against appellant in return for state not seeking the death penalty against him. Appellant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. The court affirmed appellant's conviction, holding that a conviction could not be had solely on the testimony of an accomplice witness unless it was corroborated. The court found that the evidence in the record corroborated the accomplice witness testimony and tended to incriminate appellant to the commission of the offense. The court held that the indictment contained all of the elements for capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(3). The court found that the extraneous offenses offered by state at the punishment stage of the trial did not require corroboration of accomplice witness testimony under Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 38.14. Therefore, the &quot;yes&quot; answers to the special issues under Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 37.071 were supported by relevant accomplice witnesses' testimony.

Accordingly, the court held that the statute did not violate the Due Process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Furthermore, because the language in the information was descriptive of the offer, the court found no error in the denial of appellant's motion to quash the information because it gave her insufficient notice of the charges against her.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought habeas corpus relief from an order of the Criminal District Court of Jefferson County (Texas), which rescinded appellant's bail pending appeal under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.04(c) based on a finding by the trial court that appellant was likely to commit another offense while on bail. The finding that appellant was likely to commit another offense was partially based on the voluntary testimony of appellant's wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being sentenced for burglary, appellant gave notice of appeal and bail was set pending appeal. Upon hearing voluntary testimony from appellant's wife, the trial court, under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.04(c), rescinded appellant's bail because it found appellant would likely commit another offense if released. Appellant sought habeas corpus relief, and the court affirmed. Appellant contended the trial court's order allowing bail had been improperly rescinded because conditions had not been set on the bail. The court rejected appellant's contention and held that although conditions had not been placed on bail, art. 44.04(c) had empowered the trial court to deny bail based on the likelihood that appellant would commit another offense. The court also held it was presumed that the trial court, acting without jury intervention, had disregarded the wife's testimony if inadmissible under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.11. Finally, the court held appellant had failed to preserve an issue regarding possible misidentification in the in-court identification process and concluded that the evidence had been sufficient to show appellant's identity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order rescinding appellant's bail pending appeal based on the likelihood appellant would commit another offense because the trial court had been empowered to rescind an order allowing unconditional bail pending appeal, the trial court, acting without a jury, had presumably disregarded the testimony of appellant's wife if inadmissible, and the in-court identification process had sufficiently identified appellant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellant's contention that the officer had no probable cause to arrest him for disorderly conduct was without merit because resisting arrest was a criminal offense even if the officer was making an unlawful arrest. Appellant's complaint as to excluded testimony was not preserved for review because he did not file a bill of exception. Lastly, the court held that Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were convicted of possession of an illegally taken deer and hunting in closed season, under a proclamation of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission (commission). Appellants challenged the convictions, contending that the commission exceeded its regulatory authority delegated by law under Tex. Parks &amp; Wild. Code Ann. &sect; 1.001 et seq. The court affirmed the convictions and held that the commission had authority to regulate the times during, and manners in which, it was lawful to take wildlife resources and to issue proclamations, pursuant to Tex. Parks &amp; Wild. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 61.021, 61.052. The court held that possession of the deer violated &sect; 61.021, which the commission merely reiterated by proclamation. The proclamation did not create double liability because the statutory scheme provided that a violation of a proclamation was punishable specifically under Tex. Parks &amp; Wild. Code Ann. &sect; 61.901. The proclamation at issue stated that there was no open season in the area appellants were hunting. The court held that the proclamation met the statutory requisites for determining whether there was an open season and was adopted pursuant to proper notice and hearing procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile was convicted for the murder of his 14 year old brother. Appellant was 16 years of age at the time of the offense. Appellant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence and the legality of searches and seizures, which resulted in evidence admitted at trial. The court affirmed the conviction and concluded that the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except for that of appellant's guilt. The court held that appellant did not make an admission of guilt and, therefore, appellee state was not required to disprove any exculpatory statement. The court concluded that the warrantless search and seizure of the murder scene was valid under the exigency rule, which was in effect at the time of the search. A subsequent Unite States Supreme Court ruling, which held that there was no murder scene exception to U.S. Const. amend. IV, was not retroactive and did not apply. Evidence was lawfully seized under the plain view doctrine and after appellant gave his consent to search. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 51.09(a) (Supp. 1980-1981), which provided for waiver of a juvenile's rights, did not apply and, thus, did not negate appellant's consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of conviction from a Dallas County (Texas) trial court, which entered a jury verdict convicting appellant of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. Appellant contended that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence the heroin which appellant claimed was unlawfully seized under U.S. Const. amend IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted by a jury of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. Appellant claimed that her conviction violated her rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV because the heroin seized from her was the fruit of an unlawful search, seizure, and arrest. The court reversed appellant's conviction, holding that the state violated her Fourth Amendment rights when it stopped and searched her without constitutionally adequate, reasonable grounds for doing so. The court held that appellant's heroin was the fruit of an unconstitutional search, seizure, and arrest. The court held that while a temporary investigative detention was allowed under certain circumstances, the circumstances must have been such as to distinguish the activity of the detained person from that of any other citizen and must have been based on an objective perception of events rather than the subjective feelings of the detaining officer. The court found that where the events were consistent with innocent activity as with criminal activity, a detention based on those events was unlawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's conviction of appellant for unlawful possession of a controlled substance and remanded the case to the trial court, holding that the state violated appellant's Fourth Amendment rights when it stopped and searched her without constitutionally adequate, reasonable grounds for doing so.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of the District Court of Travis County (Texas), which convicted her of the offense of possession of cocaine. Appellant contended that the cocaine was obtained as a result of an unlawful search of her purse made in violation of her rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV, and that therefore, her conviction should be reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following appellant's conviction for possession of cocaine, appellant challenged the decision. The court affirmed holding that because appellant's arrest was lawful, the search was proper. The police were not required to obtain a warrant because the search was restricted to a search of appellant's person and of the objects immediately associated with appellant's person. Further, the court held that the search of the purse was a search of items immediately associated with the person of appellant. Thus, although the arrest of appellant, standing alone, did not destroy whatever privacy interests she had in the contents of the purse, it did, at least for a reasonable time and to a reasonable extent, subordinate those interests to the legitimate governmental interest in discovering weapons and preventing the destruction or secretion of evidence. Therefore, the cocaine found in appellant's purse was admissible to support her conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for possession of cocaine holding that the search of appellant's purse was a search of items immediately associated with the person of appellant, and therefore was valid, even in the absence of a warrant, because it was incident to a lawful arrest. Therefore, appellant's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that he was deprived of due process and equal protection of law in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV in that the trial court denied him a transcript of a previous trial on the same charge of aggravated rape, which resulted in a mistrial. Appellant wanted the transcript for the purposes of discovery in preparation for the second trial, cross-examination, and possible impeachment. The court noted that if appellant was not indigent, he was not entitled to a transcript of the previous mistrial unless he had timely ordered the transcript and paid for it. The court found that twice appellant filed a motion for the transcript along with a pauper's oath but failed to secure a ruling from the trial court as to his indigency; he secured continuances stating he would acquire the money for the transcript. The court found that only on the third re-setting did appellant urge his indigency on the trial court and again asked for delay for the transcript to be prepared. The court affirmed and found that the request was not timely and to have granted it would only have served to delay the second trial a third time. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the motion.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that deferred adjudication permitted probation before conviction although the courts had not been authorized to grant such clemency and the legislature had no constitutional basis for authorizing it. The court held that the deferred adjudication authorized by statute was not probation within the meaning of Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11-A. The court considered whether another portion of the Texas Constitution would permit deferred adjudication. The court stated that Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 delegated the law-making authority to the legislature to define crimes and fix penalties, and held that deferred adjudication was a constitutional form of probation under the terms of Tex.

Appellant then sought the court's review asserting that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for the appointment of an expert to conduct a neurological examination. The court held that the appointment of an expert under Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 26.05 rested with the sound discretion of the trial court, and absent a showing of harm, no abuse of that discretion in the refusal to appoint an expert would be found. Here, appellant requested a psychologist and a neurologist to examine him for possible brain damage due to an automobile accident. Appellant did not however, present to the trial court the justification for requesting two separate experts, nor could it be concluded that the justification was so patently apparent that it did not have to be stated. Moreover, appellant specifically alleged that he was not claiming incompetency or insanity. Under such circumstances then, there was no harm suffered by appellant due to the trial court's refusal to appoint a neurologist. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal challenged the judgment from the trial court, Harris County, (Texas) that convicted him under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;31.04 for theft of services with a value over $ 200.00 but under $ 10,000, because there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction. Appellant also asserted that &sect;31.04 was violative of the federal constitution because it allowed selective prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal hired the victim painting contractor to paint a house and agreed that the victim would be paid every two weeks. After two weeks work and 128 hours of labor the victim requested payment and appellant gave the victim a check that was dishonored for insufficient funds. The trial court found appellant guilty of theft of services with a value over $ 200.00 but under $ 10,000 and appellant asserted that there was insufficient evidence to prove that appellant intended to avoid payment. The court held that appellant's intent to avoid payment was presumed under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;31.06(a) because the check was presented for payment within 30 days after issue, and appellant failed to pay the victim within 10 days after receiving the notice of dishonor from the bank for insufficient funds. The court also rejected appellant's contention that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;31.04, the theft of services statute, was unconstitutional because it allowed selective prosecution. The court held that appellant failed to meet his burden of proof, because appellant made no effort at trial to establish the alleged discriminatory prosecution, and nothing was presented for review on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment that found appellant criminal guilty of theft of services with a value over $ 200.00 but under $ 10,000. Appellant was denied relief because there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction and appellant failed to show that the theft of services statute allowed selective prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the District Court, Fort Worth (Texas), which convicted appellant on three separate indictments for three counts of burglary of a habitation. The evidence presented in all three offenses primarily consisted of videotapes that showed appellant selling the stolen property to an undercover police agent. Appellant contested the denial of his motion for a change of venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of three separate indictments for burglary of a habitation. The jury found that appellant had committed two previous offenses and punishment was set at life imprisonment for one conviction and 25 years for each of the other two offenses. Videotape obtained through a &quot;sting&quot; operation by undercover police agents showed appellant and others selling the stolen property to police &quot;fences.&quot; Appellant claimed that an accused was entitled to a change of venue as a matter of law when the state failed to contest the motion for a change of venue by controverting affidavits by &quot;a credible person.&quot; The state submitted two controverting affidavits, one of which was signed by the assistant district attorney. Appellant claimed that an assistant district attorney should not be considered &quot;a credible person,&quot; within the meaning of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 31.04. The court found that case law stated that the affidavit of a county attorney was sufficient to raise fact issues requiring the introduction of evidence, because Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 31.04 only required the affidavit of &quot;a&quot; credible person. An assistant district attorney was &quot;a&quot; credible person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting appellant for three counts of burglary of a habitation was affirmed, because the trial court did not err in overruling appellant's motion for a change of venue. The contested affidavit of the county attorney was sufficient to raise fact issues requiring the introduction of evidence. The statute only required that the affidavit of a credible person and the assistant district attorney was a credible person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While protesting the use of non-union workers violence broke out and a trailer was set on fire. Two appellants were convicted of riot by arson, and another appellant was convicted of riot by criminal mischief under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.02. The court granted appellee state's motion for a rehearing and affirmed appellants' conviction for riot by arson holding that the evidence was sufficient to show that the rioters attempted to overturn the trailer, it was doused with gasoline, and set on fire; therefore, a charge on circumstantial evidence was not required. The court held that &sect; 42.02 was constitutional and that participation in a lawful assembly was permissible, but once someone manifested an intent to engage in unlawful conduct the party had a duty to disengage from the assembly. The court denied appellee's motion as to appellant whose conviction was reversed for riot by criminal mischief holding that the jury charge in his case was defective because the charge did not require the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly participated in the riot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of theft of property over the value of $ 200.00 and less than $ 10,000.00. Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction and that the indictment failed to prove ownership as alleged in the indictment. The evidence at trial showed that defendant was arrested in store and that he had in his possession eight sweaters that belonged to store. The court determined that the security guard had a greater right of ownership of the sweaters than defendant who was proved to be a thief. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision by the trial court (Texas) to revoke his probation after it found that he had committed aggravated perjury in violation of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.04(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of delivery of marihuana, and his probation was revoked for allegedly committing an offense against the law. Appellant contended that the statute defining aggravated perjury, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.04(a) was unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed and held that the definition of material in the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The court also rejected appellant's contention that his testimony was not material. The testimony could have effected the credibility of state's witness, so it was material. It was not error for the trial court to deny appellant's motion to quash the state's motion to revoke probation because the motion did give him full and fair notice of that which he would be called to defend. Finally, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to infer the requisite intent to commit perjury from the circumstances. As a result of the above findings, the court affirmed the revocation of probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision to revoke appellant's probation because the aggravated perjury statute was not unconstitutional, appellant's testimony was material, appellant had adequate notice of the allegations against him, and the trial court was permitted to infer the intent to commit perjury.</SPAN></P>
