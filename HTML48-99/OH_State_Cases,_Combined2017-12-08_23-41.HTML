</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which entered a jury verdict convicting him of aggravated murder, with two specifications, and three counts of aggravated robbery and which sentenced him to death on the aggravated murder count and to consecutive terms of 7-25 years imprisonment on the aggravated robbery counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had fatally stabbed a store clerk during a robbery and had participated in other robberies. He contended that Ohio's framework for imposition of capital punishment was unconstitutional and that the death sentence was unconstitutionally imposed on him because the offense and capital specifications were allied offenses or specifications of similar import. The court noted that the Ohio Supreme Court had upheld Ohio's scheme for the imposition of the death penalty. It found that defendant had had a separate animus as to the victims, the clerk and the store. Thus, the jury's consideration of the specifications was proper. The court found that five jurors excused for cause, based on their opposition to capital punishment, were properly excluded. The court held that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.05(A), the evidence supported the jury's finding that defendant was guilty of the aggravating circumstances (murder while committing aggravated robbery), and that the trial court properly weighed the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating factors. It found the death sentence appropriate, as it was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developers wanted to build a fast-food restaurant. The city's development guidelines for the district, which was classified as an urban design-business environmental quality district, contained a provision stating that new businesses should contribute to the desired mix of commercial activities and that franchise type establishments were acceptable if they were primarily pedestrian and not automobile oriented. The city council determined that the proposed use of the property as a fast-food restaurant was not permitted under the zoning code because it failed to contribute to the desired mix of commercial activity in the district. The court reversed, finding that the challenged section of the development guidelines did not contain any objective criteria for the attainment of stated goals and permitted the exercise of unbridled discretion. Accordingly, the denial of the permit was unconstitutional and arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of the permit and entered judgment in favor of the developers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by a police officer because the rear wheel of his vehicle was wobbling. Upon approaching defendant's car, the arresting officer saw a rifle slung over the back of the driver's seat, secured in a homemade rack or holder made for that purpose. It was clear that the rifle was readily visible to someone standing along side the vehicle. Defendant was convicted for violation of Westerville, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 523.05(c) which provided that no person shall knowingly transport or have a firearm in a motor vehicle, unless it was unloaded, and was carried in one of the following ways: in plain sight and secured in a rack or holder made for the purpose. Defendant appealed his conviction and the court on appeal reversed. The trial court construed plain sight to mean that the weapon had to be visible from a distance to other drivers on the highway. Criminal statutes were to be strictly construed in favor of defendant. Hence, plain sight meant clearly visible to someone looking into the interior of the vehicle. It was improper to extend the meaning of plain sight to require that the firearm had to be visible some distance away to a person riding in another motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for violation of the city ordinance in regard to transportation of firearms was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court with instructions to enter final judgment for defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners challenged a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Warren County, Ohio, which found that appellee county commissioners were entitled to construct a pipe line within a highway easement without the necessity of appropriating property nor compensating the landowners and therefore dismissed the landowners' action for such compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners filed a complaint alleging that they were the owners in fee simple, subject to an easement for highway purposes, of real property known as Kings Mills Road. The complaint further alleged that the commissioners planned to install a sanitary sewer system under the roadway area, and, despite the landowners' request, the commissioners had neither acted to appropriate nor attempted to negotiate an easement for the placement of the pipeline. The trial court dismissed the complaint insofar as the landowners' sought compensation from the commissioners. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 6117.47, the commissioners had the right to occupy any public road, street, avenue, or alley for the proper construction and maintenance of a trunk or main sewer. Despite the landowners' contention, &sect; 6117.47 was constitutional because the commissioners' construction of water pipes in real property, for which an easement for highway purposes had been given, was not an added burden on the property, for which the landowners were entitled to compensation. Thus, as &sect; 6117.47 did not authorize the taking of property without payment of just compensation, Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 19 was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners challenged a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which denied the property owners' motion for further relief. Defendant village changed the zoning on the property owners' lots and the trial court invalidated the rezoning holding that it was unconstitutional. The village then reenacted the same zoning ordinance through a referendum process and dismissed its appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adopted ordinance changed the zoning from mixed zoning to single-family residential. Reversing, the court ruled that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.09 placed the burden on the village to demonstrate why its action should have been permissible. The court found that the village produced no evidence of a change in circumstances, nor did the village claim that further hearings were held which allowed the council members or planning board to hear new evidence. The court ruled that the trial court had continuing jurisdiction over the controversy so as to prevent municipalities from frustrating the trial court's function by enacting inconsequential changes and forcing the affected parties to relitigate the same issues. The court held that the final judgment of the trial court struck down the existing zoning and reinstated the prior permissible use. The court held that the action required the trial court to strike down rezoning of this area barring a showing by the village that the new zoning did not suffer the same infirmities. The court ruled that the trial court erred by not enforcing its prior judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant parked seven motor vehicles on his residential driveway and was convicted under &sect; 1165.04. On appeal, the court first vacated the prison sentence imposed by the municipal court, finding that the record did not contain a colloquy showing defendant's knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The court then affirmed the remainder of the judgment, ruling that the prosecutor's failure to introduce the plat into evidence to establish defendant's ownership of the land was not reversible error. Defendant made remarks during closing argument showing ownership. The court also found that &sect; 1165.04 was not unconstitutional. It bore a substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare, in that barring the storage of vehicles in front yards protected the aesthetics of the community and protected desirable characteristics of existing residential development. Further, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague in its reference to &quot;front yard.&quot; That term was expressly and clearly defined in the ordinance and the incorporated definition, Village of Oakwood, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 1135.21, encompassed driveways.</SPAN></P>

The court found that in requesting leave to file his answer instanter, the dentist informed the court clerical errors prevented the complaint from having been transmitted to counsel. The court held that such an error constituted excusable neglect. Further, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(A) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The court ruled that merely treating two separate groups differently did not necessarily violate the Equal Protection Clause. Only discrimination among groups who were &quot;similarly situated&quot; posed an equal protection problem. The court found that people with dental claims were not &quot;similarly situated&quot; with people commencing medical claims.

After she was charged and confined for theft and fraud, the Board took temporary custody of her sons on two occasions. The Board filed a reunification plan with the court, and the sons were returned to the mother. After the mother was imprisoned, the sons were placed in foster care. The Board then sought permanent custody of the sons, and the trial court granted the request, terminating the mother's parental rights. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly found that the Board acted in good faith in attempting to reunify the mother with her sons because the mother did not do those things necessary to accomplish the objectives in the reunification plan. The court also held that when it was clear that a parent was and would continue to be unsuitable, that to go back to the parent would be detrimental to the children, and that permanent commitment of the children to the custody of another was in their best interests, then permanent custody should be granted.</SPAN></P>

The Department sought reimbursement for payments for medical services rendered to the Medicaid recipient. The hospital filed a motion for summary judgment against the Department, which the trial court granted. The court affirmed the trial court's decision and held that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2305.27 represented a rational response by the general assembly to a compelling state interest in the malpractice crisis and was constitutional. Under &sect; 2305.27, the court viewed the Department as an indemnitor, being one who provided compensation for incurred medical services or medical support to eligible recipients. The court also found &sect; 2305.27 created an implied contract for such compensation between the Department and the Medicaid recipient. The court held that &sect; 2305.27 was a special provision that irreconcilably conflicted with Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 5101.58, which was a general provision.</SPAN></P>

The other shareholders appealed the trial court's use of a statutory formula to determine the value of their shares, and the court reversed and remanded. The trust filed a separate appeal, and argued that it was error to refuse to appoint an appraiser and to deny the trust discovery and a continuance. The corporation filed a cross-appeal. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1701.85 permitted, but dd not require, the trial court to appoint an appraiser.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 2907.06 and claimed that sustaining the prosecutor's objections to his questions to the victim violated his due process rights. On appeal, the court reversed because the trial court erred in not permitting defendant to develop the possible defense of consent at trial. The prosecutor's argument that defendant had to present his &quot;plea&quot; that the victim consented by written motion was wholly misplaced. The rules of criminal procedure did not require defendant's consent defense to be pleaded or raised by motion before trial. But the court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 2907.06 was void for vagueness because it limited unlawful contact to that which the offender knew was effectively offensive to a given person. The court concluded that the &sect; 2907.06 standard was actually an objective, rather than a subjective standard as defendant contended. Section 2907.06 provided adequate notice with respect to due process standards because it provided a standard of proscription that clearly spelled out the unlawful conduct.</SPAN></P>

They argued that it had been error to find Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5313.07, 5313.08 inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The land contract had provided that on the failure to make required payments, the unpaid balance would become due and that as a remedy the contract might be terminated and all payments retained as liquidated damages for nonperformance while the sellers retook possession of the premises without legal process or notice. On review, the administratrix and widow argued that it had been error to hold &sect;&sect; 5313.07, 5313.08 substantive and inapplicable to the land installment contract because it had been entered into before the enactment of the statutes. They also argued that it had been error to find a forfeiture where the sellers had accepted substantial payment after their notice of termination. The court found that: (1) the statutes had been enacted in response to historical injustices caused by the remedy of forfeiture in land installment contracts; (2) the statutes clearly delineated the available remedies and procedures in order to restrict the availability of forfeiture to prevent an unjust windfall to sellers; and (3) because the statutes were remedial rather than substantive in nature, they clearly applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder while committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01(B). The trial court sentenced him to life imprisonment, and defendant sought review contending that the challenge for cause process in a capital case denied him the right to a fair and impartial jury. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.25(C), a potential juror in a capital case could have been challenged for cause when the juror unequivocally stated that under no circumstances would he follow the instructions of a trial judge and consider fairly the imposition of a sentence of death. The court found that parties were given wide latitude in voir dire questioning in such regard. However, the court determined that the right to a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community did not include the right to be tried by jurors who were unwilling to follow the law and instructions of the judge. The court held that, to death-qualify a jury prior to the guilt phase had not denied defendant a trial by an impartial jury. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions and found that defendants did not make any attempt to comply with the compulsory school attendance laws. According to the common pleas court's findings of fact, defendants admitted that they made no contact with authorities regarding their child's non-attendance at school, and they admitted that they had decided months before their child was due to be enrolled in first grade not to apply for an exemption from attendance. The court rejected their contention that the compulsory school attendance law was unconstitutional because they did not prove at trial that the law infringed upon any of their religious liberties or personal liberties. They totally ignored the application of the law and an available procedure whereby they legally could have done what they wanted to do. If they had applied to the superintendent of schools, a proper investigation would have afforded them the chance to prove that their daughter was entitled to excused absences. If the superintendent's decision did not meet with their satisfaction, they could have pursued a proper appeal in a juvenile court.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, she claimed that the trial court's jury charge on the meaning of keeping and harboring was overly broad, and the court agreed. The court held that the jury was charged not with respect to harboring but with respect to keeping, that one keeps an animal where he exercises control over an animal on his premises with knowledge of its being there. The court further held that the trial court committed prejudicial and reversible error by allowing the prosecution to call defendant's son as a witness, whom the prosecutor knew would invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court based its decision that the owner had not violated a zoning ordinance by selling beer at his establishment on its belief that the zoning ordinance at issue was in direct conflict with state law permitting the gas station owner to sell beer at his establishment, and the ordinance was therefore unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court reasoned that it had previously rejected the proposition that state liquor laws always pre-empted township zoning regulations restricting the sale of intoxicating beverages. The court held that the state legislature recognized that there would be conflicts between zoning and the issuance of liquor permits and that liquor permits would sometimes be subordinate to zoning regulations. As such, the court held that because the trial court below decided the case solely on the basis of the pre-emption doctrine, the case had to be remanded for consideration of the gas station owner's other defenses to enforcement of the ordinance, which included estoppel, waiver, and the constitutionality of the ordinance itself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with child endangering after a fire in an apartment while she was babysitting. There was evidence that the children's mother had asked her to care for the children while she was gone but defendant denied that request was made. When the mother returned, she found that a fire had destroyed two pieces of furniture. It was later determined that the fire was caused by one of the children playing with matches. Defendant was found guilty in a bench trial. She argued that the trial court erred in finding that: (1) she was a guardian, custodian, in control, or in loco parentis, of the children; (2) she had a duty of care toward them; and (3) her actions created a substantial risk to their safety. The court reviewed the record, weighed the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considered the credibility of the witnesses, and determined that in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trial court had not lost its way or created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed. It could have properly concluded that leaving a five- and seven-year-old alone with access to matches created a substantial risk to their safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinances &sect; 365.01 required the property owners, who operated multiple-family dwellings within the city, to obtain occupancy permits before renting the units for residential purposes. Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinances &sect; 365.05 prescribed the fees that the property owners had to pay. The cost was $ 15 per suite each year, subject to a maximum fee of $ 600 for any one structure. The property owners argued that this scheme was arbitrary and capricious and discriminatory in that it required payments for fees in an unequal manner because a 40-unit building would be liable to pay as much in fees as that paid by a 1000-unit building. Affirming, the court noted that the city officials provided evidentiary material to demonstrate that the costs for the administrative program exceeded the fees charged to support it. The property owners failed to rebut the evidence with contrary evidentiary materials. The court held that the licensing fees satisfied the requirement that they be reasonably related to the administrative costs incurred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction of aggravated murder and gross abuse of corpse. The court held: (1) that sufficient evidence showed the State did not fail to properly preserve blood evidence; (2) that defendant failed to show that the State's policy of not photographing its electrophoretic results was to purposely suppress exculpatory evidence; (3) that the trial court's delay in appointing a defense expert was not constitutionally or statutorily defective because the trial court was awaiting the receipt of information from defense counsel in the trial court's consideration of making the appointment; (4) that defendant's arrest was legal because it was based upon reasonable cause to believe that he committed the offenses; (5) that the trial court did not err in failing to suppress the evidence seized from the dwelling defendant shared with another person because the State had shown that the search was based on lawful consent of the other person, who had access to all rooms used by defendant; and (6) that the trial court did not err in failing to dismiss the death penalty specification.

Defendant argued that he was denied his right to a speedy trial pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71. The prosecution argued that defendant was not being held in jail solely on the indictments in the present case, and that he was therefore not entitled to the triple-count provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71(D). The court observed that the State failed to present any evidence of any other indictments that defendant was being held for. Thus, the court was constrained to hold that defendant, not having been brought to trial within the statutory period, had presented a prima facie case for discharge. The court concluded that the State failed to meet its burden of proving that defendant was not entitled to the triple-count provision of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an earlier appeal, the court reversed an order of the trial court (Ohio), which had declared certain ordinances unconstitutional as applied and granted injunctive relief to appellees, business operator and others. Upon remand, the trial court granted a permanent injunction against appellant village, enjoining it from enforcing the ordinances against the business operator. The village appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business operator had an auto recycling and wrecking company. Following a new zoning code, the wrecking company became a nonconforming use. Because the nonconforming use exited prior to the zoning code, the company was permitted to continue to do business. A problem arose when the business operator had a concrete structure erected on the property for storage. After being cited for zoning violations, the business owner sued. The trial court found that the ordinances were unconstitutional as applied and enjoined the village from causing the destruction of the structure. On appeal, the court held that the business operator had waived his right to a declaratory judgment by failing to pursue administrative remedies and that the trial court erred in holding the village ordinances unconstitutional as applied. On remand, the trial court again granted permanent injunctive relief, holding that the ordinances had been misapplied. On appeal, the court modified the trial court's order granting injunctive relief, but otherwise affirmed. According to the court, the &quot;law of the case&quot; doctrine did not prevent the trial court's action, but the trial court's order was too broad as written.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's injunction to provide that the village was permanently enjoined from enforcing any alleged violations of its zoning ordinances arising from the business operator's construction of the structure at issue in the instant case. As modified, the court affirmed the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The man argued that the failure of the trial court to furnish him as an indigent with a transcript of proceedings and the clerk to issue subpoenas without requiring a witness fees deposit violated his due process and equal protection rights. The court found that there was no fundamental interest that was gained or lost depending on the availability of the relief sought by the man. It also rejected his contention that the filing fee, as it applied to indigents, violated the equal protection clause by unconstitutionally discriminating against the poor because there was a reasonable justification for the fee, which was, that the court system incurred operating costs and the fee produced some revenue to help in offsetting them. In addition when a transcript was unavailable, Ohio R. App. P. 9(C) and (D) provided that an agreed statement could be used as the record on appeal. Finally, Ohio R. Civ. P. 45(C) provided that any person designated by a trial court, who was not less than 18 and who was not a party, could serve a subpoena. Accordingly, the man could not establish a clear legal duty upon the judge and clerk to furnish him with either a transcript or subpoenas free of cost.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the trial court's decision dismissing charges filed against the two defendants, the court stated that the legislature's power to control the manufacture, distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages was practically unlimited. Control of its liquor industry by the State was not subject to the constitutional sanctions and limitations ordinarily attendant to an exercise of its general police power by a state. The court stated that the State certainly had the power to legislate that no one could possess beer within the territorial boundaries of the State of Ohio unless such beer had been purchased from a person who had first been investigated by the State and subsequently licensed by the State. The court stated that in enacting a statute, it was presumed that compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United States was intended by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer solicited business by direct mail solicitation materials. The taxpayer's solicitation materials were not utilized in the making of retail sales as defined in Ohio Rev.

The matter came before the tax board of review and the board decided that the amended returns were not timely filed. The board decided that the city tax department properly concluded that income from the company's finance charges was not interest but other income and not subject to exclusion under Parma, Ohio, Ordinance No. 183.29(h). The company appealed and the trial court reversed the board's decision. The city tax department appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court because it found that the trial court substituted its judgment for that of the board. Further, the court found that the trial court did not review the board's decision in compliance with Ohio Rev.

The court affirmed and held that defendant was properly convicted of the aggravated burglary because the consent defendant may have had when he entered the victim's home was revoked by the victim once defendant's conduct became suspicious, which transformed the entry into a trespass. The court independently found that the aggravating circumstance that defendant was found guilty of outweighed the mitigating factors in the case beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the trial court had not erred in its weighing of the mitigating and aggravating factors as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929, and that its written opinion had adequately addressed each required factor. The court found that the death sentence was appropriate, in light of similar cases that were within the universe of cases the court considered, and that the imposition of the death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Municipal Court of Chillicothe, Ohio, dismissed a complaint against one defendant, who was charged with violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11(A)(2), and a complaint against another defendant, who was charged with violating Chillicothe, Ohio, Rev. Ordinance &sect; 509.03(a)(2), on the grounds that said statute and ordinance were unconstitutional. The State and the City appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the charges against defendants, holding that the laws under which they were charged were unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the State and the City averred that the trial court erred by declaring Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11 (A)(2)&nbsp;unconstitutional. Upon consideration, the court affirmed the court's dismissal of the charges against one defendant but reversed as to the other defendant. Because the first defendant was only charged with violating &sect; 2917.11(A)(2) as it related to &quot;making unreasonable noise&quot; and such language failed to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct would violate the statute and encouraged ad hoc and discriminatory enforcement, the judgment of the trial court dismissing the complaint as unconstitutionally vague was affirmed. As to the second defendant, who was charged with &quot;unwarranted and grossly abusive language,&quot; the court could not determine whether that defendant's words constituted language akin to &quot;fighting words&quot; not constitutionally protected. Accordingly, the trial court's order in that case was reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to the first defendant, who was charged with &quot;making unreasonable noise,&quot; the court affirmed the trial court's order dismissing the charge against him. As to the other defendant, who was charged with &quot;unwarranted and grossly abusive language,&quot; the court revered and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the commitment hearing correctly showed that defendant was a mentally ill person subject to hospitalization as defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5122.01.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant schoolteacher sought review of a judgment of the Fulton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted appellee board of education's motion to dismiss as to the schoolteacher's due process claim and granted the board's motion for summary judgment on the schoolteacher's breach of contract claim in the schoolteacher's action arising from the termination of her employment with the board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The schoolteacher worked for three years under one-year contracts. When her last one-year contract expired, the board failed to renew the contract and provided no reasons for non-renewal. The schoolteacher contended that the dismissal was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in that she was not accorded an evaluation as provided for in her contract. The schoolteacher further claimed that the board breached the contract by not providing her an evaluation. On appeal, the court held that the schoolteacher had a property interest in continued employment. The requisite &quot;good faith&quot; of the board was conspicuously absent at the time it exercised official action to discharge the schoolteacher. The schoolteacher was due all process incident to the evaluation procedure. Further, the schoolteacher was entitled to a hearing prior to the taking of official action summarily discharging her. It was incumbent upon the board to provide her with a pretermination hearing that incorporated basic due process features of notice and an opportunity to respond. The court further held that the board breached its contract by failing to utilize the evaluation procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant submitted an application to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA), seeking a permit to locate a hazardous waste storage and treatment facility along the Ohio River. The application was reviewed for compliance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3734.12(D) and was then transmitted to the Board for review. The Board conducted both a public hearing and an adjudication hearing. The Board denied the State of West Virginia's motion to intervene filed one day before the scheduled hearing, although it participated as a &quot;guest.&quot; After submission of the hearing examiner's report and recommendations, the Board granted the application subject to conditions to be enforced by the Ohio EPA. The court affirmed, holding inter alia that the applicant was not required to produce evidence of alternative technologies and sites to show that the proposed facility would have the least adverse environmental impact. The Board did not err by adopting the second recommendation to grant the permit subject to conditions rather than delaying its issuance. Because the State of West Virginia did not move to intervene more than 30 days before the hearing, it had no statutory right to intervene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners, who already had a 120-foot radio tower on their residential property, wanted permission to erect an additional, lower tower in the back of their one-acre lot so that they could better enjoy being amateur radio operators. The city contended that under the applicable ordinance, the property owners could build such a tower provided that it was attached to their home. The landowners maintained that the ordinance resulted in unconstitutional disparate treatment because there was no rational basis between a tower attached to a house and one that was not given that freestanding towers affected the community in the same manner as did towers attached to residences. The court agreed with the property owners and reversed on this ground because the city was unable to premise the ordinance on any traditional police power customarily exercised by a municipality. Additionally, the court determined pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.04 that the trial court did not err in finding, as a matter of fact, that the property owners sustained only an &quot;inconvenience&quot; by being denied the variance, not the &quot;hardship&quot; necessary to trigger the grant of a variance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was struck from behind by a car that was operated by the driver as she walked alongside a road on her way home one fall evening. The decedent suffered severe head injuries and died in the hospital approximately two days later without regaining consciousness. The administrator of decedent's estate was awarded damages on a wrongful death claim against the driver. No punitive damage award was made. The dispositive issue was whether the administrator was just as eligible for the proceeds from a punitive damage award as the decedent herself. The court held that the administrator was not entitled to punitive damages. The administrator sought to take advantage of an opportunity in which he had no personal stake whatsoever. Moreover, the imposition of punitive damages was for the public good, and not for the compensation or gratification of wronged family members. The court concluded that the disallowance of punitive damage claims in wrongful death actions did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, as the administrator had contended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Hamilton County (Ohio) declaring that the portion of the sexual battery statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.03(A)(5), that prohibited sexual conduct in a relationship where one party stood &quot;in loco parentis&quot; with respect to the other was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court had struck from the indictment the allegation that defendant stood in place of a parent to the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that it did not have jurisdiction to review the question posed to it by the State, therefore the court dismissed the appeal without any discussion of the merits of the State's assignment of error. The court held that because the effect of the trial court's ruling did not dismiss the charge contained in the indictment, but only deleted certain language in a way that did not otherwise facially vitiate the charge in law, there was no final order from which the State could take an appeal as a matter of right under Ohio Rev.

Defendant was also ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's appellate counsel asserted that the trial court violated Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(C)(2) by accepting and sentencing on the plea because defendant did not understand the effect of the plea in that he was misinformed of his chances for parole, and he believed that his sentence would be other than the one imposed. The court ruled that the trial court adhered to the dictates of Rule 11(C) and fully informed defendant of the consequences of his plea. In rejecting the claims raised by defendant pro se, the court ruled that: (1) defendant's claim that he did not have the requisite intent to commit the offense because at the time he was not sane could not be decided because the issue was not exemplified by the record before the court under Ohio R. App. P. 12(A); (2) because he did not plead not guilty by reason of insanity, the claim that he was not advised of the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.39 right to choose a psychiatrist was meritless; and (3) defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, based upon alleged discovery deficiencies, was meritless because there was no indication of any evidence favorable to him that counsel did not attempt to discover.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment. Defendant, a babysitter, was found guilty of the crime of endangering children after a child that had been her care sustained a broken wrist and skull fractures. The complaint alleged the breach of a duty of care or creation of a harm to the child while having custody of the child. Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2919.22 (A) provided that no person having custody of a child should create a substantial risk to the safety of the child, by violating a duty of care, protection, or support. The alleged crime was charged first in the words of the statute and then in the words, did &quot;permit or create a harm to her including but not limited to&quot; specified injuries. The court held that the combined allegations met the standards set forth in Sammons and constituted sufficient averment of all material facts constituting the essential elements of the offense so that defendant had adequate notice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to allocate the burden of proof to prove the mitigating factors needed to reduce murder to voluntary manslaughter, that there was no evidence of sudden passion or fit of rage to support the voluntary manslaughter conviction, and that the firearm specification in the murder indictment could not be applied to his conviction on the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter. The court found that the trial court's jury charge on voluntary manslaughter was entirely proper and inured to defendant's benefit. The mitigating factors of sudden passion or fit of rage were not affirmative defenses which required an allocation of burden of proof. They served only to lessen the culpability of a crime. There was ample evidence of sudden passion or fit of rage. It was uncontroverted that defendant and the victim had quarreled and that the victim had threatened defendant. The firearm specification applied to the voluntary manslaughter conviction because the murder indictment was sufficient to give defendant notice of all lesser included offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

On appeal, the mother challenged the admission of a letter written by the children's foster parent to the Board, which alleged acts of prostitution by the mother. The letter related to a conversation between one of the children and his foster brother. Thus, the letter was hearsay within hearsay. The letter was admitted at the dispositional hearing held to determine the best interest of the children. The court affirmed the termination and held that, under Ohio R. Juv. P. 34(B)(2), any evidence that was material and relevant was admissible. The letter was admitted for the limited purpose of establishing that the child made the statement, not to prove that the mother was a prostitute. The trial court found that the mother failed to comply with the reunification plan, that she had a history of mental illness that was unlikely to improve, and that the children had been psychologically abused and had shown improvement after being removed from the mother's care. Thus, the termination of parental rights was supported by clear and convincing evidence and was in accordance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.414.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the South Euclid Municipal Court (Ohio), which convicted him of speeding. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and convicted of speeding. In addition to a fine, the trial court suspended defendant's driver's license and impounded his certificate of registration and registration plates for non-compliance with proof of financial responsibility as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101. Defendant asserted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101 violated the separation of powers tenet of the Ohio Constitution. The court agreed and found that the statute violated Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 1, in that: (1) it permitted the Registrar of Motor Vehicles to exercise appellate jurisdiction over judicial decisions; (2) the statute served to make courts the de facto agents of an administrative board, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, and thus imposed non-judicial duties upon judges. As drafted, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101 expressly violated the separation of powers doctrine of Ohio Constitution in two ways. Specifically, &sect; 4509.101 violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, not only by providing the Registrar of Motor Vehicles with a form of appellate jurisdiction over trial courts, but by making those courts the de facto agents of the Registrar.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the judgment, the trial court held, inter alia, that the police had probable cause to arrest defendant where an eyewitness provided a reliable basis for a broadcast that included a detailed description of the offense, the offenders, and their car. The court concluded that intoxication was an affirmative defense, which defendant had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence, and ruled that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.11(B)(1)(b), a penalty enhancing statute, did not unconstitutionally punish defendant for conduct that predated the statute; rather, it increased his punishment for a later crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) sought review of a judgment from the Miami County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which denied the VFW's request for a permanent injunction preventing appellee board of elections from placing a referendum on the election ballot. In seeking review, the VFW claimed that the referendum petitions were not legally sufficient pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 731.31, 3501.38(C).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council approved the VFW's rezoning request by adopting an ordinance that covered the area to be rezoned. Thereafter, referendum petitions directed at the ordinance were filed with the board, preventing the ordinance from becoming effective until an election was held. Consequently, the VFW filed an action, requesting a permanent injunction to prevent the board from placing the referendum on the ballot. In requesting the injunction, the VFW claimed that the referendum petitions were legally insufficient under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 731.31, 3501.38(C). Following an unfavorable judgment, the VFW sought review. Upon review, the court held that a petition signer was not required to provide one's ward and precinct under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3501.38(C). The court also held that by giving only their streets and numbers, the signers were in compliance with &sect; 3501.38(C)'s requirement that they provide the locations of their voting residence. Finally, the court held that because the petitions contained the ordinance number and a full and correct copy of its title as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 731.31, the signers were adequately informed about the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant complained that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress physical evidence, restricting his counsel's questions to prospective jurors, ruling on evidentiary issues, permitting unfair jury arguments, rejecting his motion for an acquittal, enforcing the vague statute that defined the offense, instructing the jury improperly, and sentencing him excessively. The court rejected defendant's contentions. The police had specific articulable grounds, which reasonably warranted their suspicion that defendant was committing an offense. Defendant had failed to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion by discouraging apparently repetitive inquiries about prior jury service. The trial court properly instructed the jury that theft could result from deception because the statute so provided and the evidence permitted that finding. An officer's testimony supported a finding that defendant knew or had reason to know that he possessed or disposed of stolen property. The denial of defendant's motion for an acquittal was proper. The trial court did not err by imposing an indefinite sentence within the limits prescribed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.11(B)(7).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with theft and possession of criminal tools in connection with the theft of a wall clock from a department store. Defendant signed a waiver of his speedy trial rights and was later tried. Defendant was convicted of theft and his conviction was classified as grand theft because he had previously been convicted of a theft offense. Defendant appealed, arguing that &sect; 2913.02 was an unconstitutional ex post facto law in that it retrospectively changed the legal consequences of his prior act. The court rejected that argument, noting that the provisions of &sect; 2913.02(B) at the time of the first conviction were the same as the provisions in effect at the time of defendant's trial. The court concluded that defendant had not been subject to any retroactive legislation. Defendant also argued on appeal that he had been denied his right to a speedy trial. The court noted that defendant had not raised that issue in the trial court and held that it would not consider an error that defendant failed to present to the trial court so as to provide the trial court an opportunity to correct the alleged error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was to sell his vehicle to a woman for $ 150. Defendant gave her only a duplicate title that he had not signed over to her. Defendant ultimately used his own keys to take the vehicle from her possession. The trial court convicted defendant of failure to deliver a certificate of title. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court committed harmless error when it admitted evidence of defendant's prior theft convictions. The court found that even in the absence of the prior conviction evidence, it was clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a guilty verdict. The court determined that there was ample evidence to support defendant's conviction. The court concluded that the trial court did not commit reversible error when it refused to grant defendant's motion for acquittal because the evidence was not so slight that reasonable minds must have had reasonable doubts as to defendant's guilt. The court found that the trial court did not err when it failed to sentence defendant to the lesser period of incarceration as provided in Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver argued that the suspension order could not operate against him if he had either entered a plea of guilty or no contest, and that, accordingly, he was being punished for exercising his right to stand trial. The driver further argued that it was impossible to discriminate between those who pleaded and those exercised their right to stand trial and were convicted. The court affirmed and found the classification constitutional. There was no question that the statute discriminated between classes, but not all discrimination was impermissible. The court held that the classification was reasonably related to a proper public purpose, that was, the removal of drunk drivers from the highways. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191 involved no suspect classification. Drunk drivers were not suspect classifications such as race, religion, or nationality, nor was a fundamental right involved.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer spotted defendant's car weaving down a road in county 1. The officer stopped defendant after following him into county 2. The officer arrested defendant after he failed several field sobriety test results. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss based upon lack of proper venue. The court affirmed the conviction and held that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.12(A), defendant could have been tried in either county. Because the police officer explained that .10 was the level at which a person may not legally operate a motor vehicle, there was ample testimony in the State's case to allow the jury to infer defendant's .17 intoxilyzer result meant defendant was intoxicated. Also, defendant waived any error concerning any failure of the trial court to rule on all four of the motions to suppress by failing to file a motion for clarification of the judgment entry and by failing to raise a question at trial concerning the status of the motions to suppress. Further, the police officer had probable cause to stop defendant and had reasonable grounds to believe that defendant had been driving while under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

A board of tax appeals found that the assessment of sales and use tax was properly issued against the company's purchase of tubing. The board of tax appeals found that the tubing was annexed to the land, that it was put to its intended use as drainage tubing, and that the company intended that the personalty be permanently annexed to the realty. On appeal, the court found that the drainage tubing should have been considered an improvement to the land and that the company was a construction contractor who incorporated the improvements. The company was a consumer of tubing and responsible for the sales tax for the purchase of the tubing. The court affirmed the board of tax appeals' finding that the company was a construction contractor as that term was used in Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder. New counsel was appointed for defendant's appeal and his trial counsel was allowed to withdraw. On appeal, the court found that aggravated murder was by statutory provision a capital offense and that defendant was entitled to a special venire as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.18 and to more than four peremptory challenges as provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.21 and Ohio R. Crim. P. 24(C). However, because the amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.02 was procedural and not substantive, the trial court did not err to defendant's prejudice by not permitting the exercise of peremptory challenges and the selection of a special venire. The court held that there was no basis on the record upon which it could find a substantial violation of an essential duty owed to defendant by his trial counsel that would have prejudiced the defense. The record did not demonstrate any denial of a fair trial or due process of law owed defendant. The court concluded that there was substantial evidence presented upon which a jury could have reasonably concluded that all the elements of aggravated murder had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers arrived at defendants' home after receiving a report about a disturbance. Upon arrival, one of defendants was playing a guitar with the amplifier set very high. He refused to turn down the amplifier after being asked, then the police officers asked the other defendant if they could come in and discuss the situation. She refused, but they pried open the door and entered the premises. Defendants were subsequently found guilty of resisting arrest and assault. On appeal, the court found that the officers should have obtained a warrant before entering defendants' premises as when the offense occurred courts were open and a warrant could have been obtained in a reasonably short time. However, the court determined that the violence against the officers after they had gained entrance into the residence, albeit unlawfully, with a purpose to cause physical injury rather than to resist entry was not a privileged conduct. The court found that because the crime of petty theft was a crime of dishonesty, one of defendant's conviction was properly introduced under Ohio R. Evid. 609(A) and affirmed the convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision from the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which sentenced defendant to the maximum term of imprisonment. Defendant was indicated for grand theft in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02. Included was an allegation that defendant had previously been convicted of a theft offense, making the offense a felony. Defendant pled guilty to the third degree felony and specification of a prior assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed on the grounds that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.11(D) was unconstitutional to the extent that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.01(I)(1) included assault, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.13(B), as an offense of violence. The court found defendant's assignment of error without merit and affirmed the judgment and sentence of the trial court. Defendant argued that the court must interpret the prior conviction for assault as being one committed &quot;recklessly&quot; thus circumventing the requirement that the prior act of violence be &quot;committed purposely or knowingly.&quot; The court applied the reasonable basis test in rejecting the argument. Under the test, the court searched for any state of facts which could have reasonably sustained an assault under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.13 as a crime of violence and thus usable for the purpose of increasing the degree of the felony offense. A person who committed a prior assault was more likely to commit subsequent acts of violence. Applying the reasonable basis test the statute complained of was constitutional and its application in the case was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among the funeral home's assignments of error was the argument that the trial court had erred in refusing to compel the broadcast company and its agents to answer certain questions put to them upon written and oral examination. Those inquiries pertained to the source of the information that led to the allegedly defamatory statements. The funeral home argued that the sources did not actually exist and that the false statements were published with actual malice. The court agreed with the trial court and held that the broadcasting company had an absolute privilege under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2739.04 to protect its sources and that it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to refuse to order the source revealed. Additionally, the court found that the broadcast company had not relied solely upon the information obtained from that source in determining the truth of the information published. The remaining numerous assignments of error were overruled, and accordingly the judgments of the trial court were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a mother and her minor daughter, filed a personal injury lawsuit against defendant university after a locker in the university's recreational facility fell on the child and injured her. The Ohio Court of Claims entered judgment for the university following a full trial. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the university's recreational facility was available to the public without charge, there was a small fee to rent lockers in a separate locker room. The child was injured in the locker room while the mother was stretching. The trial court applied Ohio's recreational immunity statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.181, to bar plaintiffs' recovery. The trial court also held that plaintiffs were licensees and that the university breached no duty of care owed to plaintiffs. The court overturned the trial court's judgment. First, the court held that plaintiffs were not &quot;recreational users&quot; as contemplated by the statute. While stretching exercises might qualify as a pursuit of an active nature, and require personal involvement and participation, they were not the kind of activity which was normally thought of as a form of outdoor recreation in the same sense as were those which were specifically listed in the statute. Second, plaintiffs were business visitors or invitees with respect to the commercially-operated locker room and there was evidence that the university breached its duty of care to plaintiffs by failing to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court with instructions to reconsider the evidence in light of the duty owed by the university to plaintiffs as invitees, and for further proceedings according to law and consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2929.71 was a penalty enhancing statute; the statute did not constitute a separate criminal offense, therefore, defendant was not tried twice for the same conduct; and (4) theft was an allied offense of similar import to aggravated robbery because theft did not require the proof of any element not required to be proven for the offense of aggravated robbery, so defendant could not be convicted of both.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The witnesses were between six to eight feet from defendant and were close enough to see that there were bullets in the chambers of the gun. The witnesses were shown two photographic arrays. Defendant's photo was the only one that appeared in both arrays. Defendant was convicted of aggravated battery with a gun specification and possession of a firearm while under a disability.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of a trial court (Ohio), which denied defendant's motion to suppress and accepted defendant's plea of no contest to receiving stolen property, possession of criminal tools, tampering with a public utility, theft of utility service, and possession of a motor vehicle with concealed identity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police inspected defendant's business pursuant to Cleveland, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 601.15, which allowed for warrantless inspections of public garages, auto sales lots, motor vehicle salvage facilities, and junk yards. Based on the inspection, defendant was charged with receiving stolen property, possession of criminal tools, tampering with a public utility, theft of utility service, and possession of a motor vehicle with concealed identity. Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence seized by the police, which the trial court denied. Thereafter, defendant pleaded no contest to the charges. On appeal, defendant argued that the Cleveland, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 601.15 was unconstitutional and that the trial court erred in denying the suppression motion. The court held that &sect; 601.15 was constitutional because it involved a closely regulated industry and was carefully limited in time, place, and scope. However, because vehicle parts were not covered by &sect; 601.15 and were not discovered in plain view, the seized vehicle parts should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4123.59 of the Worker's Compensation Act. The employee was declared to be the son's father by default in an earlier paternity action by the mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was declared to be the son's father by default when the employee failed to take a blood test or show up for the trial in the mother's Indiana paternity action. He was found liable for support, but the mother never tried to enforce the award. After the employee was killed in a work-related incident, the son filed for worker's compensation dependency benefits under &sect; 4123.59. A district hearing officer concluded that he was entitled to benefits, which the regional board upheld and the Industrial Commission affirmed. The employer sought judicial review, and the trial court granted summary judgment to the son. The court affirmed, finding that the son fell within the statutory classification of dependency under the express language of &sect; 4123.59(D)(2) because statutory dependency was based solely upon the obligation to support, rather than upon the actual fact of support. Since that was the precise question determined by the Indiana court, and the employer presented no proof of the invalidity of the Indiana paternity proceedings, the Ohio courts were bound to give full faith and credit to the Indiana decision adjudicating the employee to be responsible for the son's support.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sought review of a money judgment entered in favor of appellee village by the Napoleon Municipal Court (Ohio). The complaint was filed by the village originally as a small claim for non-payment of village income taxes, but was subsequently transferred to the civil docket of the trial court. The taxpayers' counterclaims sought a declaration that the tax ordinance was unconstitutional, and costs and damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court struck the taxpayers' counterclaim that the ordinance was not passed and finalized in conformity with state laws and dismissed all other counterclaims. On appeal, the taxpayers argued that the ordinance was not properly published and, as an emergency ordinance, could not have been posted 15 days before its passage as required. The court noted that the village was authorized to pass emergency ordinances, which did not require publication and went into immediate effect. The court also found no error in the dismissal of the taxpayers' counterclaims because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2727.03 and 2731.02 did not give municipal courts jurisdiction to grant injunctions and to issue writs of mandamus. The court found that the delegation of the administrative tax collection duty to the clerk-treasurer was proper. The court also held that the trial court did not err in its refusal to dismiss the village's complaint because it was not brought by a proper party in interest. The court concluded that the action was brought in the name of the right party in interest, the village, and was signed and sworn to by its tax commissioner on behalf of the village and not individually.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the trial court convicting him. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The plain language of a statute authorized the Board of Park Commissioners to promulgate rules to preserve &quot;good order&quot; within the park. That power necessarily included the power to prohibit certain behavior within the parks. The limitation of lewd, lascivious, indecent or obscene acts did not impinge on any constitutionally protected conduct, substantial or otherwise. The rule put defendant on notice that the grabbing of another's groin was prohibited in the Metro Parks. Defendant failed to file a motion to suppress the alleged illegally obtained statements. The first time defendant sought to have the testimony suppressed was in his motion for a new trial. Thus, defendant waived his rights to have the statements suppressed, even if in fact they were illegally obtained. The court held that Cleveland, Ohio, Metropolitan Park District Rule 7.1 could not be used to convict defendant for the utterance of unsworn oral misstatements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the lower court convicting defendant for lewd behavior was affirmed but the conviction for utterance of unsworn oral misstatements was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued among other things, that the trial court committed reversible error and abused its discretion by allowing a police officer to testify as an expert witness with regard to the identification of the marijuana seized. Defendant further argued that the State failed to establish an adequate chain of custody for the substance seized and later identified as marihuana. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the police officer to testify as an expert because the police officer had received specialized training in drug identification where he learned to perform visual identification, microscopic identification, and chemical identification of marihuana. With regard to the chain of custody, the State satisfied its burden of establishing a chain of evidence where the arresting officer placed the substance in a plastic bag to which he affixed an evidence tag containing the date, time and location of where the substance was obtained. The evidence bag was stored in a locked cupboard in the police department laboratory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants asserted on appeal that although they were charged only with first-degree misdemeanors and subject to a maximum sentence of six months, under the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.41(E) there existed the possibility of the filing of additional charges and the possibility of confinement in a state penal or reformatory institution, thus resulting in an &quot;infamous crime&quot; and necessitating a grand jury indictment. The court noted that the record contained only the single charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a first-degree misdemeanor, with no indication that any other charges were pending or contemplated that threatened defendants with confinement in a state penal institution. Defendants also asserted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was void for vagueness. The court noted that the issue raised by defendants went to the testing process and not to the terms of the statute, which were absolute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A landowner purchased two lots having a total area of one-half acre and applied for a building permit. The village denied permission to build because the lots failed to meet the minimum lot size of three-quarters of an acre for single-family dwellings and otherwise failed to comply with the requirements of the zoning ordinance. In reversing the decision, the court held that the landowner had not shown that the ordinance was not rationally related to the public health, safety, and welfare, and had failed to present any evidence that the village's application of the challenged ordinances to his property was unconstitutional. There was no evidence supporting the trial court's finding that other improved lots had shorter frontages. The landowner's grantor had impermissibly divided the total property so that neither part complied with valid regulations, and the courts would not assist an attempt to circumvent the village's lawful authority. The village was not deprived of its right to a jury trial because the landowner's challenge to the validity of the ordinance resembled a proceeding in equity to rescind an allegedly invalid agreement.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded the part of the judgment relating to captains and detectives and held that those officers were not discriminated against in relation to the other officers within those ranks because they all worked the five-two schedule.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which convicted defendant of aggravated murder, two of four capital specifications, a firearm specification, and two counts of aggravated robbery with firearm specifications. The trial court imposed a death sentence as recommended by a jury. The judgment followed a second trial after a judgment in a first trial was set aside because of juror misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was identified by witnesses as the gunman who shot an off-duty police officer who worked at a bank as a security guard, and who then robbed the bank. Defendant was a former employee who had worked at another branch of the bank and who had recently been discharged from employment. The officer died from the gunshot wound. After the robbery, defendant took a bystander's car at gunpoint and drove off in the stolen vehicle. He lent the loaded gun he used in the robbery to an acquaintance. After defendant was arrested, police recovered the gun and the bullets. On appeal, the court held that: (1) an aggravating factor based upon avoidance of accountability by reason of police detection was shown by defendant's shooting of the officer in the bank branch in the course of defendant's intended bank robbery; (2) there was no error in the admission of evidence that concerned defendant's use of a gun in a prior robbery offense because the definition of aggravated robbery included the use of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance; and (3) the trial court's amplification upon the statutory definition of reasonable doubt in an instruction was inadvisable, but not per se reversible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant molested his three-year-old stepdaughter. After he was arrested, he waived his Miranda rights twice and then confessed. At trial, the State introduced the confession and also introduced statements the victim made to a doctor and nurse who treated her immediately following the molestation. On appeal, he asserted that the indictment was flawed because it did not allege a mental state, or scienter, as to the crime. He also challenged the time in which he was brought to trial and the evidence presented. The court held that the indictment was not flawed because gross sexual imposition of a child under 13 years of age was a strict liability crime, precluding the necessity of alleging a mental state. Defendant's speedy trial rights were not violated because a continuance was granted upon his motion. His confession was admissible because he voluntarily waived his Miranda rights before confessing to police. The court also held that the child's statements to the doctor and nurse were admissible pursuant to Ohio R. Evid. 803(2), (4) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.422 because they were directly responsive to questions about her physical condition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged a judgment from the Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio) that denied her claim for a refund of certain sales taxes that were collected by appellee, the Tax Commissioner of Ohio. The Commissioner determined that, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.07, such a refund was to be paid to consumers when the tax was been paid directly by a taxpayer to the state treasurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer paid sales taxes in connection with her purchase of some carpeting from a vendor. The taxpayer claimed that the vendor refused her demand to seek a refund of the taxes. Several years after the taxes were paid, the taxpayer filed a claim for a refund. The Commissioner denied the claim and the Board affirmed that decision. On appeal, the court ruled that &sect; 5739.07, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5307.05, 5739.05(A), and Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 5703-9-07 clearly stated that a consumer, such as the taxpayer, could only obtain a refund of a sales tax paid where that tax was paid by the taxpayer-consumer directly to the state treasurer. Because the taxpayer did not raise in her notice of appeal to the Board her claim that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5709.05 permitted her to file a tax refund claim, the Board, and consequently the court on review, lacked jurisdiction to address the issue, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5717.02. The fact that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.07 did not provide recourse when a vendor refused to file a tax refund did not render the statute violative of due process, under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The taxpayer had the remedy of filing an action in the state's court of claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment of the Municipal Court of Hocking County (Ohio) dismissing two criminal complaints against defendant charging him with taking a deer with a gun in deer zone four during the closed season in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;1531.02 and Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1501:31-17(U) and possessing deer or parts of a deer not properly tagged in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1531.02 and Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1501:31-15-11(O).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that the trial court erred in dismissing the charges on the basis that Ohio Adm. Code &sect; 1051:31-15-08 failed to include the conditions set forth in a free deer damage control permit and thus failed to give notice of proscribed conduct in violation of defendant's due process rights. The court assumed that defendant's violations occurred while he was relying on a right to hunt purportedly granted to him by a friend's deer damage permit. The court nevertheless found no constitutional due process violation sufficient to dismiss the complaint. Defendant argued that Ohio Adm. Code &sect; 1501:38-15-08 was unconstitutionally vague in that it did not set forth the specific conditions upon which permits would be issued. The court held that defendant was deemed to have been aware that under Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1501.31-15-17(U) he could not hunt deer in violation of the provisions of such regulation. He was also deemed to have been aware of Ohio Adm. Code &sect; 1501:31-15-11(O) regulating possession of deer parts unless tagged. Defendant also knew that he had not applied for a deer damage permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners purchased real property with the intention of running their business on it as well as living on the premises.

Later, the village notified the property owners that the land was zoned residential. The property owners challenged the validity of the zoning ordinance, but the court agreed with the trial court that it was constitutional. The court held that the property owners failed to carry their heavy burden of producing evidence clearly demonstrating, beyond fair debate, that the ordinance was arbitrary, unreasonable, confiscatory, and not substantially related to the public safety, morals, or general welfare. The court also found that the village's application of the law to bar the property owners' construction of a commercial building on the property was not arbitrary. Further, the court held that the zoning was not illegal spot zoning based on the topography of the property and the use of the surrounding village.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The central issue was whether appellee county treasurer obtained proper service on the individual in a foreclosure action on a parcel of land. If the service was proper, the purchasers would have obtained good title at the sheriff's sale. However, because service was not proper, the individual was not properly subject to a tax foreclosure action, and the church, as a transferee of the individual, had title to the parcel. Affirming, the court held that the common pleas court intended to cancel the foreclosure sale, and the parties were to return to their pre-foreclosure status. The court found that a foreclosure sale where service had not been accomplished was void and a nullity. Thus, an action that directly attacked a prior foreclosure action on grounds it was void for lack of personal jurisdiction was proper. The individual had a substantial property interest that was adversely affected by the foreclosure sale; thus, she was entitled to notice to apprise her of the pendency of the action. Although mail service was attempted, the address used was over eight years old. The individual was clearly listed in the telephone directory and could have been easily found.</SPAN></P>

The dentists filed suit against the Board and its members, seeking a temporary and permanent injunction, a declaratory judgment, and money damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The dentists alleged that the Board and its members were biased and prejudiced against them and were hostile to the concept of clinical dentistry practiced by the dentists. The trial court denied injunctive relief and found that there was no just cause for delay in the disciplinary proceedings. The dentists appealed, contending that the Board itself, not its Secretary, must have investigated violations and initiated enforcement of state regulations under Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Am. Sub. H.B. 100, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 1983) temporarily increased the annual excise tax imposed upon public utilities by Ohio Rev.

The court found that the tax was an excise tax, not an income tax, and that the tax increase became effective during and prior to the end of the period utilized for the purpose of determining gross receipts upon which the tax was measured. The court held that where the annual excise tax was calculated upon income, whether net income or gross receipts, the tax rate could be changed or increased at any time within the annual period utilized for ascertaining such income, whether net income or gross receipts, for the entire year. Thus, the trial court erred in finding Am. Sub. H.B. 100, &sect; 6, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 1983) unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court also erred in finding Am. Sub.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chief challenged the decision of the Board of Review as being arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise inconsistent with law, in particular that the Board had no jurisdiction to find the civil penalty the Chief assessed unconstitutional, and otherwise erred in finding the civil penalty to be unconstitutional. The court noted that the case was substantially similar in facts as a companion case already decided. The surety in those cases had assumed the reclamation obligation of its defaulting principal. The surety elected to undertake reclamation rather than forfeit the amount of the surety bond, an option available to a surety pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1513.16(F), 1513.02(F)(1). Those statutes also granted to the Chief authority to assess civil penalties. After the surety began reclamation, a violation of the terms of the reclamation was found, and a proposed civil penalty assessment was issued to the surety. The court applied the rationale of the companion case and sustained each of the Chief's assignments of error. The court declined to rule on the constitutional issues raised by the Chief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the Board of Review and remanded the cause to the Board for further proceedings according to law.</SPAN></P>

The court found that: (1) the city had failed to demonstrate that that it had complied with its own regulations, which had required that a copy of the decision be transmitted to the employee; (2) the minutes of the regular meeting were not sufficient to constitute the announcement and transmittal of the city's decision to the employee; (3) the employee's request for review was timely where it had been filed within 10 days of the receipt of notice of the decision; and (4) the claim of impossibility of performance was an equitable relief unavailable to the city because its layoff of the employee had been wrongful.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff residential real estate broker filed a declaratory judgment action against defendants, various agencies and individuals charged with the enforcement of Ohio laws that regulated real estate brokers, which sought a declaration that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4735.18(N) was unconstitutional. All of the parties appealed from the judgment of the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which granted the broker's summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The broker, in conjunction with its corporate parent, implemented a home buyer's discount program pursuant to which the buyer of a home through the broker was provided a book of coupons that permitted purchase of specified merchandise and services from the corporate parent at a discount granted by it within a certain period of time after the closing of the real estate sale. The offer was revealed in the purchase contract. The broker filed its action for declaratory judgment, the trial court granted the broker's summary judgment motion because it found that the broker's practices violated &sect; 4735.18(N), and that the statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment for reasons different from those of the trial court. It found that the statute was an appropriate exercise of the State's police power that did not violate the broker's First Amendment, Substantive Due Process, or Equal Protection rights. Its disclosure requirement was not unduly burdensome. The court found that the consideration was listed in the contract, and it did not matter who provided the consideration. The offer did not violate the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment for the broker, but found that the trial court reached the correct result for the wrong reasons. The declaratory judgment should have been entered as follows: the broker's conduct was not violative of the statute, and as applied to the factual scenario the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of theft, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.01 (A) (1).

The court ruled that counsel was strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance, and defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action could be considered sound trial strategy. Further, the court held that a properly licensed attorney was presumed competent, and therefore the burden of proving ineffectiveness was on defendant.

The trial court found that the statutes governing the local option elections were unconstitutional as they did not provide actual notice to the permit holders before the loss of their licenses. The court agreed with the Department's contention that the trial court lacked jurisdiction as the action could only be brought against the Department in the Franklin County Common Pleas Court as mandated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.31. To the extent the local option election provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.32 failed to provide reasonable notice to the permit holders of an impending local option election, the court agreed with the trial court that the statute was unconstitutional in that it failed to provide the requisite procedural due process mandated by the Ohio and United States Constitutions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Common Pleas of Hancock County (Ohio) dismissed plaintiff property owners' complaint seeking a declaration that defendant city's zoning was unconstitutional as applied to their property and a permanent injunction enjoining the city from enforcing the zoning against the property owners. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' application for a variance to use their property, which was zoned residential, as a professional building was denied. City council also refused to rezone the property. The owners sought a declaratory judgment that the zoning was unconstitutional as applied to their property. The city argued, inter alia, that the owners did not have standing to bring suit. The lower court dismissed the complaint, and the court affirmed. The court first found that the owners' statement that they had exhausted their administrative remedies was sufficient, for purposes of testing the allegations of the complaint, to show exhaustion of the administrative process. The court found that the existence of standing to challenge the constitutionality of zoning in its application depended on the circumstances of each case. In this case, the property owners had knowledge of, or were chargeable with knowledge of, the restrictions on the use of the property but purchased the property intending to use it for a purpose not permitted by existing restrictions. Under these conditions, the owners did not have standing to assert unconstitutionality in the application of the restrictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff electors appealed a judgment of the Summit County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which dismissed their complaint against defendant board of elections contesting the local option election pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3515.08, 3515.09 on the basis of allegations of fraud and irregularities in the election process. As a result of the election, three liquor establishments could no longer sell alcohol for on the premises consumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The election irregularities alleged by the electors involved the casting of 4 votes illegally and the denial of voting rights on the issue to 21 eligible voters. The trial court found that, given the total number of votes cast on the issue and the margin of nearly 3 to 1 by which the voters rejected the sale of liquor for on premises consumption in the two precincts, the electors failed to show that fraud and irregularities in the election process significantly affected the outcome of the election. In addition, the trial court held that the electors had no constitutionally protected interest in a liquor permit. The electors appealed, challenging the trial court's ruling that a liquor permit was not a property right and in finding that they failed to show fraud and irregularities affected the outcome. The court found that the electors had not proven any specific denial of due process inherent in the exercise of the right of local option by residents of the precinct. Further, irregularities in the petition process become moot once the issue were considered by the voters in the election unless any alleged fraud in the petition process was shown.</SPAN></P>

Civ. P. 60(B)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties obtained a dissolution of their marriage. That entry incorporated a separate agreement that provided for the payment of period alimony, but did not contain a specific reservation of jurisdiction in the court to modify future alimony. The ex-wife filed a motion for contempt to compel payment of the alimony. The ex-husband responded with a motion asking that the alimony provision be declared unenforceable on the grounds that he was not represented by counsel when he signed the separation agreement. He also sought relief under Ohio R. Civ. P. 60. The trial court found it did not have jurisdiction to modify the alimony award and found the ex-husband in contempt. It refused to consider the motion under Rule 60. The court held that even though the trial court did not retain jurisdiction to modify period alimony payment, it did retain jurisdiction over an alimony award to the same extent as over any final order. Further, a party could seek relief under Rule 60(B)(4) where it would be inequitable for non-modifiable periodic alimony payments incorporated into a decree of dissolution to have prospective enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court in denying the ex-husband's motion for modification was affirmed. The court reversed the trial court's refusal to consider the second part of the motion, and the case was remanded with the direction to proceed on the ex-husband's motion for relief under the rules of civil procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The surety did not mine the land in question but served as a surety to secure the miner's Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 1513 obligation to reclaim the land. When the miner failed to reclaim the land, the surety chose its option under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1513.16(H)(4) to reclaim the land rather than forfeit the surety bond. The surety filed a request for approval of the reclamation. The chief of the division of reclamation made an inspection and evaluation of the land to determine whether the reclamation met the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 1513. The chief found that the reclamation violated Ohio Adm. Code 1501:13-2-15(F)(1) because more than one percent of the land was barren and that the reclamation violated Ohio Adm. code 1501:13-2-14 because erosion existed on the land. The chief notified the surety that he disapproved the reclamation. The Board adopted a hearing officer's report which disapproved the request for reclamation. The surety appealed, claiming that the chief's order was a &quot;termination of rights to reclaim&quot; order rather than a &quot;disapproval of reclamation&quot; order. The court affirmed, holding that the chief's order was clearly a disapproval order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator had earlier received a permit to operate a landfill. He then sought permission to construct a building adjacent to the landfill to be used as an equipment garage. The Board denied permission, and the operator appealed. The trial court considered the transcript and original papers from the Board's hearing as well as additional evidence first adduced in the trial court pursuant to order under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03; it then ruled in favor of the operator. The Inspector appealed, arguing that the lower court's decision was erroneous because there was no finding that the Board's decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. The court rejected that argument, noting that the proceeding before the lower court was not merely that of a reviewing court in an error proceeding but was a trial de novo. The court noted further that because the Board had not preserved the record of its proceeding, the lower court could seek additional information pursuant to &sect; 2506.03. The court found that the additional evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that the garage building was so necessary to the landfill that it was authorized by implication in the landfill permit.</SPAN></P>

When defendant refused, the manager locked the door and called the police. In the meantime, defendant smashed a cart against the front door and, subsequently, hit the manager in the eye. After the jury found defendant guilty, the trial court sentenced defendant to a minimum of nine to a maximum of 15 years for the robbery and for hitting the manager. As defendant was led out of the courtroom after sentencing, he uttered obscenities. As such, the trial court increased his sentence to a minimum of 10 years. The final journal entry did not mention of the original minimum nine-year sentence. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.11(B)(2)(b) was not unconstitutional as applied and noted that defendant committed an act of violence when he hit the manager.

When defendant's wife returned from work that afternoon, she found her sons dead in bed. Subsequently, defendant was arrested and the gun was found in his suitcase. After defendant was found competent to stand trial under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.37, he waived his right to a jury trial. His case was heard by a three-judge panel, which found him guilty. At a mitigation hearing, evidence was presented that defendant suffered from schizophrenia and from psychogenic amnesia.

The court further held that the trial court properly addressed each mitigating factor enumerated under Ohio Rev.

The security guard was found 75 percent negligent and judgment was entered for her. On appeal, the court held that the indemnification agreement between the security company and its client did not constitute an express waiver of the security company's Workers' Compensation immunity and therefore, it was insufficient to waive the immunity given to a complying employer by the Ohio Constitution. The trial court erred in refusing summary judgment to the architect by holding Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.131&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court could not say that no reasonable person could find the security guard's negligence to be less than the alleged negligence of the client. The verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decisions of the trial court that overruled the security company's and the architect's motions for summary judgment. The court affirmed the decision in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the trial court erred in awarding the painter prejudgment interest and in determining that they failed to make a good faith effort to settle the case.

The painter was injured after falling from a tower he had been painting, due to an electrical shock. The electric lines were at least eight feet above the tower. The court found that neither defendant made an offer of any amount in the case. The court also found that during the course of trial, the employer's expert witness testified that the premises, which were under the control of the employer, constituted a dangerous condition. Because the employer failed to make a settlement offer, the court affirmed the finding that the employer failed to act in good faith. However, the court held that the electric company was not required to make an offer to settle the case because it had a good faith belief that it had no liability. The electric company argued that its negligence was not the proximate cause of the painter's injuries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother alleged that her son was administered oxygen negligently at a municipal hospital for two weeks after his birth in 1961, in such amounts that it caused him to become blind. The trial court granted summary judgment to the city based on its determination that the city's ownership of the hospital was insufficient to subject it to liability. The court found that the city had claimed ownership of the hospital in a 1972 case, which held that a municipal corporation that owned a municipal hospital was liable for the torts of its servants under the doctrine of respondeat superior. The court also found that a 1977 case had applied the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel and determined that the city could not relitigate the issue of ownership and control of the hospital because all questions pertaining to that issue had been properly considered in the 1972 case. Reversing and remanding, the court held that the trial court erred in not applying the law pronounced in the two cases to the issue of the city's liability. The court ruled that the city was a proper party to the action and could be held liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant was not denied a fair trial when the State used its peremptory challenges to remove prospective black jurors because defendant failed to produce any evidence which overcame the presumption that the State used its peremptory strikes appropriately. Although the photographs introduced at trial were gruesome, the court held that they were admissible because they were relevant to issues at trial. Specifically, evidence had been presented that when the victim's body was found, he had been dead for some weeks.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department brought an action under the Act seeking to place appellant in a convalescent home on the ground that her existing living arrangement was unsafe, non-hygienic, and posed a fire hazard to her and others living in her building. The court reversed the order granting the Department permission to relocate appellant and found that the fire hazard and hygiene rationales for relocating her did not reach a magnitude sufficient to warrant moving her against her will because those living conditions could be remedied without requiring her relocation. The court remanded the matter and directed the probate court to authorize the Department and any other public agency with applicable authority to assist and supervise appellant so that she could continue to reside in her existing surroundings or to take other reasonable means to permit her to live alone as she desired. In case bona fide attempts to assist her failed due to her refusal to cooperate with in-home assistance, the court granted the Department permission to place her in a proper convalescent home for her protection after giving her the opportunity for a hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with assault and obstructing official business during an altercation with police. She initially entered a plea of not guilty and requested a jury trial, then pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct. The trial court advised her that by pleading no contest, it was finding her guilty. However, in neither the prosecutor's statement nor the defense attorney's statement at the plea hearing did it appear that a warning or request to defendant to desist her conduct was given by the police officers prior to her arrest. In sentencing her, the trial court assessed jury costs against her, even though a jury was never empaneled. The court held that the jury costs should not have been assessed as part of defendant's sentence because a jury was never empaneled due to her plea of no contest. The conviction had to be reversed because in the explanation of circumstances given, the State failed to establish an essential element of the disorderly conduct offense in that there was nothing to substantiate the necessary element that defendant persisted in her disorderly conduct after a reasonable warning by the police officers to desist. She was guilty only of a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>

When the clerk refused, defendant's companion struck her in the face, and the robbers ran out together, entered the same vehicle, and drove away. On appeal from defendant's conviction and sentence, the court held that: (1) the trial court did not err in sentencing defendant under Ohio Rev.

The court found that the Commissioner's test checks of the company's vending machine operations were lawful. It was incumbent upon the company to prove that the Commissioner's assessment was unlawful. The court agreed with the Board in that the company failed to shoulder its burden. The Board found that one of the company's operations was not a cafeteria as traditionally known. There were no counters on which good was displayed and no food trays or cashier at the end of the line. Furthermore, the company's vending machines were utilized by faculty and other non-students. The court agreed with the Board's determination that the company's law school operation was not a cafeteria and therefore was not exempted from taxation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court overruled the motion in arrest of judgment when defendant failed to appear for the hearing. Defendant's assignments of error all involved his argument that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court explained that defendant was appealing the overruling of his motion to arrest judgment. The court pointed out that defendant merely alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutional in his motion before the trial court. On appeal, defendant argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it attempted to inflict criminal penalties on a debtor relationship. He claimed that it violated due process of law because of criminal penalties for failure to comply with a written assurance of a voluntary compliance agreement. The court did not find that the ordinance violated due process. The court added that defendant's arguments did not support his motion in arrest of judgment. The court explained that defendant's flat assertion that the city ordinance was unconstitutional did not establish an insufficiency in the complaint. The court added that, under Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(B)(2), defendant's plea waived the arguments made on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was indicted for aggravated robbery with firearm specifications and he moved to suppress the identification. The trial court suppressed the in court testimony of one witness but overruled as to the others, and defendant was convicted and sentenced for aggravated robbery. He appealed from the sentence, arguing, inter alia, that the testimony of witnesses who viewed his photograph in the office should have been suppressed and the trial court erred in admitting a deposition where the State failed to establish witness attendance could not be. The court affirmed, holding that accidental confrontation did not violate due process, and there was nothing to indicate that the action of the police in placing the witnesses in the office with the photographs was intentional improper police action. The record reflected little good faith effort to obtain the witness at trial, but in view of the other evidence, the error, if any, was harmless.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(5). He was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum term of three years actual incarceration for the ten-unit sale, since it was a sale of more than the bulk amount of LSD, and one year for the 4-unit sale, the sentences to run concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with selling 10 and 4 &quot;hits&quot; of LSD, respectively, to undercover agents. In a pretrial motion, defendant moved to suppress evidence of the sales because the State had not disclosed the informant who allegedly introduced defendant to the agents. Defendant first contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress without making the identity of the informant available to establish his defense of entrapment. The court held that the request concerned defendant's right to disclosure under Ohio R. Crim. P. 16(B)(1)(f). However, defendant's mere allegation of entrapment, unsupported by any evidence or even allegations of specific improper conduct, was insufficient to require disclosure of the identity of an informant that the State did not call as a witness at trial. Defendant also contended that the guilty finding was contrary to law because the State failed to show that defendant possessed a controlled substance in an amount equal to or exceeding the bulk amount, as defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.01(E)(6). The trial court properly concluded that defendant had sold ten unit doses of LSD, in the form of a four-way blotter acid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Common Pleas Court, Criminal Division (Ohio), which found him guilty of burglary, with violence specifications, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.12 and guilty of theft in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02. Defendant appealed the order denying his motion to dismiss the finding of guilty on the specification count, which resulted in an enhanced sentence pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence for burglary was enhanced and he received a larger minimum sentence of actual incarceration pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.11(B)(2)(b) because he had a prior felony conviction. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.142 provided for the enhanced sentence if defendant had a prior aggravated felony conviction or a conviction under a statute that was &quot;substantially equivalent&quot; to an aggravated felony offense. Defendant claimed that the phrase &quot;substantially equivalent&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction. The court held that the phrase did not confer unrestrained discretion to the trial court. Instead, the statute provided guidelines for the exercise of discretion by requiring the trial court to compare the prior offense to the current offense in an effort to determine if they contained the same or similar elements. In this case, the prior offense statute under which defendant had been convicted contained identical elements of the crime, only the nomenclature had changed. Therefore, the trial court was correct in applying the enhanced penalty provision and no constitutional violation had occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife appealed a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which granted defendant husband an annulment on the basis of fraud. The trial court also found that the husband was not the father of the wife's minor child, declared a third party to be the father, and released the husband from any obligations stemming from the marriage and from any child support obligation or paternal responsibility for the minor child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife argued that the weight and sufficiency of evidence was inadequate to support a finding of fraud, that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine the paternity of the child, that the third party was wrongly joined, and that the child should have been joined with separate counsel appointed in his behalf. The court upheld the judgment. There was clear and convincing evidence supporting the finding of fraud, including the finding that the wife's testimony regarding the timing of sexual intercourse with the husband and the third party was not credible. The trial court had subject matter jurisdiction of the action under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.06. The fact that the wife dismissed her action for divorce on the day of trial did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction. The joinder of the third party was proper under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.04(A) because the third party was the alleged father of the child. There was good cause for not joining the child because the parties stipulated to the results of the genetic testing. Moreover, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.02, there was no longer a conclusive, statutory presumption of a husband's paternity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners challenged a judgment of the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which denied injunctive relief sought by the landowners in their complaint against defendant township for a declaratory judgment. The trial court held that a township zoning ordinance was not unconstitutional as it applied to a certain parcel of real estate owned by the landowners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township was divided into specified zones, which regulated the use of the lands. The landowners' property was classified as &quot;Residential R-1,&quot; which was limited to agricultural uses and single-family homes. The landowners sought to have their property rezoned to &quot;Residential R-2,&quot; which allowed two-family homes. The landowners owned adjacent property that was zoned R-2 and that extended back 175 feet from the road. With the change in zoning, they hoped to extend their R-2 zoned properties to a depth of 600 feet by converting their adjacent R-1 property to R-2 land. After unsuccessfully trying to sell the R-1 property for eight years, the landowners received an offer to purchase the R-1 property contingent upon the landowners obtaining R-2 zoning for the entire property so that the purchaser was able to build duplexes. The township denied the rezoning because of drainage problems on the property. The trial court found that the ordinance was not unreasonable and that there was no unconstitutional taking. The court agreed with the trial court and held that the landowners failed to prove that there was a taking or that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

They proceeded together to the living room, whereupon they discovered the open front door and the bicycle standing near the door. The owner told his mother to go back to the bedroom while he checked the rest of the house. When he returned to the living room, his mother looked very upset and then collapsed. She later died of heart thrombosis. Defendant was convicted of aggravated burglary and involuntary manslaughter. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that he was properly convicted of involuntary manslaughter because he set in motion the events that culminated in the mother's death, and the causal relationship between his criminal conduct and her death was not too improbable, remote, or speculative to form a basis for criminal responsibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee agency received a suspected child abuse complaint concerning a minor child. The trial court issued a judgment finding the minor child to be dependent under &sect; 2151.04(C). The court reversed the decision of the lower court and entered final judgment in favor of the parents of the minor child because almost all the evidence proffered by the agency was inadmissible hearsay. The court found that the agency's intake supervisor testified at the hearing. Her testimony was based on what she was told by others or what she read in the file. The court held that the admission of the hearsay evidence was contrary to Ohio R. Evid. 801 et seq. The court found that the agency could have presented the witnesses who actually made the home visits, made the allegations of abuse, or observed the minor child. The court further found that the agency's failure to allow its records to be produced as evidence affected the parents' right to a fair trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a minor and his parents, challenged the order of the Lucas County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which granted summary judgment to appellees, a hospital, various doctors, and a medical facility. Appellants had brought a medical malpractice claim against appellees seeking recovery for the injury at birth to the minor. Appellants' claim against the hospital was based upon an allegation of negligence by nonprofessional employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the dismissal of their negligence claim against the hospital on the ground that the claim was governed by the two-year statute of limitations set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.10 and that the time for filing the negligence action was tolled until the age of the minor's majority pursuant to &sect; 2305.16. The court held that arguably, an action in negligence against a hospital and its employees might well be governed by &sect; 2305.10 and, therefore, tolled by &sect; 2305.16. However, the record in the action was insufficient for the court to establish that appellants sought relief upon the basis of a medical claim and not an action in negligence. Therefore, the trial court's dismissal of appellants' claim against the hospital was appropriate when the action was filed three years beyond the time set forth in &sect; 2305.11(B). The court found that with regard to the malpractice action, however, the trial court erred in dismissing it based on &sect; 2305.11(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, in part, the grant of summary judgment to the hospital with regard to appellants' negligence claim.

No testimony was offered at the public hearing before the board on the developer's application that the annexation would not be for the general good of the territory to be annexed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that under Ohio Rev.

The focus of the board's inquiry under &sect; 709.033 was properly on the benefit to the area to be annexed, not on the effect of the annexation on the annexing village.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance company acted as a surety for a company's strip-mining activities by posting a performance bond against the satisfactory reclamation of the land.

The Chief issued a proposed civil penalty assessment after finding the insurance company violated the statutory reclamation provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 1513. The insurance company appealed the assessment to the Board. The referee recommended that the proposed civil penalty be vacated because it had been imposed pursuant to an amendment enacted over a year after the surety entered into the surety contract, thus making the penalty an invalid retroactive application of the law. Reversing, the court found that the Board erred in holding that the civil penalty under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 1513.02(F)(1) was invalid merely because the performance bond was executed before the statute created the civil penalty. The civil penalty was applicable because the contract subject matter involved the public welfare, and regulations thereafter enacted, which tended to promote the public welfare ,could be read into the contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rodeo was charged with violating &sect; 959.20, making it unlawful in Ohio to use certain devices to stimulate the performance of work animals that appear in public exhibitions such as circuses and rodeos.

The question before the court on appeal was whether the statute should be construed as an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power insofar as it specifically prohibited the use of one device that had come to be known either as a flank strap or as a bucking strap. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that one of the fundamental rules underlying the doctrine of separation of powers was that any act of the legislature was entitled to a strong presumption of constitutionality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs in two cases, minor children and their parents, appealed from orders of the Courts of Common Pleas of Marion County and Union County (Ohio), which granted summary judgments to defendant doctors in plaintiffs' medical malpractice suits. The judgments were based on the statute of limitations contained in the amendments to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 23045.11, which was part of the Ohio Medical Malpractice Act that took effect on July 28, 1975.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the one case, the alleged malpractice occurred and was discovered on March 30, 1975. The complaint was filed on May 17, 1983, when the child was eight. In the other case, the alleged malpractice occurred and was discovered on March 9, 1973. The complaint was filed on March 10, 1983, when the child was 10. The court affirmed the trial court, holding the application of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2305.11 did not extinguish any vested rights and did not violate plaintiffs' due process rights. Prior to July 28, 1975, the one-year limitation in medical malpractice cases was tolled for minors until after the disability of minority was removed. The Ohio Medical Malpractice Act, including the amendments to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2305.11, required that a malpractice action be brought within one year after the cause accrued, but in any event not more than four years after the alleged malpractice. In the two cases on appeal, the four-year limitation did not operate to destroy causes of action that had accrued before the amendments. Further, plaintiffs in each of these cases were afforded a reasonable time within which to file their complaints after the amendments.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the patient argued that &sect; 2307.43 violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 16, in that it unreasonably discriminated between medical malpractice victims and other tort victims and irrationally discriminated within the class of malpractice victims by denying a complete recovery of damages to the most severely injured and smallest class of victims. The court modified the judgment and affirmed as modified. The court held that the classification of the group shouldering the entire cost of the legislation was irrational and arbitrary. The court found that when only the most severely injured of those injured by medical malpractice was the group upon whom the whole load fell while the intended beneficiary, the general public, bore no part of the load, then irrationality and arbitrariness existed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action was based upon negligent treatment of the mother during the birth of her daughter, which resulted in permanent brain damage to the daughter. The trial court held that the four year limitation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B) barred the action. Reversing, the court noted that the imposition of the maximum four-year limitation period to bar minor litigants' medical malpractice claims violated the Due Process Clause of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The maximum four-year limitation period had no real and substantial relationship to obtaining the State's objective of eliminating the &quot;medical malpractice crisis.&quot; Additionally, the statute was unreasonable and arbitrary. It denied minor litigants access to the courts by placing the burden of litigation upon the parents, and by failing to recognize the limited intellectual and financial resources available to minors. The malpractice claim filed against appellees was filed on behalf of the daughter, a minor. The court held that because it had previously determined that &sect; 2305.11(B) was unconstitutional as applied to minors, the mother's medical malpractice claim was subject to the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the prosecutor was permitted to bring the action on behalf of the real parties at interest pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 309.08. Ohio Rev.

The father failed to object to the examiner's qualifications or testimony at trial and was required to raise objections in the trial court before complaining of errors on appeal. The father's attorney specifically stated at trial he had no objection to the examiner's qualifications, and the trial court then found the examiner qualified as an expert witness. The father never raised an objection or questioned whether the two human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) tests were simply two different names for the same test. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.10(C) stated that evidence of paternity could include statistical probability evidence but that the trier of fact could not rely solely on that evidence. The new Uniform Parentage Act in Ohio did not alter a father's duty to support his child. Fathers always had a duty to support their legitimate and illegitimate children. There was no unconstitutionality with the application of the Uniform Parentage Act in &sect; 3111 to children born prior to the Act's effective date.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the jury returned a verdict in an amount between the complaint demand and the passenger's lowest settlement demand. The court found that the driver did not act in bad faith, but made no effort at all to settle the case. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest. The driver also argued that &sect; 1343.03(C) was unconstitutional because it deprived her of her right to a jury trial. The court noted that the prejudgment interest issue was a collateral matter to a tort action, which did not require a jury trial, even though a monetary award was involved.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The detainee's sister was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) and gave the police the detainee's name.

The detainee was delivered to the custody of the sheriff's matrons. The detainee asserted her innocence, reluctantly surrendered her jewelry, and had her hairpins forcibly removed. The detainee removed her clothing under the matron's orders, but her clothing was not searched. The DUI charge was dismissed. The detainee filed a complaint against the sheriff. The trial court granted the sheriff's motion for a directed verdict. On appeal, the court held that the trial court had failed to apply the proper balancing test of the detainee's privacy interest against the county's interest in security. The record contained sufficient evidence to find that the matrons had performed the strip search for the purpose of humiliating or dehumanizing the detainee. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 311.05 imposed statutory responsibility on the sheriff for the misconduct of the matrons, who were deputies.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3), concentration of ten-hundredths of one gram or more by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of breath, but was sentenced only on the &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) charge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper testified that he observed defendant's vehicle go left of center twice and off the right side berm twice and that, upon stopping defendant, he noticed she had glassy and blood shot eyes and a strong odor of alcohol about her person. The result of defendant's breathalyzer test was .14. On appeal, the court held that the prosecutor was not required to elect between Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4511.19(A)(1) and 4511.19(A)(3). Section 4511.19(A)(3) was not unconstitutionally vague or in violation of due process. The trooper had probable cause to charge defendant with both charges. As to defendant's Miranda contention, the court noted that the prosecution offered no evidence as to custodial statements made by defendant. Evidence of prior or subsequent breath tests using the same calibration solution was properly excluded. The effect of alcohol on the trooper's driving ability was properly excluded. There was no testimony by the trooper as to his opinion of the credibility of the intoxilyzer. Defendant was properly not permitted to inquire about radio frequency waves as indicated on tickets. The calibration affidavit was an Ohio R. Evid. 803(8) exception to the hearsay rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover police officer played a Castle electronic video game at defendant's club and was paid by the barmaid for points that he accumulated on the machine. Defendant was convicted of gambling, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.02(A)(2), and operating a gambling house, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.03(A)(1) and (2). On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that the record did not indicate that defendant had raised the issue of constitutionality at trial but ruled on the issue anyway. The court ruled that the Castle electronic video machine was a game of chance and a gambling device per se. Thus, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2915.02(A)(2) and 2915.03(A)(1) and (2) were constitutional and not arbitrary. The machine was operated on defendant's premises and was designed to produce income for defendant. The court concluded that the State proved the element of &quot;for profit&quot; as to both offenses. Defendant permitted the machines to be played on its premises, made change for patrons to play the machines, and paid a cash prize to those who achieved a certain number of points on the machines. Defendant divided the proceeds from the machines with the owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erroneously excused jurors and refused to excuse jurors based upon their attitudes toward the death penalty, that it failed to instruct the jury that the State was required to prove the aggravating factors for the death penalty beyond a reasonable doubt, and that it failed to instruct the jury on all of the mitigating factors in the imposition of the death penalty. Defendant finally claimed that the verdict was contrary to the evidence in that the State failed to prove the aggravated robbery and the verdict was contrary to the evidence. The court held that the trial court had the discretion to exclude jurors who were unable to follow the instructions of the trial court and the instructions given to the jury were consistent with the evidence presented, since defendant did not offer any mitigating evidence. The court also held that the State was not required to prove the aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In sustaining the dentists' summary judgment motion, the trial court had found that the patient's claims were barred by the applicable one-year statute of limitations, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(A). On appeal, the issue was whether the patient's complaint had been timely filed under the newly amended statute of limitations. The court noted that had the limitations period remained the original 2-year period, it was undisputed that the patient's complaint would have been timely. The question for the court was when the patient discovered, or in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence should have discovered, the injury for which she sought recovery. After examining the evidence, including the patient's deposition, the court determined that the patient discovered and was aware of all of the alleged negligent acts set forth in her complaint more than one year before she filed the complaint. In affirming, the court concluded by finding no facts in the record that supported the patient's estoppel argument and nothing to support the argument that there was a judicial admission to the longer limitations period.</SPAN></P>

A similar city ordinance had been declared unconstitutional because the ordinance could encompass false oral statements concerning the weather and made no allowance for statutory privileges. However, &sect; 2921.13 prohibited false statements made with the purpose to secure public benefits. The statute closely resembled the theft statutes. The court found that defendant committed a species of theft and that the statute was valid. Defendant next argued that her caseworker guided her into making the false statements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Administrator asserted that the claimant's appeal to the Board was untimely and should have been dismissed. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4141.28(H) required that an appeal from a reconsideration decision had to be filed within 14 calendar days after the decision was mailed. Ohio Admin. Code 4146-13-01 provided that filing was deemed to be completed on the postmarked date appearing on the envelope. The claimant's envelope contained a private postal meter mark, not a post office postmark. Because a postal meter mark could be set to read any desired date of mailing, the date on the envelope could not be used to show that it was timely mailed, and it was clear that it was received one day after the statutory deadline. Because the 14-day appeal time was mandatory and jurisdictional, the Board properly dismissed the claimant's appeal. The Administrator also argued that it was error for the trial court to reverse the Board's decision without a finding that it was unlawful. The trial court's failure to specify the basis of its reversal did not constitute non-compliance with the statute. The trial court did not exceed its jurisdiction by the judgment reversing the Board.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the conviction and entered a judgment of acquittal. The actual malice standard enunciated in New York Times v. Sullivan applied to statutes imposing criminal penalties for criticizing public officials and required proof that the statements were made with knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard for the truth. Defendant was entitled to rely on the information supplied by his aides where there was no evidence proving that he knew it was false; therefore, the conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Appellant and a co-defendant edited and reworked another co-defendant's statement about the candidate and published it as a campaign advertisement. The court determined that &sect; 3599.091(B)(10) was constitutional because there was a compelling state interest in preventing the publication of false statements concerning the election or defeat of a candidate for office. The court explained that the trial court properly denied the motion for separate trials because the co-defendants merely corroborated appellant's own admission that he edited the material. The court noted that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing an in camera inspection of the unsuccessful candidate's grand jury testimony because appellant was permitted to impeach her testimony by other testimony. The court concluded that because of appellant's previous experience as a township trustee and his personal involvement in local politics, he was not justified in his reliance on the information and he acted in reckless disregard of the truth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused by a losing candidate of violating campaign practices law, by publishing a circular that contained false information. Defendant was convicted as charged. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction that was entered by the trial court. The court held that the state statute expressly limited a conviction to cases where there was proof that the statements were known to be false or were made in reckless disregard of falsity. Thus, the statute was in compliance with the United States Supreme Court standards. In this case the court held that there was no evidence that defendant knew the information to be false. Moreover, the allegations contained in the circular were not inherently improbable, so that defendant could be said to have published them in reckless disregard of the truth. Although the procedural errors alleged by defendant were either not error or were harmless, the court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction which effectively curtailed defendant's right of free speech.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also claimed that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence because his conviction was based upon circumstantial evidence that was consistent with a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction. The statutory definition of reasonable doubt provided the proper standard for ensuring an accused's rights to due process, and the state supreme court previously had ruled that it was not constitutionally infirm. The circumstantial evidence, consisting of the victim's fresh injuries on the night in question, was fully substantiated by her parents, the investigating officer, medical records, and photographs, and provided no reasonable hypothesis of defendant's innocence.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and concluded that &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was constitutional. Although the exact concentration of alcohol was determinable only by proper tests, the illegal conduct, which was the operation of a vehicle with the prescribed concentration of alcohol was readily ascertainable from the face of &sect; 4511.19(A)(3).

On appeal, the resident argued that the board's decision was not supported by the evidence and denied him equal protection of the law. The appellate court rejected these contentions. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the board's decision because the term &quot;shopping center&quot; contemplated something more than the structure occupied by the resident under the facts of the case. The resident was not denied equal protection of the law because he could not submit any combination of facts that might qualify his structure as a shopping center.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged the decision of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which affirmed an order in favor of appellee Ohio Department of Agriculture. The order found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.11(A)(8) authorized the department's action in laying the employee off from his position. The department contended that the action became necessary because the employee's position was exempted to an unclassified position.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the adverse judgment, the employee contended that the judgment was contrary to law and not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. The court reasoned that the layoff was attempted pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.321(D), which provided that employees could be laid off as a result of abolishment of positions. However, the court reasoned that the duties which comprised the employee's position remained and were performed, in full, by another employee who replaced the employee. The court held that &sect; 124.321(D) defined &quot;abolishment of position&quot; as meaning the permanent deletion of a position or positions from the organization or structure by an appointing authority due to lack of continued need for the position. The court concluded that the findings of the hearing officer tended to indicate that the employee's position was not abolished within the statutory meaning of abolishment. Rather, as the hearing officer expressly found, there was no abolishment but, instead, a supplanting of the employee in a classified position with an unclassified employee, which the Ohio Supreme Court had expressly held to have been improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the action to the trial court for the purpose of remanding the action to a board of review for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged the decision of the Marysville Municipal Court (Ohio), which dismissed the complaint against defendant, finding that it violated defendant's double jeopardy rights. Defendant had been charged with domestic violence, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed defendant's complaint for constituting an unconstitutional vexatious prosecution. The trial court took judicial notice of an earlier domestic violence complaint filed against defendant. The earlier complaint had been dismissed on the oral motion of the complainant to dismiss the charges against defendant. The second complaint was dismissed by the trial court for violating defendant's double jeopardy rights. The State appealed, and the court reversed. The court ruled that the second complaint did not place defendant in double jeopardy. Although the trial court recited that the first complaint came on for a hearing, there was nothing in the record that showed notice of a hearing. In addition, the allegations of the two complaints were distinct despite the similar language used. Citing authoritative precedent, the court held that a nolle prosequi before the jury was sworn did not constitute jeopardy and that the mere arraignment and plea to an indictment did not put an accused in jeopardy. The court found that this law was equally applicable to prosecutions by complaint as well as it was to prosecutions by indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court, and it remanded the cause to the trial court for a trial on the domestic violence complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Division issued a show cause order to the salesman alleging that he was involved in the unauthorized sale of securities without a license.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1707.44(A0, 1707.14(B). The salesman appealed, and the trial court heard testimony and found that the consent order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and was in accordance with law. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the trial court's review pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12 was limited to whether substantial evidence supported the Division's order and thus it was not required to rule on each of the salesman's assignments of error. The court stated that its review was limited to whether the trial court abused its discretion in its review of the Division's order. Substantial evidence supported the conclusion that the salesman engaged in a sales transaction by accepting money and obtaining signatures on subscription agreements other than through a licensed dealer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted ordinances that provided that the cost of a road-widening project would be met by assessments levied upon property lots bordering the road. The resident, who lived on the road, filed initiative petitions repealing the ordinances and the citizens voted to adopt the initiative ordinance, which provided that &quot;any and all further legislation&quot; adopted by the city commission referring to the widening and improvement of the road was to be repealed. The city then filed a complaint pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 133.71 seeking validation of municipal bonds for the project. The court held that the city had standing to file the action. Considering the objective of the initiative ordinance and its substantial impact upon the then existing contractual obligations of the city at the time the ordinance went into effect, the court held that the initiative ordinance operated as a substantial impairment of appellee's contractual relationship, and accordingly, was unconstitutional for that reason. Further, the constitutional portion of the initiative ordinance could not have been severed from the unconstitutional portion abrogating the construction phase of the project.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee incurred an occupational disease and claimed entitlement to workers' compensation benefits. The employee alleged that the trial court erred in failing to award sanctions and costs against the employer relating to the employee's efforts to compel discovery and to hold the employer in contempt for noncompliance. The employer, as the prevailing party, claimed that the trial court erred in assessing costs against it. On appeal, the court held: (1) the trial court's refusal to impose sanctions against the employer for discovery delays was not an abuse of discretion, as the trial court had broad discretion in deciding whether to impose sanctions; (2) the trial court improperly refused to impose sanctions and costs against the employer after the employee was forced to file a motion for contempt because the trial court failed to make a specific finding regarding why costs were not assessed; and (3) the trial court erred in assessing costs against the employer because under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.519, costs could not be assessed against the employer where the employee failed to establish his right to participate in the fund.</SPAN></P>

The cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant harbored a number of Siberian Husky dogs on his premises. The original complainant, a nearby neighbor, testified that the sustained and continuous howling of the dogs awakened him. He further testified that this howling had occurred on numerous occasions; that he had seen five dogs outside at one time; and that he had seen defendant sprinkling the dogs with a hose to quiet them. Defendant was convicted of violating Whitehall, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 505.03, keeping an animal that disturbed the peace. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the ordinance was not vague because it addressed a specific neighborhood, incorporated an objective standard, and gave specific factors to measure the disturbance. The testimony regarding defendant's relationship to the dogs prior to the night stated in the original complaint was properly admitted as evidence of the relationship between defendant and the dogs showing conduct that could be described as harboring. A deed was properly introduced as evidence that defendant was the owner of the premises upon which the dogs were kept.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant infant sought review of a judgment of the Lucas County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which granted appellee hospital's motion to dismiss. The infant had been born at the hospital in 1976. The infant had filed his action against the hospital in 1984, alleging that he suffered substantial brain damage because the hospital and its agents and employees failed to properly monitor him during and after his birth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the infant's claims were barred by the statute of limitations set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B). The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. From that judgment, the infant filed a timely notice of appeal. The court reversed the judgment. The court held that the infant was a minor litigant who had filed a malpractice claim against the hospital. Because the court had previously determined that &sect; 2305.11(B) was unconstitutional as applied to minors, the infant's medical malpractice claim was subject to the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16. As &sect; 2305.16 provided for the tolling of the statute of limitations until the infant reached the age of majority, the trial court erroneously granted the hospital's dismissal motion.</SPAN></P>

Further, the company was not entitled under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3734.05(D)(2) to an exemption from licensing as an existing facility when regulations under Ohio Rev.

During voir dire, the defense was not permitted to ask the victim how they would feel if they were black and charged with a crime and were in front of a jury that was all white. Defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery. The court affirmed his conviction. The court held that defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's limit on the questioning of prospective jurors because the defense was given the opportunity to question the jurors regarding their possible racial bias. The court also ruled that the one-on-one showup at the police station was not unconstitutional where the victim had an opportunity to view the victim before the crime, he was able to give reasonably accurate description of defendant, and his identification was shortly after the alleged crime occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a decision of the Wood County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which granted defendant's motion to suppress certain evidence related to drug charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested on drug charges. On appeal, the State argued that the trial judge erred by suppressing evidence found during the search of defendant's residence on the basis that the search warrant was illegally issued to an agent of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation. The court reversed the suppression of evidence, holding that the agent of the bureau had the authority to assist any sheriff, chief of police, or other law enforcement officer in the investigation and solution of any crime or to control criminal activity, and thus such agent was a law enforcement officer within Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2901.01(K). Further, the warrant was executed by an officer other than the named officer and thus was valid. In addition, even if the warrant was defective for some highly technical reason, the property seized should not have been suppressed because the deputy executing the warrant was acting in good faith. The court also held that the issuance of the warrant in the name of the bureau agent was non-constitutional in magnitude, and the exclusionary rule should not have been applied by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims identified defendant as the burglar of their home. Defendant fit the victims' description, and defendant was trying to hide the same amount of money that was stolen from the victims' home in the police car. Defendant was then arrested for a violation of his probation based on the offenses, and a parole holder was placed on him. His trial was held more than 90 days but less than 270 days after his arrest. Defendant claimed that he was entitled to a special jury instruction regarding eyewitness identification under Ohio R. Crim. P. 30 and that his speedy trial rights were violated. The court held that the convictions were proper. Defendant was not entitled to a special jury instruction because the identification of defendant was not suspect when the description of him was accurate, the victims had just seen defendant, and the circumstantial evidence clearly incriminated defendant. Defendant's speedy trial rights were not violated where he was being held on the violation of probation charge. Thus, the time limits under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71(C)(5), and not &sect; 2945.71(D), (E), applied. The 270-day time limit in which to hold a trial under &sect; 2945.71 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Expert testimony to attack the witnesses' credibility was improper because the testimony would have been improper extrinsic evidence under Ohio R. Evid. 608(A) and the witnesses were mentally healthy persons of average intelligence. An expert's use of the phrase &quot;extremely likely&quot; in regards to matching hair samples was proper. Although the death penalty statute had a different set-up than other states' death penalty statutes that were declared constitutional, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03(D)(2) was still constitutional. The class of felony murderers was properly narrowed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A)(7). Defendant's attorney was not required to obtain a pre-sentence report. The mitigating factors under &sect; 2929.04(B)(7) were not vague, though they were undefined and only factors relevant to defendant were to be used to impose the death penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city prosecuted the two corporations after it determined that they had withheld employees' wages for city tax but failed to file a tax return or pay the withholding taxes. The officer was served as the statutory agent, but she was not named in the complaint. The trial court convicted the corporations and the officer and sentenced the officer to imprisonment along with a fine, penalties, and taxes. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions of the corporations. Their argument that federal tax liens prevented them from paying did not provide a sufficient defense. Intent, although not stated in the ordinance, was implied and was necessary for conviction where the penalty included imprisonment because Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 15 prevented imprisonment for the mere failure to pay taxes, in the absence of wilful refusal or fraud. The conviction of the officer was reversed for plain error because she had not been provided the elementary protections of due process.</SPAN></P>

The rape counts contained specifications for purposely compelling the victims, her sons, to submit by force.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's children were taken into county's children's services and upon investigation it was revealed that defendant's three sons and her daughter were all sexually abused by both defendant, her husband, and the children's two uncles. Defendant was sentenced to three terms of life imprisonment on the rape charges and four terms of imprisonment for not less than two nor more than five years on the child endangering charges, all terms to run consecutively. On appeal she argued that the trial court erred in failing to grant her motion to dismiss the specifications from each of the three counts of rape. The specifications, per Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(B), stated that the victims were compelled to submit by force or threat of force. The court disagreed and held that the requirement of a threat of force per Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.02(A), was satisfied if the fear of the alleged victim was of such a nature as in reason and common experience is likely to induce a person to part with property against his will by virtue of the influence of the terror impressed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The benefitted trustee and the other trustees voted to give the benefitted trustee expanded health insurance benefits at the township's expense. The township brought an action for reimbursement of the premiums on the claim that the increased benefits was an improper in term raise. Although they admitted that the raise was illegal, all of the trustees claimed that they were not liable because the decision was a good faith error. The court held that all of the trustees were liable. The court reasoned that, although judicial precedent stated that good faith payments by a government agency protected the trustees from liability, the judicial precedent stated that the specific payments were illegal under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 20. Thus, the payments could not have been made in good faith. The insurers were not liable for the premiums because they had no notice that the benefitted trustee was receiving improper extra benefits because they merely issued a group plan. The affidavit of the benefitted trustee's attorney regarding the authenticity of the records of the township was valid under Ohio R. Civ. P. 56(E) because the attorney had personal knowledge that the records were authentic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from defendant's extortion conviction, the court overruled his first assignment of error regarding the trial court's denial of his request for the victim's complete medical records and a psychological examination because, although defendant cited Ohio R. Evid. 402, he failed to assert precisely how the evidence was relevant to any issue before the trial court. The court also found that defendant was afforded ample opportunity to examine the issues during his cross-examination of the victim. The court determined that defendant's claim of prosecutorial misconduct was not supported by the record because he failed to cite any portion of the record which could have constituted improper argument or suggestion of personal opinion of guilt by the prosecuting attorney and he failed to object to the prosecutor's comments at the time they were made. In affirming the judgment, the court adopted another appellate court's holding, which was that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.71 was not void for vagueness and did not violate due process because it gave a person of ordinary intelligence reasonable notice that its contemplated conduct was forbidden and it did not encourage arbitrary arrest.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the juvenile court exceeded its jurisdictional authority by its order to enroll the child because the compulsory school attendance law was enforced through separate proceedings pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimed that her daughter sustained certain birth-related injuries and that these injuries were caused by defendants' negligence. Both defendants contended that plaintiff's cause of action, filed more than 13 years after the alleged negligence, was barred by the four-year statute of limitations as applied to minors in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B). Plaintiff responded that that the four year bar of &sect; 2305.11(B) should not be followed because it violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. On appeal, the court held that there were various reasons why &sect; 2305.11(B) was enacted, including the fact that it had become increasingly difficult to investigate stale malpractice claims. Since there was a rational basis for the four-year bar of &sect; 2305.11(B), the statute did not violate due process. Because there was no genuine issue of material fact or a claim upon which relief could be granted, the motion for summary judgment of the physician and the motion to dismiss of the hospital were properly granted by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that defendants improperly administered a series of vaccinations for diptheria-pertussis-tetanus to the minor patient when she was only four months old. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that defendants continued the vaccinations, contrary to accepted medical practice with the result that the girl's mental development was permanently halted. On appeal, the court rejected the argument concerning the Supreme Court having engaged in an unconstitutional exercise of judicial legislation since the court was in no position to nullify an act of the Supreme Court. Further, the fraudulent concealment of facts nevertheless did not toll the running of the malpractice statute of limitations. Because the gist of the allegations was medical malpractice, the applicable limitation was found in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11. A similar result would have applied had plaintiff sought a longer limitation by characterizing his professional malpractice cause of action against a physician as a breach of the contractual relationship.

Appellant filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the first suspension hearing. The court ruled that defendant did not support his allegation because there was no transcript. The court added that defendant was permitted to make all his arguments at his second suspension hearing. At the second hearing, the trial court stated that the license was suspended on the basis of defendant's intoxilyzer test results and a previous conviction of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of liquor. Acknowledging that the evidence was hearsay, the court explained that there was no constitutional prohibition to suspending driver's licenses based on hearsay evidence. The court also rejected defendant's other arguments and held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was questioned by the police in connection with an apparent double homicide. The police performed an atomic absorption test on defendant's hands to determine whether he had recently fired a gun. Defendant acknowledged the presence of gunpowder on his hands and explained that shotgun shells and firecracker powder could be found in a container at his residence. The police found the cannister containing powder and firecrackers. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the results of the atomic absorption test, his oral statements to the police, and the cannister taken from his home on the basis that his Fourth Amendment rights had been violated. The trial court suppressed the evidence, finding that when defendant was transported to the police station, he was &quot;seized&quot; within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and both seizures were unsupported by probable cause. The court affirmed that judgment. Defendant believed that he was not free to leave the police station. He was placed in a small room by himself, was given Miranda warnings, and was interrogated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner operated a business on a piece of property that was re-zoned as &quot;R-2,&quot; or one- and two-family residential.

The board reversed the zoning certificate on the basis of Athens, Ohio, Zoning Ordinance, which provided that the board could allow the substitution of a non-conforming use by another non-conforming use if no structural alterations were made. However, in an R-District no change could be authorized to any use that was not permitted in any R-District. Public offices were not permitted in an R district. The trial court reversed the board's decision. On appeal, the court found that the only restriction that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 713.15 placed on zoning ordinances for the substitution of nonconforming uses was that the provision for substitution be &quot;reasonable.&quot; Here, the city ordinance allowed substitution freely if the substituted use was not more objectionable than the prior use and, in the case of a residential zone, was allowed as a permitted use in any R zone.

The court of common pleas found that his claim for total disability, which was caused by asbestosis, was time barred under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.68(y) (repealed 1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant applied for workers' compensation total disability benefits because of his asbestosis, and his claim was denied at the administrative level because the one-year statute of limitations under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.68(y) (repealed 1978) expired before he filed his claim. The court reversed the common pleas court's order, which granted summary judgment in favor of the Administrator, and remanded the matter for further administrative proceedings. In its ruling, the court declared that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.68(y) (repealed 1978), which was in effect when the claimant's asbestosis condition was diagnosed, was unconstitutional. Because that statute was unconstitutional, the general two-year statute of limitations under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.85 applied to his claim. He filed his claim for benefits within two years after the disability, so he should have received a hearing on his claim pursuant to &sect; 4123.85. In its decision, the court relied on recent case law that specifically eliminated the justifications for a special classification for asbestosis. Medical advances allowed more accurate diagnosis of the disease and reduced the risk of fraudulent claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants were a husband and wife, and a boyfriend, who was the father of the wife's child.

The claimants had indicated to the State that the boyfriend was the child's father. The federal court granted a temporary restraining order based on the State's consent, but ordered the case dismissed upon the filing of a complaint in state court. The claimants filed the current action, and the trial court granted a temporary restraining order. The State voluntarily changed the birth certificate of the child listing the boyfriend as the father.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for speeding. The police officer detected an odor of alcohol emanating from defendant. Defendant failed several roadside sobriety tests. About 30 minutes after defendant last drove his van, the officer administered an intoxilyzer test, which indicated that defendant's blood alcohol level was .132 percent. In seeking a reversal of his drunk driving conviction, defendant argued that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence, because the State failed to establish that the result of the breath test administered 30 minutes after he last operated his van indicated that his blood alcohol level was in excess of .1 percent at the time he operated his vehicle. In affirming the drunk driving conviction, the court held that an intoxilyzer, if conducted within 2 hours after the offense and in accordance with Department of Health guidelines, was indicative of a defendant's blood alcohol level at the time of the offense. The court found that the State provided the proper foundation indicating that defendant was tested within 2 hours of the offense in accordance with Department of Health guidelines on a properly calibrated and working machine.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also fined the corporate officer, sentenced him to 60 days in the workhouse and to one year of inactive probation, and suspended the costs and 57 days of imprisonment. The court reversed the judgment and vacated the sentence. The court held that the trial court improperly found the corporate officer guilty, as he had never been formally charged with any violation of the municipal tax code. Any such indictment not so framed was defective. A person was not allowed to have been punished for a crime without a formal and sufficient accusation even if he voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the trial court. The surname of a defendant must have been alleged in the charging part of the accusation, and its omission therefrom was fatal to the accusation or indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a police association, appealed a decision of an Ohio common pleas court, which denied interest damages on a retroactive wage increase granted by defendant City, pursuant to binding arbitration. The City appealed a trial court ruling that a binding arbitration provision in a labor agreement was not an unlawful delegation of legislative power and that the City's tardiness in approving the arbitration award was a breach of contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association applied for confirmation of an award after binding arbitration for an impasse in negotiations on a wage increase for patrolmen. When the case was pending, the City Council implemented the award by an ordinance making the wage increase retroactive to the date set by the arbitrators. The court found no error in the determination that the arbitration provision was not an unlawful delegation of legislative powers under Cleveland, Ohio, Charter &sect; 191. Because the City retained its powers and properly exercised them by establishing standards for the arbitration panel, there was no unlawful delegation of powers. Also, by the City's approval of the award, the City adopted the panel's report as its own. The City was estopped from repudiating the contract by its participation in the arbitration and by its failure to seek judicial review. The court found that the City's delay did not constitute a breach of contract where time was not of the essence and there was no definite time prescribed within which the City had to approve. Because there was no breach of contract, there was no interest due on the retroactive pay increase, and the contract did not provide for interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained an assignment of error regarding the City's breach of contract. Since no damages were due, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of trafficking and counterfeit controlled substances in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.37. Defendant filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The motion was denied. The court held that &sect; 2925.37 was a necessary legislative act protecting the public from counterfeit substances and did not infringe on constitutionally protected conduct. Defendant had adequate warning that the sale of a counterfeit substance was a criminal offense. Defendant thus failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality by proof beyond all reasonable doubt. The court found that intent to sell a counterfeit substance was a material element of the indicted offenses. Any reference to a prior offense was corroborative of other evidence presented proving defendant's intent by indicating a lack of mistake in the transactions that were the subject of the charges against him. This corroborative evidence included the testimony of six witnesses who testified in regard to the transactions involving the sale of counterfeit substances to the narcotic agent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Ohio Supreme Court effectively amended &sect; 2305.11(B) by it interpreting it to set a four-year maximum statute of limitations for minors' medical malpractice claims occurring before their tenth birthday. When the supreme court rendered that interpretation it voided a tolling provision that was applicable to the minors, and caused the limitations period to have already expired when the minors filed their claims that their injuries occurred at the time of their birth. The court reversed the dismissal of the minors' actions because &sect; 2305.11(B) was unconstitutional by taking away a vested property right, their causes of action, without due process as required by Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The trial court improperly applied &sect; 2305.11(B) retroactively to the minors' claims because the supreme court's interpretation, which required the minors to file their actions by their fourth birthday, obliterated their claims without affording them a reasonable time to enforce their property rights. In addition, &sect; 2305.11(B) as interpreted by the supreme court was not rationally related to the legislature's purpose for enacting the statute to prevent an alleged medical malpractice crisis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio appealed a judgment of the Marysville Municipal Court (Ohio), wherein that court dismissed a charge brought by the State Game Protector against defendant for illegally hunting rabbits, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1531.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that it was error for the trial court to dismiss the charges because it had not filed a written motion contra to defendant's motion to dismiss. The court held that no special rule of the trial court was cited pertaining to elimination of oral hearing and there was nothing in the rule specifically requiring that there be a response filed by the opposing party or that the motion prevail simply by default in such reply. It was further asserted that it was error for the lower court to conduct a hearing on defendant's motion to dismiss without notice to the State. Because Ohio R. Crim. P. 47 contemplated an oral hearing, and because there was no local rule that provided for determination without oral argument, the trial court had no authority to dismiss without a hearing. Defendant maintained that the errors were not prejudicial because even if he did the act alleged in the affidavit, it was not an offense punishable under the statutes. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1531.02 and Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1501:31-15-17(e), it was illegal to hunt rabbits on that date in the zone specified in the charge.

He argued that aesthetics was the primary objective in enacting the ordinance and that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague.

On review the court found that the trier of fact could have found that all the essential elements of the offense had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of no contest to a charge of involuntary manslaughter, which included a specification that he had been previously convicted of armed robbery.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for aggravated burglary and voluntary manslaughter. Both charges contained a specification that he had a previous armed robbery conviction. Defendant objected to the use of his prior armed robbery conviction to enhance his possible sentence, but the objection was overruled. Defendant entered a no contest plea to the voluntary manslaughter charge. The trial court overruled defendant's motion to vacate the plea and enhanced his sentence pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.11(B)(1)(b). The judgment was affirmed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion because he had a complete hearing on his motion, and there was nothing to suggest that the plea was made by mistake, or under a misconception of the charge, or through any misrepresentations. The court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 2929.11(B)(1)(b) violated his constitutional rights. Section 2929.11(B)(1)(b) did not contemplate a nonjudicial determination of guilt and was not a bill of attainder. Moreover, &sect; 2929.11(B)(1)(b) apprised defendant that enhanced penalties accompanied new crimes and was not an ex post facto law and did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled the motion to dismiss and the amended motion for new trial and ordered the sentence to commence. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, and held that &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was not unconstitutional. The court held that the ascertainable standard of guilty was the precise proportion of alcohol concentration to breath, a readily ascertainable ratio that was determined by the prescribed blood alcohol tests. Although the exact concentration of alcohol was determinable only by proper tests, the court held that the illegal conduct, the operation of a vehicle with the prescribed concentration of alcohol, was readily ascertainable from the face of the statute. The court held that a person of ordinary intelligence should have no difficulty recognizing that abstinence or moderation was a simple means of ensuring compliance with the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife challenged a judgment of the Ross County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which denied the wife's claim for benefits allegedly due under a life insurance policy, issued by appellee insurer, covering the decedent, who was her late husband. The wife argued that the trial court erred in overruling her motion to exclude all testimony pertaining to the decedent's medical records, on the grounds that such evidence was privileged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent purchased a life insurance policy a year before he died of heart problems. The insurer asserted that the decedent gave false answers on his insurance application by failing to mention that he had heart trouble. A doctor working for the decedent's employer testified that he sent the decedent letters mentioning the heart problems. A second doctor testified as to notes that he had made in the decedent's medical records. The wife asserted that the doctors' testimony should have been excluded on the grounds of the doctor-patient privilege. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly allowed the first doctor to testify because the doctor was not the decedent's treating physician, therefore, his testimony was not privileged. The court also held that the second doctor's testimony was properly admitted because the doctor had not testified to any privileged information. The court held that the trial court properly instructed the jury concerning the wife's burden of proof. The court ruled that once the insurer had shown that the decedent made an untrue statement, the burden shifted to the wife to prove that the decedent made an honest mistake in making the statement.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's argument, noting that the constitutionality of &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) had previously been determined in prior decisions. In so ruling, the court cited with favor portions of prior decisions that highlighted the cost in dollars and human life from drunk driving and the connection between the legislation and public safety.

Defendant contended that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that a person acting in cooperation with a governmental agent could perpetrate entrapment and that the definition of &quot;unit dose&quot; was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, defendant met with the undercover agent and sold him 10 &quot;hits&quot; of LSD. Defendant testified that the confidential informant had previously requested him to sell some LSD for him. Defendant stated that the LSD sold to the undercover agent was that given to him by the confidential informant. In his jury instructions, the trial judge stated that a police officer, specifically referencing the undercover agent, could commit entrapment under certain circumstances. Defendant objected, contending that the instruction failed to indicate that the confidential informant could also perpetrate entrapment. The court held that the trial court erred in failing to so instruct the jury because an informant, acting on behalf of a law enforcement officer, could perpetrate entrapment. The court also concluded that the term &quot;unit dose&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague because men of common intelligence readily understood it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city found that a building next to the building occupied by the tenants constituted a nuisance. The city hired the contractor to demolish it. The demolition caused damage to the tenant's building. The tenants brought suit against the city and the contractor for damages. The trial court entered judgment for the tenants. The court affirmed the judgments with respect liability but reversed the judgments upon the issue of damages. The city was not immune from liability where the city negligently planned, designed, and contracted for the demolition of a structure, which was a ministerial act in the implementation and execution of a basic governmental policy. The city had a duty to make certain that adjoining property owners were protected against injury by the demolishing of the building. The trial court erred in finding that the city violated the constitutional rights of the tenants so as to be liable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. In the absence of evidence, there was no basis upon which to award damages to the tenants for loss of goodwill in addition to an award for loss of profits. The tenants were not entitled to prejudgment interest under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1343.03.</SPAN></P>

Instead of sentencing him to a minimum term of eight to 12 years in prison and adding a maximum of 15 years under Ohio Rev.

Defendant was not entitled to a bill of particulars. An indictment stated specifically the nature of the offense so that he could prepare a defense.

The trial court dismissed the appeal, observing that the landowner could appeal only if the director of environmental protection had not made an order declaring the improvements necessary. The court affirmed the dismissal because Ohio Rev.

The court noted that neither the legislature nor the trial court determined that the landowner was without remedy of judicial review. The only determination was that statutory appeal to the trial court was not available under those circumstances where the county commissioners had acted in response to the commandment of the director of environmental protection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bus driver was terminated from her position for a chronically unsatisfactory work performance record.

The court reversed the trial court's decision remanding the case back to the school board and affirmed the school board's decision to terminate the bus driver. The trial court should not have remanded the cause back to the school board. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3319.081(C), the trial court had the power to affirm, disaffirm, or modify the school board's decision, but there was no provision for remanding the cause back to the school board for further proceedings. The bus driver's attorney was given the opportunity to subpoena witnesses and did in fact compel the attendance of at least one witness. The hearing was in sufficient compliance with the demands of due process set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3319.16 because the board members were able to make a decision on the bus driver's termination after both sides presented evidence.</SPAN></P>

The dealership counterclaimed alleging breach of contract. The jury returned a verdict for the consumer. Thus, the trial court awarded her damages and attorney fees. The parties' appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. The dealership waived the defense of improper venue because it never sought a change of venue. In view of the testimony regarding damage to the car there was ample evidence to support the jury's conclusion that the car was used and thus, that the dealership violated the &quot;new for used&quot; rule. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in its award of attorney fees. In view of the presumption covering the constitutionality of any statute, the alleged unconstitutionality of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was killed in a bar after closing. Detectives interviewed defendant as one of the last people to leave the bar. As the result of an anonymous tip, defendant's bloody clothing was found. Defendant agreed to go in for questioning. At the station, the detective confronted defendant with the clothing, informed him he was a suspect, and read him Miranda. Defendant made inculpatory statements and was arrested. Defendant led the detective to the rest of the bloody clothing, weapons, and the bar deposit envelope. Defendant's preliminary motions were denied. The trial court convicted defendant and imposed the death penalty. A mandatory appeal followed, and the court affirmed. Defendant was not entitled to dismissal because the death penalty was not unconstitutional per se, was not cruel and unusual punishment, was not applied arbitrarily, and did not violate his equal protection rights. Because defendant was 28 years old, he was not a youthful offender, and it was proper to reject his plea under Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(C)(3). Defendant's other claims of error were meritless. The court reviewed the factors mandated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.05(A) and found that there was no error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant erected its sign before the city enacted new legislation which limited the height of free standing signs. Under the ordinance, no non-conforming sign could be reconstructed or altered by the changing of any lettering or message unless it was designed as a conforming sign. Defendant, in changing the message on the sign for another one of his businesses, vertically realigned the sign, thereby reducing the height and expanding the width. The location and size of the new sign conformed with the ordinance, except for the height. The court held that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 713.15, the city could not enact a zoning ordinance affecting an existing structure, without permitting the structure to remain, unless the nonconforming use was voluntarily discontinued for two or more years. The court found no error in the trial court's finding that there was no substantial change in the sign and that the modification did not change its use, as it was still an advertising sign. However, the court held that the trial court should not have ruled on the constitutionality of the ordinance, as the case could be disposed of on other grounds.</SPAN></P>

Finally, the court concluded that defendant was found guilty of the specification of killing a peace officer beyond a reasonable doubt, the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors, and that the death penalty was appropriate since the sentence was not excessive or disproportionate to the sentences imposed in similar cases.

That section prohibited political activity by officers or employees in the classified service. In reversing on appeal, the court ruled that, in a declaratory judgment action, the meaning and applicability of &sect; 124.57 could not be stipulated by counsel, but had to be resolved by the trial court. That is, whether &sect; 124.57 prohibited or sanctioned the simultaneous holding of the positions of chief building inspector and township trustee was a judicial question to be resolved by the evidence, and not subject to stipulation. Moreover, the language of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3599.03 regarding what was included in the term &quot;partisan political purpose&quot; was to be read in para materia with Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Bowling Green Municipal Court (Ohio), which convicted him of speeding in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.21 and impounded his certificate of registration, registration plates, and suspended his driver's license for 90 days. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred when it required him to appear after being cited for a speeding violation (minor misdemeanor).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with speeding. The traffic ticket contained no specification of any prior moving violation within a 12 month period. On defendant's appearance before the Traffic Violations Bureau, he was not permitted to pay the fine and costs but was notified that he had to appear before the trial court because he had previously been convicted of a moving traffic offense within a 12 month period. When he appeared before the trial court, it imposed a fine of $ 50 and costs and, on his failure to produce proof of financial responsibility at the time of the offense pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101(B)(1), ordered the impoundment of his certificate of registration, registration plates, and suspended his driver's license for 90 days. On appeal, the court found that because defendant could not sign a plea of guilty due to the required certification of not having any prior moving traffic offenses within 12 months, the Traffic Violations Bureau has no alternative but to require his appearance in court. Therefore, the court found that for Ohio Traffic R. 13(B) to apply, there did not need not be a specification of a second moving violation charged on the ticket.</SPAN></P>

The accomplice and defendant were implicated in the murder of an Ohio police officer, and defendant was arrested. The Wyoming police obtained a confession from defendant and searched his hotel room. Ohio police also searched defendant's bedroom. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress his confession and the evidence contained in the searches, and defendant was convicted of two counts of aggravated murder with specifications. On appeal, he challenged the search of his bedroom. The court, however, held that defendant's mother retained ownership and possession of the bedroom, so she validly consented to the search. The court rejected defendant's challenge to the admissibility of the confession, holding that a Wyoming law that provided additional protection to juveniles did not apply because defendant was not considered a juvenile in the forum state of Ohio. The court also held that the prosecution's challenge for cause of death penalty opposed jurors did not deprive defendant of a trial by a jury representative of a cross-section of the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant neighbor sought review of a judgment from a Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which directed a verdict in favor of appellees--a city, a police officer, and mothers--in the neighbor's suit for malicious prosecution, false arrest, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mothers and the neighbor were involved in a dispute over the mother's children. The mothers contacted a police officer, who observed the neighbor's behavior regarding the children. The neighbor was arrested for making a false police report, but the charge was later dropped. She filed suit against appellants for malicious prosecution, false arrest, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court directed a verdict in favor of appellees. Upon review the court affirmed, with the exception of the claim for malicious prosecution against the police officer and the city, and for the civil rights violation claim against the police officer. The court held that the police officer, in the scope of his employment, initiated the judicial proceedings against the neighbor, and whether he did so maliciously and/or without probable cause were issues for the trier of fact. The court determined that whether the actions of the police officer violated the neighbor's civil rights was also an issue for the trier of the facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment as to the mothers on all claims, and as to the city and the police officer on the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and as to the city on the civil rights cause of action. The court reversed the judgment as to the police officer and the city for malicious prosecution, and as to the police officer for the civil rights violation.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 3319.16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher was arrested on two charges of public indecency. The board of education adopted a resolution declaring its intent to terminate his teaching contract, pursuant to &sect; 3319.16. A hearing was held before a referee, who found that the public indecency did in fact occur and that such conduct constituted immorality as that word was used in &sect; 3319.16. The board of education reviewed the referee's recommendation and terminated the teacher's contract. The teacher appealed. The appellate court affirmed. The court held that there was no constitutional defect in &sect; 3319.16 because a person of ordinary intelligence would have known that one act of public indecency could put his teaching contract in jeopardy. The court found no error in the trial court's conclusion that the board of education's decision to terminate the teacher's contract was supported by the manifest weight of the evidence. The board of education was not required to prove that the immoral conduct was job-related; the effect of the immorality on the teacher's job was a determination for the referee and the board of education.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of robbery and receiving stolen property in violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery and receiving stolen property in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.02 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.51. Defendant sought review and contended that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion to suppress evidence because his arrest and search were unconstitutional. Defendant, a retail employee, was detained by his employer's private security personnel after they received reports that he had stolen merchandise. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.041, the employer or its agent was permitted to detain defendant for a reasonable length of time because it had probable cause that defendant had committed a crime. The court found that the constitutional right against unreasonable searches applied only to actions by the government and its officers and not to acts of private individuals. The court determined that the search of defendant by the employer and its security personnel was not a governmental action. The court held that the action was not unconstitutional and further found that the exclusionary rule was inapplicable to the search. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
