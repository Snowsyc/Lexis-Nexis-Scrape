<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Order of the Supreme Court, Westchester County, dated December 30, 1976, affirmed, without costs or disbursements.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner board brought a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7503(b) to stay arbitration respondent union sought to invoke as a provision of its collective bargaining contract, which had provided for a five percent salary increase and periodic additional payments. The board sought review of the judgment of the Supreme Court, Westchester County, which granted the union's cross-motion to compel arbitration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union failed to receive the salary increases for which it had contracted with the board because the legislature adopted the Financial Emergency Act for the City of Yonkers (FEA), N.Y. Laws, ch. 871 (1975), which suspended all salary increases of covered organizations. The union asserted that the wage freeze violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, the constitutional ban of any state to impair the obligation of contracts. The court found that there was no impairment of the collective bargaining agreement, only a temporary suspension of increases. The union asserted the FEA violated equal protection by leaving unimpaired the contract rights of other contractors with the city, but the court found no taking of or deprivation of property, only a suspension of the wage increase payment. The court found no basis in the language of the arbitration provisions of the collective bargaining agreement for granting a stay of arbitration because although the statutory ban precluded an arbitrator from fashioning a remedy violative of the statute, it allowed the arbitration to address other issues. Further, the wage freeze was not unconstitutional, as it was a valid exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court to compel arbitration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- emergency suspension of municipal employee wage increases -- arbitrability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 10 of the Financial Emergency Act for the City of Yonkers (L 1975, ch 871), which suspended all salary and wage increases of city employees taking effect after November 20, 1975, is constitutional, except insofar as it prohibits calculation of pension benefits based upon the suspended increases.  The impairment of contract clause of the Constitution is qualified by the power of the States to maintain order and protect the public welfare, and there is no impairment, but only a suspension. There is no deprivation of due process, since the suspension is a proper exercise of the police power, and there is no deprivation of equal protection, since the distinction between public employees and other municipal creditors is a rational classification&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  based upon the flexibility of the employment relationship.  There is no deprivation of property without due process of law, since the wage increase is suspended instead of eliminated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent public employee union is entitled to arbitrate its grievance arising from the refusal of petitioner board of education pursuant to the Financial Emergency Act to pay wage increases, increments and longevity payments under a collective bargaining agreement between the parties.  The agreement limits arbitrable grievances to claimed violations, misinterpretations or inequitable applications of the agreement, laws and rules of the board, which terms exclude an action reviewable by law.  Express denial of grievance status in certain instances indicates that not all grievances reviewable by law are exempt from arbitration, and if every grievance reviewable by law were exempt, the arbitration provision would be illusory, since almost any grievance is reviewable in an action on contract or in an article 78 proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The arbitrator may fashion a remedy appropriate to the circumstances, preserving the pension rights of respondents and dealing with any rights respondents might have to a restoration&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of increases after suspension, but not conflicting with the ban on payment of increases during the emergency period.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Judgment of the Supreme Court, Nassau County, entered April 5, 1973, modified, on the law, by (1) deleting the first decretal paragraph thereof, (2) deleting from the second decretal paragraph thereof the provision dismissing the petition in all respects and substituting therefor provisions (a) granting the petition to the extent of dismissing Specification 3 of Charge 1 and Specification 2 of Charge 2 and (b) reducing the penalty imposed upon the remaining charges to a suspension for a period of one year.  As so modified, judgment affirmed, without costs or disbursements, and proceeding remanded to Special Term for a hearing to (1) determine the outside time limit within which petitioner could reasonably have been expected to perfect his appeal and (2) fix the amount of back pay due him, in accordance with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Per Curiam</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opinion herein.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, an accounting executive with the Nassau County Department of Social Services, instituted a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 to review the determination of respondent Nassau County Civil Service Commission. The Supreme Court at Special Term, Nassau County (New York) granted the commission's motion to dismiss the proceeding and the executive appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executive was dismissed from his position on the basis of misconduct and insubordination and dereliction of duty. The executive appealed to the commission pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 76, and the commission sustained the dismissal. The court determined that the commission's actions in sustaining the charges were purely arbitrary and that the penalty of dismissal was so disproportionate to the offense as to shock the court's sense of fairness. Accordingly, the court reduced the penalty to a one-year suspension, with an amount of back pay to be determined upon remand. The court held that the executive did not let his personal convictions interfere with the good faith performance of his duties and the record indicated that he sought guidance and legal advice on the issue of whether intrauterine devices were abortifacients. The was remanded to the trial court for a hearing to determine an outside time limit within which the executive could have reasonably been expected to perfect his appeal and to determine the compensation, in the form of back pay, to which the executive was entitled during that period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's judgment by reducing the penalty imposed on the executive to a one-year suspension and otherwise affirmed. The court remanded to the trial court to determine the outside time limit within which the executive could reasonably have been expected to perfect his appeal and to fix the amount of back pay due him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- dismissal -- misconduct and insubordination -- penalties -- back pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Nassau County Civil&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Service Commission arbitrarily sustained charges of misconduct against petitioner arising from a memorandum he issued as accounting executive of the Nassau County Department of Social Services ordering deletion from State and Federal reimbursement of the salaries of county medical center personnel who were making referrals of elective abortions. The memorandum was at most an overzealous application of the law as it stood at that time and the matter was dropped without harm to the department when overridden by petitioner's superior officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although a finding of insubordination based upon petitioner's refusal to certify claims for reimbursement for expenditures for intrauterine devices (IUDs) was not arbitrary, the penalty should be a one-year suspension and not dismissal.  The court has the right to set aside administrative disciplinary rulings which are so disproportionate to the offense as to shock one's sense of fairness, and petitioner's injudicious actions do not merit dismissal.  Although petitioner had raised a proper question concerning reimbursability of county expenses for IUDs in light of respected medical opinion that the devices are abortive in nature, instead of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  receiving an answer based upon law or policy, he was orally instructed to certify the claims.  Petitioner had an excellent record and the county ultimately received reimbursement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Accordingly, petitioner should receive back pay from the day following completion of one year of suspension. However, since petitioner's appeal should expeditiously have been heard prior to the close of the 1973 term of court, back pay should be paid only to that date, unless extenuating circumstances are found excusing the delay.  </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 3102(f), in plaintiff trustee's action to have the Tidal Wetlands Act declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee owned over 500 acres of land on behalf of several trusts. The uses to which the land could be put were drastically limited by the Tidal Wetlands Act (Act), N.Y. Envt'l Conserv. Law art. 25. The county commenced a condemnation proceeding and title to the land has vested in the county. The trustee then brought the instant action seeking a declaration that the Act violated its federal constitutional rights. The trustee sought to compel defendants to submit to disclosure, but the supreme court held that a motion made under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3102(f) did not require the production of documents or permit any specific type of disclosure, and that an order entered pursuant to that section merely permitted the trustee to utilize the disclosure devices provided for in N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 31. The court concluded that the statute's usual meaning indicated that the trustee had to apply to the supreme court for an order permitting disclosure because the state was a defendant. The court modified the order to require defendants to submit to oral depositions as to the manner in which the Act would be applied and the nature of defendants' roles in condemning the land, and otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the supreme court's order to the extent that defendants would submit to depositions upon oral examination as to the manner in which the Act had been and would be applied and the nature and evolution of defendants' roles in financing and otherwise participating in the condemnation of the land. As so modified, the court affirmed the supreme court's order.</SPAN></P>

The landowners also sought to enjoin the operation of the gravel bank. The supreme court dismissed both causes of action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, New York City Conciliation and Appeals Board (CAB) and the landlord, sought review of the judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Queens County (New York), which remanded, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78, the grant of a comparative hardship rent increase to the CAB for further hearings to afford respondent tenants an opportunity to examine the landlord's books at the tenants' expense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord purchased the 20-building complex in 1969. In 1975, the landlord requested a comparative hardship rate increase from the CAB. The landlord offered reports certified by independent CPAs. The tenants requested to inspect the landlord's books but the CAB denied the request The tenants objected that a rent increase should not be retroactive to the filing date because of the landlord's unresponsiveness. The CAB granted the landlord a comparative hardship increase under the New York City Rent Stabilization Law, New York City, N.Y. Admin. Code tit. YY, &sect; 51 (1969), effective the date of filing. The tenants brought a petition in the trial court, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78, challenging the increase. The trial court granted the petition, averring that the tenants risked valuable property rights in the hearing and remanding the case to the CAB to permit the tenants, at their expense, to examine the books. On appeal, the court held that the tenants had no constitutional property rights against increased rents; however, the CAB had to conduct a meaningful review of the application, including an independent financial inspect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which remanded the case to the CAB to permit the tenants to review, at their own expense, the landlords' books to determined whether the comparative hardship rent increase was proper. The court also directed that the escrow for future rents be continued until the conclusion of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Although the New York City Conciliation and Appeals Board (CAB) is funded by owners of real property through the Real Estate Industry Association, it is statutorily empowered to hear complaints by tenants and requests by landlords for hardship rental increases under the New York City Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 (Administrative Code, tit YY, ch 51) and its members are appointed by the Mayor.  Notwithstanding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that tenants have no constitutional, vested property rights against rent increases, the board must conduct a meaningful review of owner applications and cannot subdelegate its functions.  Accordingly, upon an application for a hardship rental increase it was improper for the CAB to accept the findings of certified public accountants retained by the respondent landlord with regard to base period rents and expenses, subject only to any contrary information which might be supplied by the petitioner tenants, while simultaneously refusing the tenants the right to audit the landlord's accounts.  An audit should have been conducted by the CAB or a tenant audit should have been permitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the determination of the CAB accepting the base period supplied by respondent landlord was properly remanded, because made without benefit of an independent audit, the determination would otherwise be entitled to controlling weight because made by the agency administering the Rent Stabilization Law. The determination was rationally and consistently made upon evidence that the owner could not obtain records of periods prior to its taking title and, accordingly, could not utilize the statutory&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  base period in full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The CAB is a city housing rent agency under section 8 of the Local Emergency Housing Rent Control Act (L 1962, ch 21, &sect; 1) and, accordingly, is entitled under CPLR 5519 to a stay of the judgment made by Special Term remanding the agency's determination.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding, petitioner permit applicant's agent (applicant) challenged the determination of respondent zoning board of appeals (board), which denied a special use permit to the applicant to continue the former operations of a race track that the applicant intended to purchase. The applicant also sought a declaration that respondent town's comprehensive zoning ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certain land within the town was formerly used as a race track, but its stock car races had been terminated for several years. After its closure, a number of residences and a commercial development were built adjacent to the track. The applicant sought to purchase this property and once again utilize it as a stock car race track. The board denied the applicant a special use permit to continue the former operations, and the court confirmed the board's determination. The court held that stock car racing was not an activity that was expressly permitted by the town's ordinance; thus, the board's refusal to grant the special use permit was proper. The denial of prior non-conforming use status was also proper because the race track had not been in continuous operation for a long time, nor was it at the time that the ordinance was enacted. The applicant was not entitled to a variance because it failed to demonstrate that the property in question could not be reasonably employed in conformity with the relevant zoning regulations. Further, a reasonable return to the agent could be obtained from permitted uses and a mere lessening of profits did not render the ordinance confiscatory.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An application by petitioners for site plan approval or a special use permit to continue a stock car race track formerly operated on certain property was properly denied.  Since the proposed use had nothing to do with housing or the enjoyment of mountain land, stock car racing would not be permitted under the provisions of the town zoning ordinance. The terms &quot;Park, reservation and/or recreation facility&quot; found in the ordinance must be interpreted in their most obvious sense and an examination of the ordinance reveals a legislative intent that the terms apply only to noncommercial parks and recreational facilities. Moreover, a commonsense evaluation of the wording is enough to exclude a stock&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  car race track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The denial of prior nonconforming use status was proper as the race track had not been in continuous operation.  The evidence established an intent to abandon the use as a speedway nine years prior to the adoption of the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioners are not entitled to a variance for they failed to demonstrate that the property could not be reasonably employed in conformity with the zoning regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The zoning ordinance is not unconstitutional.  There is no unlawful delegation to respondent.  Standards and guidelines are clearly expressed in the ordinance. A reasonable return to petitioners may be obtained from permitted uses and a mere lessening of profits does not render the ordinance confiscatory. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner father sought review of a decision from the Family Court (New York) that dismissed his request to direct respondent mother to contribute to the child's support.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father sought to receive child support from the mother for their infant son, who was in the father's custody. The lower court dismissed the father's request but, on appeal, the court reversed the decision and ordered the cause to be remanded. The court had to determine whether &sect;&sect; 413 and 414 of the Family Court Act were unconstitutional insofar as they appeared to place the primary duty of child support on the father and made the mother's duty of support of the child secondary by making that obligation conditional on the incapability of the father to support the child. The court read the two sections as meaning that both the father and the mother were equally responsible for the support of the child and that it was within the power of the Family Court to apportion the costs of support between them in accordance with their respective means and responsibilities, without regard to the parent's sex. It followed that the lower court was in error when it read the two sections as barring it from apportioning part of the cost of support to the mother unless the father could establish that he was incapable of supporting his child, a condition which he conceded he could not meet.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the proceeding to the lower court for a determination by it of the needs of the child of the parties and for the proper apportionment thereof between the parties, consistent with their respective means. The court found that support was to be provided to the infant equally between the father and the mother and it was the duty of the lower court to apportion the costs of such support between them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under sections 413 and 414 of the Family Court Act, the father and the mother of a child are equally responsible for its support, and the Family Court has the power, and the duty, to apportion the costs of such support between them in accordance with their respective means and responsibilities, without regard to the sex of the parent, even when it appears that the father is fully capable of supporting the child out of his own means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

The court may apportion the costs of the support of the child between the parents according to their respective means and responsibilities&quot;.  The opening language of section 414 does not mean that the mother becomes liable for contribution to the support of the child only if the father is dead, incapable of supporting the child or cannot be found within the State.  And, if the section were susceptible to an interpretation that the mother's obligation is a secondary one, which would result&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in unequal treatment of the parents on the basis of their sex, in violation of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection, its opening language may be excised in order to sustain its constitutionality.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter before the court concerned the sale of certain property. The first purchaser obtained a judgment of foreclosure and sale against the second owner. The second owner failed to redeem any of the purchased tax liens. The court determined that the second owner's tax sale certificate was the result of a private lien. The court stated that municipal tax sales provided for by statute were in essence budgetary provisions that enabled the respective municipality to realize by sale of tax sale certificates the uncollected taxes for the year involved and thereby carry out budgetary expenditures and protect municipal borrowing credit. The court held such purpose should not be frustrated by permitting municipal liens to be extinguished when the property was conveyed by the municipality to the holder of a tax sale certificate.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A conveyance of real property by the county to the plaintiff holders of a tax sale certificate purchased four years earlier extinguishes the interest of defendant, a subsequent purchaser of a village tax certificate on the subject property, since section 1020 of the Real Property Tax Law&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., provides that a county conveyance vests in the grantee an absolute estate in fee, subject only to county and State encumbrances, actual occupancy and recorded mortgages.  It is irrelevant that defendant's certificate had been owned previously by the village, since it is still a private lien.  Accordingly, summary judgment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  should have been granted to plaintiffs in their action to clear title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Special Term properly denied summary relief to plaintiffs and granted such relief to the defendant village on its cross motion with regard to a tax certificate held by the village. Although section 1020 of the Real Property Tax Law subjects a county conveyance only to county and State encumbrances, it does not follow that village encumbrances are extinguished. Tax sales provide a salutary scheme for payment of municipal taxes and that scheme should not be frustrated by permitting municipal liens to be extinguished.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first confessed to burglary of a building. After being taken some distance from his home by officers and undergoing an intermittent but intense interrogation over a period of more than 12 hours, defendant confessed to intentionally starting a fire that killed 24 people.

The court reversed the conviction, vacated the guilty plea, and granted the motion to suppress some of the statements. The court considered the totality of the circumstances and found: (1) defendant's faculties were impaired; (2) he was physically separated from familiar surroundings; (3) the interrogation was lengthy and intense; (4) arraignment was delayed; (5) the evening polygraphic examination was misused; (6) officers' false statements and threats impaired defendant's capacity for self-determination; and (7) the questioning was suggestive.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution for murder in the second degree, arson in the second degree, burglary in the second degree and petit larceny, the People have not sustained their burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that statements made by defendant during and immediately after an evening interrogation were voluntarily made.  Defendant had slept only three hours the night before and had requested that a polygraph examination held earlier in the day be terminated because he felt ill.  Defendant had eaten only lunch from 6:00 a.m. until 10:30 p.m., &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  when he was delivered to the jail, and was under severe emotional stress, as evidenced by his repeated crying.  The interrogating officers arranged for a place for examination far from defendant's home and questioned him intermittently, but intensely, for over a 12-hour period, repeatedly telling him that &quot;the professionals&quot; could not accept his story, that he was lying and that he had &quot;torched that place&quot;.  In view of a statement defendant made earlier in the day, it is clear that he would not have been free to leave.  Nevertheless, no arrest was made and, although there was technical compliance with the State of Connecticut's arraignment statute, it appears that arraignment was delayed.  The polygraph was misused to extract defendant's confession when defendant was told that the examiner was there to help him, that the machine was infallible and that only the guilty wished the attachments removed.  False statements and threats served to overbear defendant's will.  He was told that he would be thrown through a window for failing to look at his interrogator, that his bail would be raised and he would be shipped to New York State, but that, if he stated that he used chemicals to &quot;torch&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the building, there would be no murder charges.  The suggestiveness of the questioning rendered the statements inherently unreliable.  After intense questioning, defendant was told that he had lit a piece of paper with a match and he then simply agreed or parroted what he had been told to say.  The totality of the circumstances renders the statements inadmissible, while statements made earlier in the day were admissible.</SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 78 to review a determination of respondents, the Public Health Council and others, which revoked her approval of establishment of a nursing home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nursing home owner's approval for the establishment of a nursing was revoked. She challenged this, contending that the grant of power to the Public Health Council in N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2801-a(10)(a) was unconstitutional because of a failure to incorporate legislative standards therein. The court disagreed, finding that statute did enunciate certain standards which had to be applied in granting a license and that these standards governed as guidelines and standards for the revocation of the prior approval of an establishment, including the limitations inherent in N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2800 as they related to the continuance of a prior approval. The court found that there had not been an unconstitutional delegation of power to the council in regard to providing for the revocation of approval of an establishment. Further, since the regulation did not mandate a revocation upon a conviction and was discretionary, the court found that it authorized a revocation unless the conviction undermined the standards relating to the original issuance of an approval and in conjunction with the guidelines set forth in N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2800.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After petitioner, who held an approval from the Public Health Council to establish a nursing home, pleaded guilty to offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree, a felony, based upon transactions involving the Medicaid reimbursement forms utilized in the nursing home operation, and following a hearing at which careful consideration was given to all of the proof, including those matters which would relate to the effect of her conviction in terms of the standards which would be applicable in granting an approval for an establishment, the council revoked her approval.  Its determination was supported by substantial evidence, and it is confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 10 of section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2801-a of the Public Health Law, authorizing the council to adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the provisions of that section, which relates to establishment of hospitals, including nursing homes, and requires the council's approval before establishment thereof, and authorizing it to provide for the revocation, limitation or annulment of approvals, is not unconstitutional for failure to incorporate legislative standards therein.  In subdivision 3 of the section, certain standards are enunciated which must be applied in granting an approval, and these same standards, by any reasonable interpretation of the powers granted, including the adoption of rules and regulations, would govern as standards for the revocation of a prior approval, including the limitations inherent in section 2800 of the law as they relate to continuance of a prior approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Pursuant to the authority granted in section 2801-a (subd 10, par [a]) of the Public Health Law, the council has adopted a regulation providing that an approval of establishment &quot;may&quot; be revoked if the council finds that the established operator has been convicted of a &quot;crime&quot; (10 NYCRR 600.5 [e]).  Viewed literally, this regulation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would appear to exceed the implicit statutory guidelines by permitting a revocation simply upon proof of conviction of a crime, which language would include both misdemeanors and felonies and might factually have no substantial bearing upon the continuation of a prior approval. However, since it does not mandate revocation but is discretionary, it is not found to authorize a revocation unless the conviction undermines the standards for approval of an establishment, to which standards all the grounds for revocation must be related.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The fact that petitioner received a certificate of relief from disabilities does not prevent the council from exercising its power to revoke her approval.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state governor and associated individuals, sought review of an order from the Supreme Court, Onondaga County (New York), which denied appellants' motion to dismiss the petition filed by respondents, County Executive and Chief Budget Officer and district attorney, in a case concerning the validity of an executive order that directed the county to pay the costs of an investigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents initiated a proceeding against appellants and sought to enjoin appellants from proceeding with an investigation into the alleged unlawful acts of persons within the county. Respondents specifically challenged the validity of the executive order which provided that the county was to pay the expenses of the investigation and that removed the county district attorney from office. The lower court denied appellants' motion to dismiss and appellants sought review. The court reversed the lower court order and granted appellants' motion to dismiss on the ground that no justifiable issue existed for trial. The court determined that the executive order was legal and valid because the governor invoked his power to order the investigation and the governor's exercise of his executive power was not subject to judicial review.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Governor -- directive to Attorney-General to investigate unlawful acts -- superseding District Attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Executive Orders Nos. 42 and 42.1 issued by the Governor directing the Attorney-General to investigate alleged unlawful acts of persons in Onondaga County with respect to payments in connection with obtaining public office or contracts, and suspending the District Attorney of that county are legal and valid and not subject to attack.  Section 3 of article IV of the State Constitution charges the Governor with the duty to &quot;take care that the laws are faithfully executed&quot; and the Legislature has expressly implemented that provision by enacting subdivision 2 of section 63 of the Executive Law requiring the Attorney-General to conduct such proceedings before a Supreme Court and Grand Jury as the Governor shall direct concerning&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the investigation of criminal activities and to supersede the District Attorney in so doing.  By the terms of the orders, the Governor invoked his powers on information received from a Grand Jury and the District Attorney of New York County.  The Governor stated the basis for his action in Executive Order No. 42 and the exercise of his discretion is not subject to judicial review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The enactment of article 16-A of the Election Law, transferring to the State Board of Elections the former authority of the Attorney-General to investigate election frauds, was not designed to and did not release the Governor from the duty imposed on him by the Constitution.  Moreover, the Legislature did not repeal subdivision 2 of section 63 of the Executive Law.  The Governor's authority is all embracing and Order No. 42 may contemplate broader action than that envisaged under article 16-A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The application to limit the bills for expenses which may be presented to Onondaga County in connection with the investigation is premature. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The committee's rules provided for the election of two members per election district, with no additional members. The committee's rules also provided for weighted voting only in selecting party nominees but not with regard to its voting on &quot;internal&quot; party matters. The court noted that N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 12(1) required such weighted voting without excepting any category or subject matter in county committees. The committee argued that the statute was unconstitutional. The court held that the method of apportionment established by N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 12(1) did not violate the constitution. The legislature was empowered to act upon the assumption that the proportionate party vote for a public office in various election districts within a county had a sufficiently substantial and direct mathematical relationship to the proportionate party enrollment in the various election districts so as to provide a satisfactory formula for weighing the votes of committee members. Accordingly, the order directing the committee to amend their rules was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- county committees -- voting power of committee members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A county committee was properly directed to amend its rules so as to provide for a system of weighted voting on all voting matters before it, including voting on internal party matters as well as selecting party nominees. Its rules provide for the election of two committee members per election district, with no additional members, and, under section 12 (subd 1) of the Election Law, where no additional members are provided for by the rules of the committee, the voting power of each member shall be in proportion to the party vote in the district for Governor or, in specified situations, for certain other elective officers.  That section makes no distinction between selection of party nominees and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  internal party affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 12 (subd 1) of the Election Law is constitutional.  Reasonable legislation regulating party committees is valid, and, while it may be that the &quot;one man, one vote&quot; principle need not be applied to internal party matters, there is nothing to indicate that it may not be properly applied to such matters.  Nor does the section work an unconstitutional disenfranchisement of enrolled party members in basing the weighted voting system upon the vote for elective office rather than upon actual party enrollment. While apportionment by party enrollment may be preferable, this does not mean that the scheme as enacted by the Legislature is without rational basis.  It is empowered to act upon the assumption that the proportionate party vote for a public office in various election districts within a county bears a sufficiently substantial and direct mathematical relationship to the proportionate party enrollment in the various districts so as to provide a satisfactory formula for weighing the votes of committee members.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after his guilty plea to sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and sentenced to an indeterminate term of six years to life in prison. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the trial court questioned defendant thoroughly and was satisfied that he fully understood the consequences of pleading guilty. The court ruled that defendant's disagreement with the prosecutor's outline of his involvement in the crimes did not require the trial court to question him extensively about the facts because defendant was represented by competent counsel and admitted that his plea was to his benefit by minimizing his potential sentence. The court found that defendant waived his challenge to the composition of the jury panel when he waived his right to a jury trial, and that he had ample time to examine the jury list, but chose to plead guilty to the lesser offense instead. The court concluded that the sentencing statutes under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from an order and judgment of the Supreme Court in New York County (New York), which granted a motion by defendants for summary judgment dismissing the class action complaint brought by plaintiffs to enjoin enforcement of a local law requiring financial disclosure by city employees earning a salary of $ 25,000 or more.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs occupied positions in the civil service of New York City. The lower court upheld the constitutionality of the law. Plaintiffs contended that the legislation infringed upon their right of privacy in their financial and marital relationships and had a chilling effect upon their right of association, belief and expression. Plaintiffs argued that these were fundamental rights under the Constitution, so the legislation should be examined with strict scrutiny. Plaintiffs further claimed that there was no rational basis for distinguishing between employees earning $ 25,000 or more and those earning less than $ 25,000 and that the law was vague and ambiguous. The court concluded that the law's provision for disclosure of the financial statements without affording the employee the opportunity to present a claim for privacy should be stricken and that disclosure not be made public absent the implementation of such safeguards as were consistent with due process. Thus, the court modified the judgment by declaring unconstitutional the provision of the law that the information furnished was to be made available to the public and otherwise held that the law was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- financial disclosure by public employees -- right of privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Local Law No. 1 of 1975 of the City of New York requiring every city employee earning a salary of $ 25,000 or more to file an annual questionnaire disclosing the financial affairs of the employee and his or her spouse relating to outside sources of income is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not constitutionally offensive when the rights and interests of city employees, as citizens, are balanced against the rights and interests of the city, as employer.  The requirement of disclosure by spouses is not violative of a right of privacy and the requirement that those earning $ 25,000 or more disclose their affairs, without any showing that those persons exercised discretion or performed management functions, does not constitute a constitutionally impermissible classification, since that classification has a rational basis. (See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Evans v Carey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 40 NY2d 1008.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. However, public employees do not surrender their constitutional right to due process.  Deprivation of liberty is entitled to the protection of due process and privacy is a right within the concept of liberty.  Insofar as Local Law No. 1 requires that the detailed disclosure be made available to the public, it is invalid.  There is an insensitivity to rights of privacy and a disregard of claims of irrelevancy. Accordingly, the provision in Local Law No. 1 for disclosure of the financial statements without affording employees the opportunity to present a claim for privacy should be stricken and disclosure should&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not be made public absent the implementation of such safeguards as are consistent with due process. </SPAN></P>

The court noted that a corporation could be doing sufficient business to subject it to service of process, but not enough to require it to obtain a license under &sect; 1312. The court remanded for a factual determination of whether the franchisee was &quot;doing business&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 1312.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court order which denied the franchisee's motion for a preliminary injunction against the former franchisor. The court also reversed the order which dismissed the franchisee's complaint for failure to comply with the New York Business Corporation Law, and remanded for a hearing in the issue of that compliance.</SPAN></P>

Lien Law &sect; 62.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lienor filed a motion to intervene in a mechanics' lien action as a subsequent lienor and a party defendant under &sect; 62. &sect; 62 provided, inter alia, that, upon good cause shown, the court was required to order a lienor who had filed a notice of lien after the commencement of an action to foreclose or enforce a mechanics' lien to be brought in by amendment. On appeal from an order granting the motion, appellants claimed that &sect; 62 was violated due process of law, arguing that the failure of &sect; 62 to specifically provide for service of responsive pleadings and for the conducting of pretrial disclosure inherently prejudiced the landowner. The court affirmed, noting, inter alia, that appellants' contention that &sect; 62 was unconstitutional was insufficient to overcome the presumption of constitutionality. Further, the trial court, under &sect; 62, retained sufficient control of the action to frustrate appellants' abstract claim that &sect;62 was violative on its face of due process. Moreover, appellants were afforded an opportunity by the trial court to obtain disclosure with respect to respondent. Appellants were granted leave to apply to the trial court for the time to conduct such disclosure.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the state appellate court reversed his conviction, finding that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial suppression motion. The court held that appellant's motion should have been granted since he was stopped unconstitutionally. The court noted that appellant was within a block and a half of the robbery situs well after the robbery was committed, whereas it was likely the perpetrator would have been long gone by the time police arrived on the scene. The court also noted that his physical appearance did not match the description provided of the assailant and that he gave no indication that he was armed and presently dangerous when he was stopped.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent motor vehicles department commissioner established regulations, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 15, &sect; 170.2(a), permitting the doubling of the normal license fee for license renewal to those drivers who had one or two convictions or bail forfeitures within the 36-month period preceding the stated expiration date of the driver's license being renewed. Petitioner drivers objected to the fee. The reviewing court found that the regulations were unconstitutional. The legislature retained the authority to fix fees for the issuance of licenses. This was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power that violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, because the legislature did not furnish the agency with rules and principles to guide its exercise of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two decisions finding that the state driver safety assessment fee regulations were invalid were affirmed and modified because the regulations were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor vehicles -- increased fee for renewal license -- funding for driver improvement program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapter 50 of the Laws of 1976 appropriated funds for a driver improvement program and provided that expenditures from that appropriation were to be reimbursed by receipts from fees established by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles sufficient to cover the cost of operating the program.  Pursuant to that enactment, the commissioner promulgated regulations permitting the doubling of the normal license fee for license renewals to those drivers who have had one or two convictions or bail forfeitures within the 36-month period preceding the renewal. While the money was appropriated and the commissioner was authorized to set fees, the program was never instituted and such ambiguity is violative of section 1 of article III of the New York Constitution which provides that the legislative power of the State is vested in the Senate and the Assembly. The statute neither sets bounds to the delegated authority, nor formulates standards to govern the administrative exercise of the delegated discretion.  The statute does not define what the driver improvement program&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is and thus leaves to the commissioner's sole discretion the determination of what activities are encompassed in the program.  Such unfettered discretion in an area otherwise characterized by explicit legislation with respect to license fees and other charges stamps the subject legislation as an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.  Accordingly, so much of chapter 50 as authorized the commissioner to establish fees sufficient to cover the cost of the driver improvement program was unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state sought review of a judgment by the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which granted summary judgment to defendant landowners on the state's action to enjoin the landowners from selling or offering for sale any lot on the land they purchased until a subdivision plan was approved.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought (1) to enjoin the landowners from selling any part of their land or erecting a permanent building upon their land until a subdivision plan was approved; (2) an assessment of civil penalties against the landowners pursuant to N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect;&sect; 17-1705,1707 and N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect;&sect; 12, 1116; and (3) to require the landowners to abate an alleged public nuisance. The trial court granted summary judgment to the landowners on all except the nuisance claim. On appeal, the court affirmed, but modified the judgment by reversing the grant of summary judgment to the state on its public nuisance claim. The court concurred with the trial court that N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect;&sect; 17-1705,1707 and N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect;&sect; 12, 1116 were so vague and indefinite that they were unconstitutional. The court found it would often be impossible for a person who wished to sell portions of his property to determine with any degree of certainty whether or not he would be creating a subdivision and had to comply with the statutes. Lastly, the court ruled that triable issues of fact existed as to whether the landowner' septic system was actually malfunctioning.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Special Term properly granted summary judgment to defendant sellers of land declaring sections 1115 and 1116 of the Public Health Law and section 17-1505 of the Environmental Conservation Law&nbsp;unconstitutional.  The statutes require subdivision plans to be filed with the Department of Health for sale of &quot;any tract of land which is hereafter divided into five or more parcels along an existing or proposed street * * * for sale or for rent as residential lots&quot;.  Absent any definition of &quot;tract&quot;, &quot;parcel&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or &quot;residential lots&quot;, it would be impossible for a seller to determine if his sale constitutes a subdivision in such instances as sales from contiguous lands acquired under separate deeds or sales of portions of a parcel over a long period of time where each purchaser constructs a residence.  Since the term &quot;subdivision&quot; is not sufficiently definite to warn &quot;men of common intelligence&quot; of the application of the enactments, the statutes are unconstitutional and the causes of action enjoining further sale, directing compliance and assessing civil penalties were properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appeared before a grand jury and was granted transactional immunity. Defendant inquired if the grand jury questions to have been asked were based on evidence acquired through electronic surveillance. After the state answered in the affirmative, defendant's motion for a full suppression hearing was denied. Defendant then answered the grand jury questions &quot;under protest.&quot; On the basis of defendant's grand jury testimony, he was indicted on the charge of criminal contempt in the first degree in violation of &sect; 215.51. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress his grand jury testimony and convicted defendant upon the jury verdict of criminal contempt in the first degree. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, granted defendant's motion to suppress, and dismissed the indictment. The court held in part that defendant was entitled to have had his testimony suppressed and the indictment dismissed, as the grand jury questioning was the product of improper electronic surveillance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's conviction of defendant for criminal contempt in the first degree, granted defendant's motion to suppress his grand jury testimony, and dismissed the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Contempt -- criminal contempt -- questions based on illegal electronic surveillance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A Grand Jury witness who has been indicted for criminal contempt based on alleged equivocal, evasive and patently false answers may have such testimony suppressed and the indictment dismissed on the ground that the questioning was the product of improper electronic surveillance. The New York eavesdropping statutes were intended to harmonize State law with Federal law and section 2515 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (US Code, tit 18, &sect; 2515) has been viewed as an unequivocal bar to questioning a Grand Jury witness if the questions are derived from improper electronic surveillance. Accordingly, the contempt power may not be used to compel such testimony or punish the witness for his silence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2.  The decision of a Grand Jury witness to answer questions is not an independent intervening factor sufficient to dissipate the taint arising from the illegal eavesdropping which formed the basis for the questions and a witness who answers evasively may raise such eavesdropping as a defense to a contempt indictment. No distinction is served in contrasting contempt by evasion with contempt by a flat refusal to answer.  The indictment is based on both questions and answers and not answers alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  It was error to admit defendant's entire Grand Jury testimony at the trial for it included irrelevant matters.  Some effort at redaction should have been made.</SPAN></P>

Upon defendant's raising of his Fourth Amendment right at the Grand Jury proceeding, defendant was properly taken before the court which inspected the surveillance orders </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">in camera</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and directed defendant to answer.  Defendant was not entitled to a full suppression hearing in the course of the Grand Jury inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Accordingly, the judgment convicting defendant of criminal contempt in the first degree, after a hearing in which a motion to suppress defendant's Grand Jury testimony was denied, should be reversed, on the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  law, the motion should be granted and the indictment dismissed. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the county, the County Sealer of Weights and Measures, and the district attorney, appealed the judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Monroe County (New York), in favor of petitioner, owner of a gasoline service station, in the owner's action challenging the validity of the Monroe County, N.Y., 1975 Local Law No. 2, &sect;&sect; 1B4, 1B5 and the owner's petition to show cause and for a temporary restraining order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner filed a petition to show cause and for a temporary restraining order and a declaratory judgment action seeking to have the maximum sign restrictions in &sect;&sect; 1B4, 1B5 for advertising prices of gasoline and petroleum declared null and void and to permanently enjoin defendants from enforcing or attempting to enforce such provisions. Defendants filed motions to dismiss. The trial court denied defendants' motions and treated the owner's motion for an injunction as a motion for summary judgment as to the issues in the declaratory judgment action, which it granted. Defendants appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 1B4, 1B5 could not be justified by the county's power to regulate community aesthetics because such purpose was not mentioned as a legislative intent, and other types of service station advertisement were not regulated. Sections 1B5, 1B5 were unconstitutional because the size of the signs bore no reasonable or rational relationship to the deterrence of fraudulent practices. The owner also successfully demonstrated that he suffered substantial pecuniary loss from such provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in favor of the owner, which declared provisions of the Monroe County Local Laws restricting the maximum size of signs used to advertise the price of gasoline and petroleum products to be null and void, and which permanently enjoined defendants from enforcing or attempting to enforce such provisions. The court also held that the issues raised with regard to the show cause petition were moot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- regulation of gasoline price signs -- injunctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Monroe County Local Law No. 2 of 1975, to extent it attempts to regulate the number and maximum size of all gasoline price signs that a gasoline dealer is permitted to have in view other than those signs required to be affixed to individual gasoline pumps by said local law, fails in its avowed legislative purpose and is unconstitutional.  The constitutionality of the statute cannot be justified by the consideration of community aesthetics. Aside from the fact that the expressed legislative intent does not offer aesthetics as a reason for its enactment, the statute itself, by failing to regulate other types of service station advertisements, would be void on the ground of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arbitrariness.  Nor can the statute be justified as a deterrence of fraudulent practices, its stated legislative purpose, since restrictions on the size and number of such signs bear no reasonable or rational relationship to the deterrence of such practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. As to whether Special Term should have granted the District Attorney's motion to dismiss petitioner's preliminary injunction proceeding on the ground such relief was not authorized by law or whether the petitioner should have sought a writ of prohibition in order to enjoin the criminal action pending against him for a violation of Local Law No. 2, the fact remains that the temporary restraining order has by its very nature expired and has been superseded by the permanent injunction entered in petitioner's declaratory judgment action. Consequently, the validity of the grant of this order, together with petitioner's right to seek such relief, is for all intents and purposes rendered moot.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The club operator asserted that there was insufficient evidence to support the authority's suspension of his license and the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the authority's findings, holding that the ruling was supported by substantial evidence because 25 citizens testified that the noise generated from the club prevented them from sleeping, that the noise came from the music, from vehicles entering and leaving the premises, and from boisterous patrons. This testimony supported the determination that the club operator conducted its operations in such a manner that property owners in the area were repeatedly and regularly deprived of the quiet enjoyment of their homes. The club operator asserted that the statute provided no guidance as to what conduct was proscribed, was unconstitutionally vague, and that suspension of his license for a period of 30 days was an abuse of discretion. The court held that club operator failed to carry his burden of proof that the statute was void for vagueness, and that in light of the on-going nature of the violation, it could not be said that the period of suspension was shocking to the conscience or an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the patrolman was first convicted of conspiracy, the commissioner of police removed him from office pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 30(1)(e). The patrolman argued that conspiracy to commit bribery and grand larceny was not a crime involving a violation of his oath of office as a policeman. On appeal the court found that conspiracy to bribe was no less a violation of the oath of office than the acceptance or giving of the bribe itself and fell within the terms of the statute. Upon the patrolman's conviction his office was vacated immediately by operation of &sect; 30(1)(e), not as a matter of punishment to him, but because the term of office was limited by statute and terminated upon the happening of the event. The subsequent reversal of the conviction and dismissal of the indictment may have removed the patrolman's disability to hold office but it could not entitle him to reinstatement with back pay. The patrolman's removal was not unconstitutional because the legislature could fix the terms of the office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of obscenity in the second degree, and a sentence was imposed. Defendant's appeal brought forth for review the denial of defendant's motion to suppress certain statements. The prosecution of the case arose out of the exhibition of a 65-minute color motion picture. On appeal, defendant raised the issue of the admissibility of certain statements he made to a police officer. Defendant argued that his statements should have been suppressed because when he asked to call his attorney, he clearly expressed a desire not to be interrogated. The court stated that the testimony clearly showed that defendant voluntarily and spontaneously spoke after the police responded to his question. Therefore, the three statements made by defendant to police were all properly admitted into evidence as voluntary, unsolicited, or spontaneous statements. The court affirmed the judgment of the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nursing home provided care for the deceased. After Medicare was exhausted, the nursing home applied for Medicaid coverage on behalf of the decedent and the department of social services denied the application. The trial court declared N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 366&nbsp;unconstitutional to the extent that it denied the nursing home a fair hearing, and ordered a hearing. The hearing was never held. On appeal, the department of social services claimed that the nursing home was not denied due process because it had an adequate remedy at law, via a plenary action against the deceased, while the nursing home claimed that it was entitled to reimbursement and to a fair hearing. The court held that the nursing home was entitled to a fair hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which declared &sect; 366&nbsp;unconstitutional and ordered a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner voluntary not-for-profit nursing home has standing to challenge the constitutionality of section 366 of the Social Services Law and the regulations thereunder insofar as petitioner is not provided with the opportunity for a fair hearing to challenge an administrative determination denying eligibility for medical assistance to a patient, since an impenetrable barrier would otherwise be erected to any judicial scrutiny of the legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A facility providing services to an indigent who does not challenge a determination denying eligibility should have the opportunity to review the determination, since the fundamental purpose of the Medicaid law is to assist needy persons through the co-operative efforts of the hospital, patient and social services department, and payment is made directly to the provider of medical services.  Petitioner nursing home was deprived of due process by denial of the right to a fair hearing when a fair hearing request by the family of the patient was withdrawn at his death, since the property right to reimbursement for services already provided is in question and a person aggrieved has a constitutional right to a hearing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3. Petitioner should not be relegated to a plenary suit for breach of contract against the patient for services rendered. Such a suit would be contrary to the legislative scheme and would require a patient who is unable to pay for his medical care to defend a lawsuit for those payments, when a fair hearing might secure reversal of the adverse administrative adjudication.  While the patient has standing, he might fail to pursue the matter out of intention, lack of knowledge and, if he is dead, so might his family.  The provider of services has a more direct interest, is more likely than the patient to possess the specialized knowledge of legal requirements and has the resources to challenge an adjudication of ineligibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Accordingly, section 366 of the Social Services Law and the regulations thereunder unconstitutionally deprive petitioner of a fair hearing and Special Term properly directed that such hearing be held.  </SPAN></P>

The court found that at stake was not the individual's fundamental right to liberty, but rather that the giving of good time credits to an inmate was a matter of legislative grace. The court determined that prisoners had no constitutional right to release prior to the maximum expiration date of their sentences.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer sold and marketed four food products that were labeled as breakfast links, patties, strips, and slices.

Under Federal decisions dealing with essentially identical Federal statutory provisions, the ordinary understanding of &quot;imitation&quot; is an adequate statutory definition. Nor does the fact that there are Federal regulations establishing specific standards of nutritional inferiority as a test of whether one product is an imitation of another, while there are no such standards under the State statute, render it invalid, since, although the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets has discretion to adopt Federal regulations, he is not required to do so. </SPAN></P>

Whether a product is imitative of another depends upon the totality of the various factors present in a given case, and the resolution of this question must await the presentation of proof.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the mother of an allegedly neglected child, and the child, appealed an order of the Family Court, Ulster County (New York), which adjudged the child neglected and placed the child in the care and custody of the Ulster County Commissioner of Social Services for a period of 18 months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A neglect petition was filed when appellant's child was a few months old, and she was granted an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal pursuant to N.Y. Family Ct. Act &sect;1039. As a condition, appellant was to cooperate with the appropriate departments and avail herself of mental health counseling, parental care, and public health nurse instructions. The Department of Social Services charged that appellant failed to cooperate. Although the family court found that there was no evidence of either neglect or abuse, malnutrition or illness, at the dispositional hearing the child was placed in the custody of the of Social Services for 18 months because of appellant's serious lack of cooperation. Both appellant and the child sought review, alleging that the removal of the child was unwarranted. The court found that not only was there an absence of findings as to the best interests of the child, but there were no findings and no evidence of neglect, abuse, malnutrition, illness, or the like. The court reversed the order because of the denial of due process to appellant, the natural parent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the family court adjudging the child neglected and placing him in custody because there were no findings or evidence of neglect, abuse, malnutrition, illness, abandonment, surrender, unfitness or the like.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and child -- termination of custody -- neglected child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Although appellant mother in a child neglect proceeding was granted a six-month adjournment in contemplation of dismissal (ACD) (Family Ct Act, &sect; 1039) on the condition that she co-operate with the various supportive services offered to her, when the matter reappeared on the Family Court calendar, it was found that appellant had failed to substantially observe the terms and conditions of the ACD and, as required by subdivision (e) of section 1039, the Family Court found that circumstances of neglect were deemed to exist and proceeded to a dispositional hearing. Even though the Family Court found at the dispositional hearing that there was no evidence of either neglect&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or abuse, malnutrition or illness, the child was removed from the custody of the appellant and placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Social Services.  Mere proof of violation of an ACD order cannot by itself support a deprivation of custody. Under the circumstances constitutional due process requirements have not been met, since not only is there an absence of findings of the best interests of the child, but there has also been no actual judicial finding of neglect or abuse.  Moreover, by consenting to the entry of the ACD order, appellant did not waive the need for proof and findings of neglect and/or abuse.  Accordingly, the order must be reversed and the matter restored to the Family Court calendar for further hearings at which proof of facts constituting neglect, abuse or the like may be presented and findings made as to appellant's present capability to care for her child and the best interests of the child under present circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since notice of the challenge to the constitutionality of section 1039 was never given to the Attorney-General as required by section 71 of the Executive Law, the court is precluded from entertaining that question.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against the nurse arose from the nurse's alleged unlawful diversion for her own use of certain controlled substances and prescription drugs from hospitals in which she was employed, the alleged addiction to specific drugs, and her habitual drinking that led to her treatment at a clinic for chronic alcohol addiction. The nurse claimed that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6509 was unconstitutionally vague in that inadequately defined the proscribed conduct with which the nurse was charged. On review the court held that the statute in each instance sufficiently apprised a member of the profession of the scope of permissible conduct. The court noted that its review was restricted to a consideration of whether the decision of the agency was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary or capricious. That same limited review applied to proceedings to review the weight of evidence in disciplinary matters that involved professional licenses. The court found that there was substantial evidence to support the determination that the nurse was addicted to drugs and the revocation of her license was not so disproportionate to the offense as to be shocking to one's sense of fairness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant village appealed an order from the Supreme Court, Oneida County (New York), which denied its motion to dismiss the complaint of plaintiffs, former owner and current owner of business, for failure to state a cause of action, and granted plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant village appealed the trial court's order, which denied its motion to dismiss the complaint of plaintiffs, former owner and current owner of business, for failure to state a cause of action, and granted plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court's order was reversed and plaintiffs' complaint was dismissed. Defendant's motion for reargument was dismissed because an order denying a motion for reargument was not appealable. The court held that the trial court erred in declaring any part of N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 25 unconstitutional. The court held that an ordinance could forbid a change of use. Thus, a non-conforming use of land could not be changed to another non-conforming use, and the change from a restaurant and soda fountain business in 1965 to a tavern in which liquor was dispensed was clearly a change of use. The court held that it did not have jurisdiction to rule upon the validity and extent of the variance because the zoning board of appeals was not made a party to the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- nonconforming use -- variance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff Phillips, who was using his property for a restaurant and soda fountain operation at the time defendant village enacted its 1962 zoning ordinance, which placed plaintiff's property in an R-2 District, obtained a liquor license in 1965 and converted the use of his property to that of a restaurant and tavern. In settlement of an action brought in 1969 by defendant against plaintiff to enjoin him from continuing the operation of the tavern business, defendant's zoning board of appeals granted a variance to plaintiff for such use, but &quot;only so long as said premises&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shall be operated as a restaurant and/or tavern by the applicant&quot;.  In 1974 plaintiff Phillips entered into a contract to sell the property and business to plaintiff Burth on condition that the variance to operate the tavern would be extended to the buyer.  However, the buyer's application to the zoning board of appeals for an extension of the variance was denied.  Insofar as Special Term granted judgment determining that the 1974 determination by the zoning board of appeals denying an extension of the variance was void and insofar as it declared that the restriction in the 1969 variance should have no legal significance, the judgment is a nullity, since the zoning board of appeals was not made a party to this action and the court was without jurisdiction to make such an adjudication.  Moreover, such review of a variance may only be had by a CPLR article 78 proceeding and, with respect to the 1974 determination denying the variance extension, must be brought within 30 days (Village Law, &sect; 7-712, subd 3).  That same statute also bars an action for declaratory judgment for such review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The provision of section 25 of article IX of the zoning ordinance upon which Special Term relied&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to find the section unconstitutional, to the effect that &quot;All nonconforming uses of land shall be discontinued within two (2) years after the effective date of this ordinance as amended&quot;, was not invoked by the defendant or the zoning board of appeals in this case and therefore there was no occasion for the court to rule on its validity.  However, that part of section 25 of article IX of the ordinance which provides that a nonconforming use of land shall not be changed to another nonconforming use, is relevant.  Nevertheless, since the 1965 change to a tavern was clearly a change of use which violated the 1962 ordinance, and since an ordinance may forbid such a change of use, the court erred in declaring any part of section 25 of article IX of the ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The failure to join the zoning board of appeals as a party to this action deprived Special Term of jurisdiction to rule upon the validity and extent of the variance and to grant judgment declaring that the changed nonconforming use is transferable, assuming that the order may be interpreted as granting such relief.  Had the board been made a party, it might have asserted that the variance was personal to plaintiff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Phillips and if plaintiff Phillips denied that he so understood it, the board might have claimed that the variance was granted under mutual mistake of fact and demanded its rescission. If rescission were granted, there would have been no 1969 limited variance in effect and the change of use to tavern in 1965 would constitute sufficient ground for denying the requested variance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The appeal from the order denying the motion for reargument should be dismissed.  Said order is not appealable.  In any event, since such a motion is made on the papers submitted on the original motion and new facts may not be presented, additional facts contained in the papers in support of and in opposition to the motion for reargument may not be considered on this appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lot owner purchased lots within the city. The lots were zoned residential at the time of purchase. The area was rezoned light industrial. The city ordinance was then amended to limit industrial buildings to no more than three uses per building and by not more than three occupants, Town of Huntington, N.Y., Ordinances &sect; 62-6.1, subd. 10. The court held that the lot owners carried the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt no legitimate basis for the ordinance. But the lot owners failed to show no reasonable basis for the ordinance or that the ordinance was contrary to the city's master plan. The city's expert testified that the ordinance served a legitimate governmental purpose and that limited user tenancy was necessary to have maintained the area's character as a predominantly single-tenanted, large floor area. As to whether the ordinance would have achieved its purported goal of reducing density, the court reviewed the ordinance's constitutionality, not its wisdom or practicality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The owner of property located in a light industry district of a town has failed to meet its burden of establishing that no reasonable basis exists to sustain the constitutionality of an amendment to the town code restricting the use of a building or premises in the district to not more than three permitted uses, by not more than three occupants, with each separate use to occupy no less than 20,000 square feet of building gross floor area. On the rather eminent expert testimony&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  presented by the town, legitimate governmental purposes were sought to be achieved by the ordinance, and thus there exists the requisite foundation upon which constitutionality can rest.  As to testimony on behalf of plaintiff, consisting largely of projections as to whether the ordinance would result in lesser density, whether or not an ordinance may achieve one of its purposes is not determinative of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The ordinance is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ultra vires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  It promotes the general welfare, for it is reasonably related to the preservation of the character of the area, one of the most attractive industrial areas on Long Island.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner purchased property and made applications for special use permits, which were denied. The landowner filed a declaratory judgment that the &quot;Land Conservation District&quot; provision of the city's zoning ordinance was unconstitutional and void.

The ordinance was comprehensive and contained detailed use provisions and a carefully drawn map that evinced orderly and painstaking forethought.

The &quot;Land Conservation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  District&quot; provisions do not represent an impermissible delegation of legislative authority to the board of appeals.  The ordinance sets forth adequate standards to guide the board in granting special permits.  It is insignificant that the ordinance does not permit any use as of right in the district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The &quot;Land Conservation District&quot; provisions bear a substantial relation to a legitimate governmental purpose and a reasonable relation to the goal of flood safety.  It has not been shown that the special uses authorized for the district are so restrictive as to destroy the economic utility of plaintiff's property.  Accordingly, the ordinance does not violate due process and is constitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The failure to order a trial of the questions of fact raised by the attack on the constitutionality of the ordinance as applied to plaintiff's property was not error since that question was not before the court and the judgment of dismissal did not affect the portion of the complaint which raised that issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Since there has been no final determination by the State Department of Environmental Conservation that plaintiff's property cannot be filled, the complaint is premature&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  insofar as it attacks the ordinance as applied, on the ground that the denial of the right to fill the property violates due process.  Plaintiff has not exhausted his administrative remedies.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs and defendant sought review of the order issued by the Supreme Court, Monroe County (New York), that granted plaintiffs partial summary judgment in their action against defendant financing company for its failure to make requisite disclosures in loan documents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband and wife sued defendant financing company for its failure to comply with the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1601 et seq., in connection with a loan to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs claimed the loan's disclosure statement was unclear and confusing. Plaintiffs and defendant filed cross motions for summary judgment. Partial summary judgment was granted to plaintiffs. On appeal, the court affirmed summary judgment in plaintiff's favor as to a single claim. Defendant's disclosure statement was defective because it grouped together certain terms which were neither arithmetically nor logically related, and it failed to present related terms in a sensible fashion. As a result, plaintiffs' loan was void and as a couple, not individually, plaintiffs were entitled to the maximum amount permitted as a statutory penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment for plaintiff affirmed in part, reversed in part and modified. Plaintiff husband and wife were entitled to the maximum statutory penalty as a couple, not individually, for defendant's failure to provide an unambiguous disclosure statement to plaintiffs regarding the terms of a loan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Consumer protection -- loan agreement disclosure statement -- truth in lending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs entered into a loan obligation with defendant consumer finance company.  Thereafter, they brought suit against the defendant, claiming that the disclosure statement furnished them by defendant failed to comply with the Federal Truth in Lending Act (US Code, tit 15, &sect; 1601 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the regulations promulgated thereunder (Regulation Z, 12 CFR 226.1 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  .  In their first cause of action plaintiffs allege that the absence of an acceleration clause in the disclosure statement violated section 1639 (subd [a], par [7]) of the act and section 226.8 (b) (4) of the regulations. Both sections require disclosure of default, delinquency or similar charges payable in the event of late payments.  To the extent that this loan contract prescribes the same rebate method for refunding unearned precomputed interest upon acceleration as upon prepayment, the acceleration is not a &quot;charge&quot; requiring disclosure. However, since plaintiffs argue that disclosure is required because the formula for rebating insurance premiums upon acceleration results in a greater amount retained by the creditor than upon prepayment, the question arises as to whether defendant complied with section 1605 (subd [b]) of title 15 of the United States Code and 12 CFR 226.4 (a) (5) (ii), which provide that insurance charges shall be included in finance charges unless the debtor gives specific written indication of his desire for insurance coverage.  Whether such an indication was given here is specifically at issue in plaintiffs' second cause of action which cannot now be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  resolved since the issue has not been directly addressed by the parties.  Accordingly, plaintiffs are not entitled to summary judgment on their first cause of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant's statement of disclosure fails to set forth the items which must be disclosed clearly and conspicuously and in meaningful sequence. The disclosure statement groups together certain items which are neither arithmetically nor logically related, and fails to present sensibly those terms which do bear such relationships.  Accordingly, plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on their third cause of action alleging that the disclosures were not made in a meaningful manner in violation of subdivision (a) of section 1631 of the Federal Truth in Lending Act and section 226.6 (a) of the regulations promulgated thereunder should have been granted and they should be awarded a statutory penalty of $ 1,000 together with reasonable counsel fees.  Plaintiffs, husband and wife who entered into this single credit transaction, are not each entitled to recover a $ 1,000 statutory penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiffs are not entitled to summary judgment on their request for a refund of their payments on this loan pursuant to section 358&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Banking Law, which provides that any loan made in violation of section 353 of the Banking Law constitutes a misdemeanor and shall be void and that the lender shall have no right to collect or receive any principal, interest or charges.  Section 353 directs a lender to comply with the provisions of the Federal Truth in Lending Act and the civil penalties provided in section 358 apply to violations of that act.  Although section 358 operates to render this loan void, plaintiffs are not thereby vested with a right to recover payments of principal and interest voluntarily made upon a loan otherwise valid except for defective disclosure. Since plaintiffs assert that by stipulation with the defendant several payments were made under a reservation of rights and without prejudice, their claim may well bear on the issue of voluntariness and their fourth cause of action, to the extent of such payments, remains viable, but so much of that cause of action as seeks recovery of payments voluntarily made upon the loan should be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner applied for a permit to fill and grade his unimproved property. The town board denied the landowner's application, and the landowner sought review. The trial court determined that Riga, N.Y., Dump Ordinance &sect;&sect; 10, 10-A were unconstitutional and directed the town board to issue a permit to the landowner. On appeal, the court modified and affirmed. The court held that the permit should have been issued because the dump ordinance merely required the filing of a proper application and contained no standard to determine whether a permit should be issued. The court recognized the town board's authority to deny a permit despite the absence of standards where the town board reserved the power to issue or withhold permits; however, there was no such reservation present in the dump ordinance. Thus, because the landowner filed the proper application, the permit should have been issued. Additionally, Riga, N.Y., Dump Ordinance &sect; 10 precluded the unconditional denial of a fill permit. Because the dump ordinance was found to be constitutional, the trial court should not have considered the landowner's constitutional argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from order of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Westchester County (New York), that denied her motion for summary judgment and for a determination that the action was a proper class action in plaintiff's suit seeking injunctive and declaratory relief and damages, contesting the constitutionality of N.Y. Lien Law &sect;&sect; 184, 200, 201, 202, and 204.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued for injunctive and declaratory relief, and damages after defendant enforced a lien on plaintiff's car by selling it at auction. Plaintiff contested the constitutionality of N.Y. Lien Law &sect;&sect; 184, 200, 201, 202, and 204, which, inter alia, pertained to the sale of a vehicle to satisfy a garageman's lien. She made a motion for a determination that the action was a proper class action and for summary judgment. The lower court denied the motion in all respects. On appeal, the court found the only triable issue of fact presented related to the claims for damages raised by both parties. Sections 200, 201, 202, and 204 violated due process of law. The statutory scheme provided for prior notice of the sale. However, a garageman was authorized to enforce his lien for repair and storage charges by the sale of a car at public auction without affording its owner an opportunity for a hearing. Such a hearing, absent extraordinary circumstances, was an essential ingredient of due process. The actions of a private citizen could become the actions of the State for purposes of due process, as such actions did here. Class action relief was properly denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order that denied the motion for summary judgment and for a determination that the action was a proper class action was modified by granting plaintiff's motion for summary judgment to the extent of declaring certain sections of the New York Lien Law unconstitutional. As so modified, the order was affirmed, with $ 50 costs and disbursements to plaintiff payable by defendant and the action was remitted for a trial on the issue of damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Liens -- garageman's lien -- sale of automobile without hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Sections 200, 201, 202 and 204 of the Lien Law, which permit the sale of a vehicle at public auction to satisfy a garageman's lien without providing a prior hearing to the owner, are unconstitutional.  These procedures violate due process because of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  total deprivation of the significant property interest involved.  Under these enforcement statutes, no more than private gain is at stake, while, at the same time the sale of the bailor's car without a prior hearing could affect his ability to hold a job, making him a burden on family or friends.  In fact, such a situation is present under the circumstances here where plaintiff, whose car was sold at public auction pursuant to section 200 of the Lien Law for failure to pay repair and storage charges, has alleged that her automobile is needed by her in order to seek employment, to pursue the family's everyday activities and to enable her to travel to nursing school.  Accordingly, even though the statutory scheme provides for notice prior to the sale, absent extraordinary circumstances, due process requires that the owner be afforded an opportunity for a hearing where repair and storage charges may be contested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The fact of the constitutionality of section 184 of the Lien Law, which statute confers a possessory lien in favor of a garageman on a motor vehicle lawfully in his possession for storage, maintenance or repair charges allegedly due, is not applicable to the question of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  validity of the statutory scheme of the enforcement provisions, which permit absolute deprivation of use without a hearing as opposed to mere possession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The execution of the garageman's lien constitutes State action and invokes consideration of due process concepts.  The garageman, in executing his lien, is performing the traditional function of the Sheriff and is clothed with the authority of State law.  Moreover, the fact that plaintiff's car was sold at public auction by a &quot;duly licensed&quot; auctioneer and, after such a lien sale title was to be registered by the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles only upon presentation of the auctioneer's bill of sale, accompanied by documentary proof of his right to sell the vehicle and a newspaper clipping advertising the sale, also involves State action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Special Term was in error in denying a motion for summary judgment because of the presence of viable issues of fact.  There was no dispute about the fact that defendant enforced a lien upon plaintiff's car by selling it at auction pursuant to section 200 of the Lien Law without affording plaintiff an opportunity for a hearing and, therefore, the only triable issue of fact presented&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  relates to the claim for damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In view of the fact that subsequent complainants will be adequately protected under the principles of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">stare decisis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, class action relief was properly denied by Special Term.  </SPAN></P>

The commissioner determined, after a fair hearing, that the applicant had failed to rebut the presumption in &sect; 366(1)(e) that the transfer of stock was made for the purpose of qualifying for assistance and that the transfer had not been a normal transaction. The applicant appealed, and the commissioner's determination was upheld by the trial court. The applicant appealed again, and the court held that the statute and regulation at issue were constitutional. The court found that the applicant's authorization to transfer the stock was to repay an antecedent debt and hence was founded upon fair consideration. The court also found that the instrument making the conveyance clearly showed an intent to eventually authorize the stock transfer and was a &quot;normal transaction,&quot; notwithstanding the date of the instrument that affirmed the transfer.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- sign ordinances -- aesthetic zoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff billboard owners are entitled to a trial to determine if an ordinance of the Town of Southampton prohibiting nonaccessory signs constitutes an unconstitutional exercise of the police power by failure to reasonably relate to the public safety and welfare, since a factual issue exists thereto.  A zoning ordinance is not invalid because its primary objective is aesthetic, so long as it is substantially related to the economic, social and cultural patterns of the municipality, is reasonably designed to promote government interests in that regard and so long as any distinction between accessory and nonaccessory signs is reasonably&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The ordinance does not violate the right to freedom of expression.  Although the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Virginia Bd. v Virginia Consumer Council</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (425 U.S. 748) held that commercial speech is protected by the First Amendment, the case invalidated a statute imposing a total ban on publication of certain information and no considerations of aesthetics or other governmental concerns were involved.  Unlike that situation and unlike handbills, billboards present a constant and unsightly intrusion which may be the subject of valid exercises of police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers and organizations sought a declaratory judgment that the city was operating certain of its zoos in violation of the Agriculture and Markets Law of New York, was committing common-law waste, and was violating the New York City Administrative Code.

The court held that the greater harm was not presented nor any reason stated why the courts were more qualified or given greater authority to run zoos than to run the transit system. Furthermore, the mere allegation of common-law waste did not alter the thrust of the action from one to insert the courts and litigants into management of public business. It was not sufficient for the taxpayers to allege, or even prove, they could have done a better job than the public officials as neither they nor the courts had been given that responsibility.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Steuben County Court (New York), which convicted him of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.43, a class A felony, and sentenced him to a minimum of 15 years to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a graduate student and teacher, was convicted by the court, without a jury, of sale of a controlled substance in the first degree. He was sentenced to a minimum of 15 years to life. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment in the interests of justice pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 210.40, that the evidence substantiated his defenses of entrapment and due process violations, and that the sentence imposed was cruel and unusual punishment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying defendant's motion to dismiss because the evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming and his motivation for the crime was personal profit. The court noted that the entrapment defense was not available to defendant because the evidence showed that he regularly engaged in a criminal enterprise. Defendant's due process defense failed because the police did not engage in over-involvement in the crime that reached a demonstrable level of outrageousness when they lured him to New York for the drug sale. Defendant's sentence fit the statutory definition of the offender class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, and affirmed the sentence imposed of 15 years to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- controlled substances -- sale -- dismissal in interests of justice -- entrapment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying a motion to dismiss in the interests of justice ( CPL 210.40) an indictment charging defendant with the sale of a controlled substance. The evidence of defendant's guilt is overwhelming, his criminal activity reveals careful forethought and execution, and the record reasonably supports a conclusion that his motivation was personal profit.  In addition, his testimony was not credible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Evidence of other criminal acts of defendant shows that he was predisposed to commit the crime for which he was charged and, therefore, the defense of entrapment is unavailable to him.  The fact that defendant was lured into New York from Pennsylvania by an informant is of no help to defendant as regards the defense of entrapment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The conduct of the police did not reach such a demonstrable level of outrageousness as to result in a denial of due&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  process to defendant.  While the police are not to be encouraged to solicit foreign sellers of narcotics to set up shop in New York, their legitimate interest in the flow of contraband adjacent to our borders should not be foreclosed.  Improper conduct of the police in their relationship with the informant does not violate due process rights of defendant and, although the police are charged with knowledge of the actions of their informant, the conduct of neither the police nor the informant shocks the sense of justice mandated by the due process clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The mandatory sentence provisions of section 70.00 (subd 3, par [a], cl [i]) of the Penal Law do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment and are not grossly disproportionate punishments.  Both the defendant and his offense fit the statutory definition and the statute is not unconstitutional as applied to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Accordingly, the defendant was properly convicted of the criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed the judgment from the Monroe County Court (New York), which convicted him of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy in the first degree. On appeal, he raised eight points of error. The appellate court found no support for defendant's claim that surveillance tapes had to be sealed in the presence of or by a judge. The court also found no support for the contention that all tapes in a certain exhibit had to be excluded. The court affirmed the conviction because no constitutional rights were violated in the plea bargaining and sentencing process. The court noted that there was no evidence that defendant cooperated with the authorities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed criminal defendant's conviction of a criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy in the first degree because no constitutional rights were violated in the plea bargaining and sentencing process that resulted in defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- eavesdropping warrant -- sealing of recorded conversations -- chain of custody -- prejudicial statements -- plea bargaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The requirement of CPL 700.50 (subd 2) that recordings of communications be made immediately available to the issuing Justice upon expiration of an eavesdropping warrant and &quot;sealed under his directions&quot; does not require that the tapes be sealed in his presence.  The sealing of tape recordings of conversations involving defendant was properly done by a member of the Sheriff's office at the office of the District Attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is no reason to conclude that the Sheriff's deputy upon offering the tapes into evidence did anything more than miscalculate when he stated that the sealed box contained seven tapes, although there were actually eight.  The deputy's testimony that the box was in the same condition as when sealed negates any possibility of tampering, and there&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was a full foundation laid for the unchanged condition of the single tape utilized and the conversation offered in evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The prosecution established the necessary chain of custody with respect to a second sealed box of tapes and one tape contained therein despite testimony that a detective, who did not testify, had one tape removed after the sealing, returned it and resealed the box. The accuracy and identity of the tapes was attested to, and it would be unduly burdensome to require the production of every person who monitored any conversation on any of the tapes. Even if the single tape removed were inadmissible, the remaining tapes were properly admitted and sufficiently support the guilty verdict, such that the admission of the single tape would be harmless error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Both in the light of a testifying investigator's expertise and the general rule that lay witnesses may testify as to the doubtful, ambiguous or hidden meaning of statements made or heard by them, it was proper to receive testimony that, as used in a taped conversation, the word &quot;cola&quot; meant cocaine, &quot;rocky&quot; meant crystal or high grade cocaine, &quot;mix&quot; meant adulterant, &quot;piece&quot; meant an ounce of cocaine or heroin, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the term &quot;all in one&quot;, referring to money, meant $ 100 bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Testimony that the person who tipped the codefendant that a cocaine sale had been to Federal agents had died while the codefendant was in jail provides no basis for any prejudicial inference that defendant killed the tipster.  The testimony exculpates the codefendant and does not implicate defendant or even indicate that the death referred to was by anything other than natural causes.  Moreover, the question exists why defendant would wish to kill the person who warned him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. No prejudice resulted when the District Attorney elicited from the codefendant witness the fact that $ 50,000 bail had been posted, since nothing indicates that the District Attorney ever was aware of the form in which bail had been posted or by whom and defendant had arguably explored the matter by a question concerning the witness' financial condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Although a reference in the prosecution's summation to uncontradicted evidence of a certain telephone call improperly amounts to a comment upon defendant's failure to testify, that is not reversible error, since the court's charge sufficiently alleviated any detrimental effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trial court acted within its discretion in refusing to accept defendant's plea of guilty upon the People's consent to the class A-III felony of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree (Penal Law, &sect; 220.39) in satisfaction of a charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree (Penal Law, &sect; 220.43), a class A-I felony, based upon the earlier exhaustion of all pretrial proceedings concerning a reduced plea and the defendant's refusal to plead guilty to a class A-II felony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Defendant was not denied equal protection because he was not offered the option of pleading to a class A-III felony as was his codefendant, and his harsher sentence was not the result of his choice to stand trial.  Defendant was convicted of a different crime than his codefendant, and there was no obligation to treat the defendant equally, especially in view of the codefendant's co-operation with the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. It cannot be said that cocaine is irrationally classified as a narcotic drug, and the Legislature rather than the courts should deal with that issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Accordingly, defendant's conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree and conspiracy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the first degree should be affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner concert promoters appealed an order of the Supreme Court, Erie County (New York) that granted the motion of respondents, county, stadium owners, and other promoters, to dismiss their petition pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7804(f) that claimed a violation of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The promoters contended that the stadium owners' grant of an exclusive franchise in a public facility that it owned violated the Equal Protection Clause when the exclusive privilege was granted to the other promoters without a reasonable, necessary, or appropriate basis. They did not allege that the county was actively involved in any sublease of the stadium. The court affirmed and found that the petition was deficient on its face because it failed to set forth the facts to be sifted and the circumstances to be weighed without which there could be no threshold determination of state action. The mere fact that the stadium owners were the lessees of public property was insufficient, standing alone, to show state action. The petition failed to allege facts demonstrating any cognizable unconstitutional deprivation of equal protection of the laws entitling the promoters to relief. The petition itself acknowledged that the stadium owners declined to sublease the stadium to the promoters because they found them unqualified and not sufficiently experienced to produce an out-of-doors concert at the stadium. Such explanation provided a rational basis for the denial of the sublease.</SPAN></P>

The petition fails to set forth facts without which there can be no threshold determination of whether there was a sufficiently close nexus between the State, in this case the County of Erie, and the private body, the lessee, so that the action of the private body may be treated as that of the State.  The county had the authority to grant the exclusive right to the lessee to sublease the stadium and the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fact the lease is of public property is insufficient, standing alone, to show State action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner union appealed from the decision of the Supreme Court, Kings County (New York), which ruled in favor of respondent transit authority and held that the New York State Financial Emergency Act of the City of New York (FEA), L. 1975 chs. 868-870 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union filed an action challenging the constitutionality of the FEA, which suspended wage increases due under a collective bargaining agreement. The trial court held that the statute was constitutional. On appeal, the court modified the judgment, and affirmed. The court rejected the union's argument that the statute unconstitutionally abrogated existing contractual rights by ignoring more feasible efforts to relieve the city's financial plight. The court concluded that the FEA expressly included the transit authority and that there was a reasonable nexus between the city and the transit authority. The court further determined that the statute's differing treatment of the payment of wages due to the transit authority's employees and the payment of indebtedness under municipal bonds and notes did not abridge the equal protection clause. The court noted that the debts owing to bond and note holders had the constitutional guarantee of the faith and credit of the city. The court ruled that the statute barring the calculation of the pension benefits on the wage increase effective under the contract violated N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment by declaring the statute unconstitutional to the extent that it prevented the use of suspended wage increases in the computation of retirement benefits.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- wage freeze -- financial emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding by a labor union representing certain supervisory employees of the New York City Transit Authority, to declare unconstitutional provisions of the New York State Financial Emergency Act for the City of New York (L 1975, chs 868-870), enacted in response to the fiscal emergency arising in the affairs of New York City, which impose a wage freeze, suspending increases in the wages of employees of the city and of covered organizations, including the New York City Transit Authority, provided for in existing collective bargaining agreements, which suspension is not to be applicable in the event the employees or their collective bargaining representatives have agreed in writing to a deferment of the increases, the statute (FEA) is declared constitutional except to the extent that it prohibits the use of the suspended wage increases&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the calculation of pension benefits. The pension rights of the members represented by petitioner enjoy constitutional status (NY Const, art V, &sect; 7), in contrast to their rights to immediate payment of the increases in wages under their labor contract, and that constitutional status demands strict enforcement of the direction that those pension rights not be impaired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is a reasonable nexus between the city and the authority and, accordingly, the Legislature could treat the authority as an arm of the city and subject it to the same fiscal restrictions as those imposed on the city.  That there might be more feasible methods to relieve the city's financial plight does not render FEA unconstitutional as in abrogation of existing contractual rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The difference in treatment accorded to the employees and to city bond and note holders, whose debts are not frozen but deferred to a new date of payment with interest, has a rational basis.  Therefore, that difference in treatment involves no denial of equal protection to the employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There is nothing in the Federal Constitution or the Federal bankruptcy laws which bars the provisions of FEA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. To obviate any possible&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  misunderstanding in a direction by Special Term that the authority offer the employees represented by petitioner a voluntary wage increase deferral agreement similar to those previously certified by the Mayor and/or the Emergency Financial Control Board, that direction is modified by adding a provision that the offer shall be subject to section 10 (subd 2) of FEA.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother refused to send her children to school, and the trial court found that the mother had neglected her children under the Family Court Act.

The mother challenged N.Y. Educ. Law art. 65 as unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order of disposition. The court held that the five-hour daily requirement for school instruction under N.Y. Educ.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Because the yougest of her three children, then 6 1/2 years of age, was not doing well in reading and arithmetic at public school, a mother removed him from school and made sincere efforts to provide him with instruction at home which in her view was at least substantially equivalent to the instruction given at the school, as required by section 3204 of the Education Law, which also requires that instruction be given in 12 specified subjects, but she placed undue emphasis on subjects&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in which he showed interest, to the consequent neglect of other subjects, and she set aside only one and one-half hours per school day for his instruction as against the school's five-hour period for instruction, in violation of section 3210 of the Education Law, which requires that a minor attending upon instruction elsewhere than at a public school shall attend for at least as many hours.  She later removed her other two children, then aged 11 and 13, from school, insisting she could teach them anything they needed to know.  In the first of two separate proceedings instituted in the Family Court, the youngest child was declared neglected, after expert educators were called as witnesses for each side, and, in the second proceeding, in which the mother was faced with the statutory presumption permitting proof of neglect of one child to be admitted on the issue of neglect of any other child, and in which no expert witness supported her position, the older children were also found to be neglected. Family Court orders of disposition which discharged the children to the mother and placed her on probation on condition that the children attend school are affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The requirement of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  section 3210 of the Education Law that the period of instruction at home be at least the same as that provided by the school is not arbitrary in nature, nor does it impinge upon any constitutional right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient was committed to respondent psychiatric center after he was found not guilty of the crime of murder by reason of insanity. The patient sought a conditional release from the psychiatric center pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20. The Suffolk County Court (New York) denied the patient a conditional release and he sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that &sect; 330.20 was concerned with the commitment, confinement, and release of a criminal defendant who was acquitted on the grounds of mental disease or defect. The court further found that &sect; 330.20 permitted the discharge of a committed person upon a determination that he would not be a danger to himself or others, but that &sect; 330.20 did not address the respective burdens of proof in this matter. However, the court also found that, in denying the patient a discharge, the lower court held that the patient had the ultimate burden of establishing his lack of dangerousness and consequent right to conditional release from confinement. The court reversed and remanded the denial of the patient's request for release. The court held that, in requiring the patient to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was not presently dangerous to himself or to others as a condition of his being released from confinement in a mental hospital, the lower court infringed upon the patient's constitutional rights.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, who had been acquitted by reason of insanity of the murder of his wife and committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Mental Hygiene, who placed him in a psychiatric center, initiated a proceeding pursuant to CPL 330.20 for a conditional release, and, after a hearing on the issue of whether he might &quot;be discharged or released on condition without danger to himself or to others&quot;, the statutory test for such release under CPL 330.20, the County Court denied his application, holding that he had the burden, which he failed to sustain, of establishing his lack of dangerousness and consequent right to conditional release. Its order denying him a conditional release is reversed and the proceeding is remitted to it to make a new determination upon the record made and upon such other proof as the parties may offer. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In requiring petitioner to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was not presently dangerous to himself or to others as a condition of his being released, the court infringed upon his constitutional rights.  As the initiator of the proceeding, he had the burden of going forward with facts to raise an issue with respect to his lack of dangerousness, but the ultimate burden on that issue, which had not theretofore been judicially determined in any forum, rested upon the State.  He met his burden of going forward in the first instance when he presented the testimony of two psychiatrists who treated him at the psychiatric center and the center's director, to the effect that he was not dangerous.  The State then had the duty of meeting its constitutionally established burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he was presently dangerous and that, therefore, it could continue to deprive him of his liberty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The County Court properly authorized the District Attorney to employ two qualified psychiatrists to examine petitioner and testify at the hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action to foreclose certain mechanics' liens, and for other related relief, defendants sought review of an order by the Supreme Court at Special Term, Queens County (New York), which denied a motion by defendants for partial summary judgment dismissing the first cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff and defendant entered into a written contract for the construction of a warehouse. Subsequently, and within the time limited by statute, plaintiff caused to be filed against the premises four separate mechanics' liens for work, labor, and services rendered pursuant to the agreement. When a dispute as to payment arose, plaintiff commenced an action to foreclose its liens, whereupon defendant moved for summary judgment dismissing the first (foreclosure) cause of action on the following two grounds: (1) that plaintiff, having contracted and performed as defendant's agent, was not a valid lienor and (2) that N.Y. Lien Law &sect; 2 was unconstitutional insofar as it purported to authorize the filing of a mechanic's lien without prior notice or the opportunity to be heard, thus constituting an impermissible taking of property without due process of law. The trial court rejected the latter contention, sustained the constitutionality of the statute, and found a triable issue of fact as to plaintiff's lienor status. The court was in complete agreement with the trial court's reasoning and conclusion; therefore, the court affirmed the order denying partial summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Liens -- mechanics' liens -- constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Article 2 of the Lien Law authorizing the filing of a mechanic's lien is constitutional.  The filing of a lien does not result in the deprivation of any significant property interest and such minimal intrusion does not require prior notice or the opportunity to be heard in the context of due process of law. An owner is not deprived of the use or possession of his property including the right of alienation.  While the lien impinges on the economic interests of the owner, the improvements had increased the value of the property by the amount of the lien, the lienor is required to state under oath the facts giving rise to the lien, the owner may discharge the lien by depositing the amount thereof into court or by posting a bond, and the owner can compel an expeditious determination on the merits.  Accordingly, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the procedural safeguards in the statute effect a constitutional accommodation of the conflicting interests of the parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action to foreclose mechanics' liens filed by plaintiff for work, labor and services rendered pursuant to a contract for the construction of a warehouse in which agreement plaintiff was designated as &quot;agent for the owner&quot;, a triable issue of fact exists as to the validity of plaintiff's status as a lienor. </SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed certification of the suit as a class action. Plaintiffs' claims for recovery of a statutory penalty were permitted under state and federal law. The court modified the order requiring notice because it was premature. Further discovery proceedings to identify potential class members were required.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sign owner filed an action against defendant Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation in the Supreme Court at Special Term, Albany County (New York). The sign owner was denied an injunction to restrain the enforcement of N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 9-0305. Intervenor outdoor advertising association's motion to intervene was denied. The commissioner's cross-motion to dismiss was granted. The sign owner appealed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Outdoor sign regulation was a proper and valid exercise of the police power. Legislation whose legitimacy was measured against an aesthetic purpose had have met the test of reasonableness. Outdoor advertising that offended the eye and detracted from the natural beauty of the setting were legitimate targets of legislation requiring their removal and the commissioner did not need to pay any compensation where signs were regulated pursuant to the state's police power. The police power extended to all the public needs and if the means employed to regulate existing offending signs were reasonable, there could be no objection to their employment on the ground that the rights of private property were thereby curtailed. A reasonable period of amortization to enable one to recoup his investment was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

While the Federal Highway Beautification Act, in response to which said section 88 was enacted, declares it to be a national policy for States to seek to establish control of outdoor advertising by prohibiting erection and maintenance of such advertising in noncommercial areas, and further declares that any taking of such signs or structures by the States should result in the payment of compensation, it does not mandate the States to do so, but, in fact, provides for a 10% reduction in Federal highway funds if a State does not.  The State can, and has, elected to cause offending sign removal within the Catskill Park by employing its police power and providing for a reasonable period of amortization as an alternative to the payment of compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged the judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which confirmed the award of a public arbitration panel that had been established by the public employment relations board (PERB) following the request of respondent union pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PERB designated a public arbitration panel as requested by the union to decide a dispute between the union and the city regarding conditions of employment of the city police officers. The panel granted some of the demands of the union. The trial court confirmed the award and directed that the city comply with the terms. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that contrary to the city's argument, the arbitration panel had accepted the city's evidence pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 209(4)(c)(iii). The court held that the panel had not determined that the city could borrow money to pay the requested salary increases, as claimed by the city, but that it discussed raising taxes instead. Despite the city's contention that the panel improperly compared the police salaries in surrounding communities as a basis for the award, the court ruled that &sect; 209(4)(c)(v) authorized such a comparison. The court concluded that the panel properly considered the statutory criteria for balancing the city's ability to pay with the interests of the employees.

On appeal, defendant argued that the provisions of N.Y. Crim. Proc.

Defendant did not raise the invalidity of the statute limiting eligibility for youthful offender treatment on the highest count of the indictment until his appeal. Defendant also claimed that the trial court should have ordered the psychiatric examination before it accepted his plea. The sentencing court had a presentence psychiatric examination that described defendant as an alert, oriented, cooperative young man who was rational, coherent, and in contact with reality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted rape in the first degree and attempted sodomy in the first degree. At trial, the prosecutor made remarks in summation that tended to invoke a so-called &quot;safe streets&quot; argument, and he also suggested to the jury that its function was to convict. On appeal, the court held that although it neither approved of the prosecutor's remarks or condoned the propriety of making such a suggestion. The court found that the trial court's allowance of such comments was not reversible error, as the comments were made in response to the defense's attack upon the prosecution's witnesses and within the context of overwhelming proof of guilt. As the proof of defendant's guilt was virtually conclusive and there was no significant probability that the jury would have acquitted absent the errors, the summation errors were held to be harmless. Furthermore, the court held that the application of an evidentiary rule, N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 60.42, that excluded evidence of the victim's prior sexual conduct in sex offense cases, was proper. The trial, despite the earlier indictment, had begun after the statute's effective date. The judgment was therefore affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Section 414 stated that the court had the power to apportion the costs of support of the child according to the parents respective means and responsibilities, while N.Y. Fam. Ct.

The court determined that where both parents were capable of support, inquiry may have been granted as to the financial circumstances of both parents and that the father should not have been precluded from attempting to prove that the mother has her own substantial earnings even though his own earnings may have been adequate to have paid child support.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cross appeals were taken from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which, in a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding, rejected petitioner hospitals' constitutional challenge to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 10, &sect; 86.9(d) and directed respondent Commissioner of the Department of Health to hold full hearings on waiver applications, considering only factors related to the reasonableness of hospital costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged regulation limited reimbursements to hospitals by governmental agencies according to a formula based upon minimum utilization rates. The court found that &sect; 86.9(d) was validly enacted pursuant to the agency's delegated discretionary power and that a hearing was not a prerequisite to the initial function of establishing rates. Moreover, the regulation did not violate the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution. The court determined that a hearing was necessary, however, as to each hospital's application for a waiver from the minimum utilization requirement. Rendering decisions on such applications was judicial action, and due process required that each hospital be given an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence to establish that a waiver was warranted. Denial of a waiver predicated on factors unrelated to the reasonableness of hospital costs was arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that required hearings on the hospitals' waiver applications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- certification of reimbursement rate for health services -- necessity for hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The regulation (10 NYCRR 86.9 [d]), which, in part, limits governmental agency reimbursements to hospitals by a formula based upon minimum utilization rates of 60% for maternity, 70% for pediatrics and 80% for medical-surgical care, and which was formulated pursuant to subdivision 3 of section 2807 of the Public Health Law charging respondent commissioner with determining and certifying that the proposed rate schedule for payments to hospitals by governmental agencies are reasonably related to the costs of efficient production of health-related services, is constitutional.  The certification of a reduced rate for health services prior to a hearing does not amount to a denial of due process.  The establishment of rates is a legislative function, and a hearing is not a prerequisite&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unless the Legislature so directs, which it failed to do in the instant legislation.  There is a reasonable basis for the respondent's determination that an application of the regulation will result in rate schedules reasonably related to the costs of efficient production of hospital services, and, therefore, his determination should not be disturbed. Furthermore, there has been no violation of the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent's denial, without a hearing, of each petitioner hospital's application for a waiver of the section was improper.  Such action is judicial in nature and, under the circumstances, due process requires each petitioner be given an opportunity to be heard and present evidence to establish that a waiver was warranted.  Furthermore, the denial on the conclusory statement that granting the waiver was &quot;not found to be a matter of public interest and necessity&quot; was improper.  Finally, since a denial could not be predicated on grounds unrelated to cost efficiency, it was improper to deny the application of a waiver because of alleged operational and structural deficiencies based on the &quot;Life Safety Code&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

The evidence clearly established that defendant was previously convicted of second degree robbery in California, and that a sentence in excess of one year was authorized for that crime. In addition, a sentence in excess of one year was authorized for a comparable crime by N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 160.05. As such, the prerequisites of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of the judgment of the Court of Claims (New York), which denied the state's motion to consolidate respondent husband's wrongful death claim, filed on behalf of his deceased wife's estate, and the husband's personal injury claim, and which denied the state's motion for leave to file and serve a contribution counterclaim against the husband individually.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and his wife were in a car accident on a state road and his wife was fatally injured. Alleging state's negligence in the design, construction, or maintenance of the state road, the husband filed a claim against the state for personal injuries, and also filed a claim against the state, on behalf of his wife's estate, for wrongful death. The state requested that the trial court consolidate the claims and allow it to file a contribution counterclaim against the husband. The trial court denied the state's requests, stating that it was bound by precedent. The state appealed and argued that it would be in the best interest of justice, including promotion of judicial economy, to allow the consolidation and counterclaim, and argued that the precedent could be overruled or distinguished. The court held that the precedent was overruled to the extent it precluded a counterclaim in such a case. By commencing a suit in a court of claims, the husband impliedly consented to the interposition by the state of a counterclaim which the trial court could entertain, at least where the counterclaim arose out of the same or similar transactions that gave rise to the husband's cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Claims has jurisdiction to entertain a counterclaim for apportionment or indemnity filed by the State against the driver for any recovery had against the State upon the claim by the passenger's estate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teachers union and its president (collectively union) sought review of a judgment which enjoined the union from striking and which imposed sanctions for criminal contempt for willfully violating a temporary restraining order (TRO) and the preliminary injunction obtained by respondent board of education (board).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union argued that N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 211 operated to deprive public employees' equal protection of the law and that its application was unconstitutional. The union also argued that the TRO and preliminary injunction were invalid. The court held that the union failed to provide sufficient evidence to rebut the strong presumption of the constitutionality of &sect; 211. The court held that the TRO was valid and was necessary as evidenced by the fact that the union had threatened to strike, which would have caused irreparable harm. The court further noted that &sect; 211 allowed a TRO to issue based only on a threat of a strike. The court found that the trial court did not err when it issued the preliminary injunction, because the record revealed that at the time the injunction was issued, the union contrary to the TRO, was on strike. The court held that the union was not denied a right to a fair trial during the second contempt proceeding, after the first had been reversed, because there was no evidence that the judge was prejudicial or biased and the fact that the trial judge found them again guilty of contempt and imposed the same sentence did not prove bias.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which imposed criminal contempt penalties and a preliminary injunction upon the union.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- Public Employees' Fair Employment Act -- illegal strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The lack of statutory power of the Public Employment Relations Board to enforce its decisions directing negotiations between public employers and employees by compelling specific performance of negotiated agreements has not been shown to create any imbalance denying public employees equal protection of the law in view of the statutory prohibition against employee strikes, since no proof has been presented that public employers and employees are in the same class for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Absent proof that public employers and employees are in the same legislative classification, no constitutional question is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  presented by denial of any right of school employees to negotiate directly with the city, although the board of education is bound in fixing wages and salaries by the budget allocated by the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 204-a of the Civil Service Law, providing that public employment collective bargaining agreements contain a notice that provisions requiring legislation or additional funds are subject to legislative approval, explicitly recognizes that the public employer's authority to enter a contract is subject to the appropriation of funds.  Accordingly, the public employees' statutory right to negotiate may properly be altered by legislative enactment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A temporary restraining order prohibiting defendants from engaging in a strike was sufficiently supported by allegations that a strike was threatened, and any lack of factual allegations of irreparable harm is not fatal, since a strike of public employees by its nature causes irreparable harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Since public employees were on strike in violation of section 210 of the Civil Service Law a preliminary injunction was properly issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Although orders enjoining defendants from engaging in various strike activities would be subject to modification&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the extent that they exceeded the prohibitions specified in section 210 of the Civil Service Law, the issue is moot, since the strike has ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Notwithstanding overbroadness of the injunction, the orders were not void upon their faces, had to be obeyed and may properly be the basis for a conviction of criminal contempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The holding of a second contempt proceeding before the same Justice who presided over the first hearing, after the first was overturned for lack of personal jurisdiction, did not deprive defendants of a fair trial. There was no claim of prejudice on the first trial, and a mere showing of prior judicial exposure to the parties or questions does not require disqualification of a Justice.  Actual bias does not necessitate reversal unless the Justice's decision is based thereon, and no such bias may be found from the fact that the Justice had previously found the defendants guilty and that he employed similar language in his two decisions on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The finding that the defendant president of a public employee union was guilty of criminal contempt was adequately supported by evidence that he failed to take action to rescind strike recommendations and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that he stated that he would not do so until union demands were negotiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. A 30-day sentence of imprisonment and a $ 250 fine against the individual defendant were within the limits provided by section 751 of the Judiciary Law, and absent a clear abuse of discretion the imposition of such sentence should not be reversed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11.  Section 751 of the Judiciary Law (subd 2, par [a]) allows the court, in fixing contempt punishment, discretion as to consideration of acts of extreme provocation by the public employer, and, absent a clear abuse of discretion there may be no review of the sufficiency of the consideration given to that factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. In fixing the sentence for contempt, the court properly evaluated the impact of the strike upon the public health, safety and welfare, finding that school children were deprived of the services of union members as a result of the defendants' illegal actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. Although less than half of the union dues collected were retained for local use, rather than the two thirds found by the court, there was no abuse of discretion in setting the fine against the defendant union.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent state sought review of the decision from the Court of Claims (New York), which granted damages and attorney fees to claimant property owner for a taking caused by a temporary easement created when the legislature attempted to take the property owner's land through a statutory condemnation proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature passed a bill that delayed the issuance of a demolition permit to the property owners and permitted the state to take the property owner's land through condemnation proceedings. The property owner successfully challenged the constitutionality of the law and thereafter made a claim for the temporary taking of its property. The trial court awarded damages for lost rental profits and also awarded attorney fees for the legal fees and expenses incurred in the course of having the statute declared unconstitutional. The state challenged the decision and the court reversed and remanded. The property owners were only entitled, by virtue of the temporary easement, to receive as damages all carrying and maintenance costs during the period of the easement. Any damages for the increased construction costs caused by the delay in construction would have been offset by increased rents due to the same inflation. Additionally, the award of attorney fees was inappropriate because the fees were associated with a prior action and the property owner was not entitled to the reimbursement of its legal expenses associated with vindicating its rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the award of damages and attorney fees in favor of the property owner and remanded for a determination of the carrying and maintenance costs associated with the state's temporary easement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent domain -- compensation -- temporary appropriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After it was established that a taking resulted from the eight-month delay in issuing claimant a permit to demolish the old Metropolitan Opera House pursuant to the terms of a lease, which situation resulted from an unconstitutional statute authorizing the withholding of the demolition permit upon the deposit of $ 200,000 as security pending action of a corporation newly created for the purpose of acquiring and preserving the &quot;Old Met&quot; by condemnation proceedings (L 1966, ch 691), damages were awarded for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the temporary appropriation of claimant's interest.  The Court of Claims erred in awarding lost profit and increased construction costs, there being nothing but speculation as to any damage to the claimant when considered as a temporary, total easement. The present action presents an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ad hoc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> situation in which the Legislature attempted to provide just compensation for the withholding of a demolition permit and the situation is such as to require an exception to the general rule of damages for loss of rental value. Accordingly, the existence of a temporary easement requires that the claimant receive as damages all carrying and maintenance costs during the period of the easement. Except for such costs, the claimant failed to establish any damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It was error to award claimant legal fees and expenses incurred in litigating the constitutionality of chapter 691 of the Laws of 1966.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Putative father sought visitation of children he claimed to have had with the natural mother. The mother denied the father's paternity and filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 651. The trial court denied the motion. The mother sought review and argued that that &quot;custody&quot; as used in the statute did not include &quot;visitation&quot; and that the family court lacked jurisdiction under the statute to entertain a petition for visitation. The court affirmed. It found that &quot;custody&quot; as used in N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 651 did not exclude &quot;visitation&quot; and did not require dismissal of the petition. It found that visitation was a form of limited custody and it was well-established that the standard of adjudication in either instance was the &quot;best interests&quot; of the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner teachers appealed a decision of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Monroe County (New York), which dismissed their petition for reinstatement in an action against respondent Board of Education of City School District of City of Rochester that involved tenure issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teachers worked for the school district in the pre-kindergarten area. Federal funding was reduced and the board abolished their positions and terminated them on the ground that they had the least seniority in terms of continuous years of service than the other teachers in their area. The teachers brought an action for reinstatement, but the trial court dismissed their petition. The teachers appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the pre-kindergarten tenure was part of the kindergarten area and that meant that they had seniority over some of the kindergarten teachers. The court reversed and remitted to the board, holding that pre-kindergarten was included in the elementary tenure area, and the board was required to determine the teachers' seniority by a comparison with all elementary teachers. The court held that if the teachers were not the least senior elementary teachers, they were to be reinstated with back pay, benefits, and privileges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remitted a judgment that dismissed the teachers' petition in an action resulting from a board decision terminating the teachers because they were in a separate tenure area than other elementary teachers and that had less seniority in their tenure area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- teachers -- tenure areas -- pre-kindergarten teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the absence of reported decisions regarding the status of pre-kindergarten teachers with respect to tenure areas, any evidence of historical custom or practice which would shed light on the question, or any compelling authority on either side of the question, it is held that pre-kindergarten teachers are included in the elementary tenure area even if they were appointed prior to August 1, 1975, the effective date of a rule of the Board of Regents which provides that &quot;Kindergarten (including pre-kindergarten programs) together with the first six grades shall constitute the elementary tenure area&quot; (8 NYCRR 30.4).  Accordingly, a judgment of Special Term, which dismissed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a petition in a proceeding for reinstatement brought by teachers who had taught in a nursery school project which was Federally funded, and whose positions were abolished due to a reduction in that funding, is reversed, and the matter is remitted to the board of education of their city school district for a determination of their seniority by a comparison with all teachers in the elementary tenure area, and, in the event they are not the least senior teachers in that tenure area, for their reinstatement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Joinder of allegedly less senior teachers as parties to petitioners' proceeding would have been premature, since the board acted in a mistaken belief as to which tenure area petitioners occupied, and never determined their relative seniority within the elementary tenure area. The prescribed standards for determining seniority can become complicated, and the orderly and desirable way to proceed is to have the board make the determination initially.  Once it identifies those teachers it deems least senior, they, if so advised, may seek judicial review and join those whom they seek to oust.  </SPAN></P>

Specifically, the owner contended that &sect; 63(8) was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the supreme court's judgment denying the owner's motion to quash because no authority was presented for declaring &sect; 63(8)&nbsp;unconstitutional due to the undefined breadth and scope of the investigatory powers conferred on the special prosecutor. The court found that if credence was given to the owner's challenge, the legislature would have to authorize every criminal investigation by the attorney general's office no matter how narrow, germane, and infused with the public interest the desired investigation might be.

However, the court held that the retirees, who were elected or not elected, had a vested right in their unused sick leave pursuant to N.Y. Retire &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 33, 41.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In computing the retirement allowances of elected county officials, lump sum payments for accumulated unused vacation time, which were authorized by their county, are not includible.  Such payments are to be excluded from the computation under section 431 of the Retirement and Social Security Law, and, while it has been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judicially determined that that section was unconstitutional if applied to public employees who were members of the Retirement System before the date of its enactment, the basis of that decision was that such members had acquired a vested right to the benefit arising from an established pattern of prior administrative practice. Elected public officials have not acquired such a vested right since, with respect to them, the Comptroller has consistently followed a policy of disallowing retirement credit for such payments, stating, in an opinion, that he considered such payments made to elected officials to be highly irregular, improper and probably illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. However, elected county officials are entitled to additional retirement service credit for accumulated unused sick leave, a benefit which their county elected to extend to them.  There is specific statutory basis for the inclusion of such leave ( Retirement and Social Security Law, &sect;&sect; 33, 41), with no distinction made between elected and nonelected employees or members, in sharp contrast to the statutory prohibition against the inclusion of lump sum payments for accumulated unused vacation time. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners appealed from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Sullivan County (New York), which declared certain zoning ordinances of defendant town valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners presented a preliminary plot plan for the development of a mobile home park to the town when there were no regulations governing the submission of subdivision plans to the planning board and no zoning ordinances concerning subdivisions or mobile home parks. After the town enacted ordinances requiring a one-acre lot for conventional and mobile homes. The landowners sought a judgment declaring the various ordinances unconstitutional and ineffective to prevent them from using their property for any use permitted when they presented their plan. The court affirmed the trial court's declaration that the ordinances were constitutional. The statutory requirements of N.Y. Town Law &sect; 263 were met because implicit in the ordinances was the element of planning that was rational and consistent with basic land use policies of the community. The town made a sufficient showing that there was some rational planning prior to adoption of the ordinance and the ordinance was consistent with the community's development policies. The landowners did not have any vested rights prior to adoption of the ordinance and failed to demonstrate the other permitted uses were not feasible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment declaring the challenged zoning ordinance constitutional was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- constitutionality of ordinances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs had presented to the Town Board of the Town of Forestburgh and the Town Planning Board a preliminary plot plan for the development of a mobile home park before rules or regulations existed for the submission of plans to the Planning Board and before there were any zoning ordinances in the town concerning subdivisions or mobile home parks.  As applied to plaintiffs' property, subsequently enacted ordinances, i.e., a house trailer ordinance, a subdivision ordinance and a comprehensive zoning ordinance superseding the first two which required a minimum one-acre lot, are constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The zoning ordinance is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ultra vires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  There was a sufficient showing of a comprehensive plan which was rational and consistent with the basic land use policies of the sparsely populated town which is rural and rustic&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While the proof may have established that plaintiffs would suffer significant economic injury if the ordinances were enforced, a showing that the town was concerned with preserving its rural and rustic nature and that the character of the community would be adversely affected by the proposed development shifted the burden to plaintiffs to establish that the ordinance amounted to a taking and this they failed to do.  Furthermore, they failed to meet the burden of overcoming the presumption of constitutionality. Consequently, the ordinance is not confiscatory as applied to plaintiffs' property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Expenditures for an evironmental impact study and other preliminary inspections did not vest any rights in plaintiffs.  Lack of actual construction, coupled with the notice plaintiffs had that a one-acre minimum for subdivisions was under consideration, compels the conclusion that they failed to establish a vested interest. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted a law that no person would be eligible for election to enumerated offices who had not been a domiciled resident of the city for a period of at least two years preceding the date of the election. The voter, who did not meet the residency requirement, filed an action seeking a declaration that the law was unconstitutional and void. The trial court declared the law unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the residency restriction invidiously discriminated against the voter and others and violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the state and United States Constitutions. The city failed to meet its burden to show that the limitation upon candidates and voters was essential to serve a compelling state interest. It served no necessary governmental objective for the city to declare that a two-year city resident had a greater familiarity with and a greater stake in the problems, conditions, needs, and life of his community than a more recent resident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court declaring that the city's local law establishing a two-year residence requirement for eligibility to hold enumerated offices was unconstitutional, in the declaratory judgment action brought by the voter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- durational residency requirement for public office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Local Law No. 1 of the Local Laws of 1975 of the City of Buffalo, effective January 7, 1975, which provides that &quot;No person shall be eligible for election or appointment as a successor to the office of mayor, comptroller, president of the council or councilman-at-large who has not been a domiciled resident of the city for a period of at least two (2) years preceding the date of his election or appointment&quot;, is unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of both the Federal and the State Constitutions.  The residency restrictions imposed by it invidiously discriminate against the candidates impeded thereby and the voters who wish to support them, and there has been no demonstration of any compelling governmental need for the imposition of such restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A resident of the city since June, 1974, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  who was an unsuccessful candidate for the office of President of the Common Council in the 1974 general election, when there was no durational residency requirement for eligibility to hold any of the offices enumerated in the local law, and who was an alleged intended candidate for the office of councilman-at-large in the 1975 general election, had standing to bring the present action for a declaration that the local law was unconstitutional.  Having qualified as a candidate in the past, he had a legally protected interest which was adversely affected in a real and immediate manner by its promulgation.  Additionally, his status as a qualified voter in the city gives him standing to complain of a claimed unconstitutional encroachment upon his right to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although the issue is academic and moot as to this plaintiff's candidacy, since he never became a candidate for city-wide office in 1975 despite the trial court's declaration that the local law was unconstitutional, nor, apparently, did he attempt to do so, the controversy is of public importance and of a character likely to recur with respect to others, warranting a determination of the issues raised.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff home relief benefit recipients obtained a preliminary injunction in the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), preventing defendant Commissioner of the New York State Department of Social Services from implementing 1976 N.Y. Laws ch. 76, &sect; 15, amending N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 158(a). The Commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The benefit recipients argued that the statute, affecting eligibility for home relief, violated the New York Constitution. The court held that although the argument might not ultimately have been successful, it was based on substantial principles of constitutional law and involved novel issues of first impression. The question of the statute's validity involved aspects of constitutional law too weighty to have been briefed adequately in the short time available to the parties before the motion was heard in the trial court and too complex for the trial court to resolve in the even shorter time available to it before its decision was required. In view of the conceded irreparable harm facing the benefit recipients, contrasted with the damage the state would face by postponing implementation of the statute until the case could be heard on its merits, a preliminary injunction was appropriate. It was error for the trial court to have orally declared the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social services -- home relief -- eligibility of persons under 21 years of age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs were about to have their home relief benefits terminated as a result of a proposed implementation of section 15 of chapter 76 of the Laws of 1976, which amended section 158 (subd [a]) of the Social Services Law to provide that no person under 21 years of age except a married person living with their spouse, living apart from a legally responsible relative shall be eligible for home relief unless a proceeding has been brought by or on behalf of such person to compel the legally responsible relative to provide for or contribute to such person's support and until an order of disposition has been entered in such proceeding.  In an action by them for judgment declaring the amendment unconstitutional, wherein their right to ultimate relief is predicated upon an argument that the amendment is violative of important&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  principles contained in the New York Constitution, they moved for a preliminary injunction against the implementation of the amendment pending a final resolution of the merits of their action.  Special Term properly exercised its discretion in granting their motion.  They would suffer irreparable injury if the preliminary injunction was not granted, in contrast to the damage the State would face by postponing implementation of the statute until the case can be heard on the merits, and, while their argument may not prove to be ultimately successful, it is based on substantial principles of constitutional law and involves novel issues of first impression, too weighty to have been briefed adequately in the short time available to the parties before the motion was heard at Special Term and too complex for Special Term to resolve in the even shorter time available to it before its decision was required.  This is precisely the situation in which a preliminary injunction should be granted to hold the parties in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">status quo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while the legal issues are determined in a deliberate and judicious manner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While Special Term properly granted the preliminary injunction, it erred when, at the hearing on the motion, it seemingly determined the merits by orally declaring that the amendment was unconstitutional.  However, it did not repeat this finding of unconstitutionality in the order which it rendered.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents terminated the tenured teacher's services even though a panel conducted a hearing pursuant to N.Y, Educ.

The court modified the decision and affirmed, finding that (1) N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3020-a was not violated because the Board sufficiently stated the reasons relied upon for the determination; (2) there was no evidence that the Board had a pecuniary interest in the matter that resulted in bias against the teacher, and there was no due process violation due to the combined decision making and investigatory powers in the Board; (3) there was substantial evidence to support the Board's findings as to the charges of inefficiency and incompetency, but the finding that the teacher committed the minor transgressions failed to support the Board's determination that she was guilty of the charges of insubordination, neglect of duty, and conduct unbecoming a teacher. Because the second charge was not supported by the record, the Commissioner's action as to that charge was arbitrary and the penalty imposed had to be reassessed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-husband obtained an absolute divorce against the ex-wife on the grounds of cruel and inhuman treatment. A default judgment was entered that awarded support and maintenance to the ex-wife, of which only a few payments were made. The ex-wife brought an action in family court to collect the arrearages and to modify the support order. The ex-husband moved to vacate the support order and to stay the proceedings on grounds that N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect;&sect; 236, 244 and 245, and Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 412, were unconstitutional. The court affirmed the order, finding that the ex-husband did not have standing to attack the constitutionality of the statutes. The court found that (1) the ex-husband waived his right under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 236 to negate his obligation to pay support when the divorce was based on the ex-wife's misconduct because his agreement to pay was given in exchange for the ex-wife's agreement to an uncontested divorce; (2) the ex-wife relied on the agreement and waiver; (3) the ex-husband could not be relieved of the support obligation he assumed; and (4) the support obligation was not based on Fam.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner citizen instituted a proceeding to determine whether respondent public official, who occupied the offices of county legislator and motor vehicle supervisor, held incompatible offices and had violated N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 801. The Supreme Court at Special Term, Yates County (New York) held that the offices were incompatible and granted the citizen's summary judgment motion, and the public official appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A motor vehicle supervisor was elected to the county legislature and continued to hold her supervisor's office but refrained from voting on matters affecting her salary. She claimed that a citizen lacked standing to bring suit, that her right to hold office could only be tested in an action quo warranto, and that requiring her to vacate her office disenfranchised the voters in her district. The court held that the official had violated &sect; 801 and must resign from one office. As a taxpayer and county resident the citizen had standing to challenge dual office holding under a statute enacted for the community's benefit. A quo warranto proceeding was not the exclusive remedy where the issue was one of law and no factual determinations were required. The county legislature set the motor vehicle supervisor's salary and it was immaterial whether the official refrained from voting on salary matters because the possibility of wrongdoing prohibited the holding of incompatible offices. The statute was not unconstitutional and did not arbitrarily exclude the official from office because there was a rational basis for the public policy stated in &sect; 801 forbidding conflicts of interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in the citizen's favor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public officers -- dual employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent may not serve in the position of County Legislator to which she was elected and continue to hold her prior appointive position as County Motor Vehicle Supervisor, for which her salary is fixed by the County Legislature, since section 801 of the General Municipal Law provides that municipal officers may not have an interest in any municipal contract for which they have a duty to negotiate, prepare, authorize or approve the contract or payment thereunder. The statutory purpose is to avoid the possibility of breach of trust and, accordingly, the acceptance of an office implies resignation of a prior incompatible office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although quo warranto is generally the remedy available to try title to an office, mandamus is proper where, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as here, the issue is solely one of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since there is no question of fact, summary judgment is appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioner, as a county resident and taxpayer, has standing to bring a proceeding based upon a violation of section 801 of the General Municipal Law, since the statute was enacted for the benefit of the community in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The requirement that respondent resign from one of her two offices does not unconstitutionally disenfranchise the voters of her district, since respondent may, by resignation from her appointive office, serve in the elective office, and the requirement has a reasonable basis.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state commissioner challenged the order of the Supreme Court of Orange County (New York), which declared N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 365(2) and N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 360.21(e) unconstitutional and remitted the application filed by appellee father for financial assistance for psychiatric treatment for his son.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's son suffered from severe mental and psychiatric problems, although he had never been declared judicially incompetent. The father applied for medical assistance under the Social Services Law in placing his son in a private institution. The county commissioner denied the application, and the state commissioner confirmed the decision. The father argued that his adult child had been deprived of the equal protection of the laws because the statute and the regulation unlawfully discriminated in their classifications, based upon age and the kind of illness described. The court reversed the trial court's order because neither the statute nor the regulation violated the requirements of the equal protection of the laws. The court applied the rational basis standard and determined that the statute and regulation did not offend the equal protection of the laws. The court took into account the circumstances surrounding the status of the young and elderly in the community and the nature of the treatment a mental illness involved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court that declared provisions of the Social Services Law unconstitutional was reversed, and the father's action was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social services -- Medicaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 2 of section 365 of the Social Services Law and 18 NYCRR 360.21 (e), which provide for medical assistance to eligible persons under 21 years of age or 65 years of age and over who are receiving in-patient psychiatric services, are constitutional and are not violative of equal protection. The subdivision and the regulation are part of the State plan implementing the Federal Medicaid program.  In determining to whom assistance is to be provided, the subdivision and regulation establish classifications based upon a person's age and type of disability. As a result of these classifications, assistance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is not provided for in-patient services in private hospitals for persons suffering from mental disabilities who are over 21 years of age and under 65.  Traditionally, the young and the old have been objects of the community's solicitude and classification by age has been a conventional legislative method for marking the area of statutory application.  Since age limitations may appear arbitrary from one view, yet rational from another, the matter of determining the age limitations is left to the legislative judgment, which must be afforded the preference in our system of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Legislature may also choose to limit benefits on the basis of the type of disability and, within a type, may limit assistance to those persons in public institutions.  The rational basis supporting these limitations may be the experimental nature of the program or budgetary restrictions.  Classifications in the law need not be perfect to be constitutional.  The Legislature cannot be faulted for addressing itself to only one phase of a problem or for failing to treat all afflictions equally.  Choices must and will be made and priorities must and will be set.  Accordingly, plaintiff's application for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  medical assistance in placing his 24-year-old mentally disabled son in a private institution was properly denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners builders sought review of the decision of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Essex County (New York), which granted respondent Adirondack Park Agency (agency)'s motion to dismiss and confirmed a determination by the agency prohibiting the constriction by the builders of any boathouse on the shore of the lake within the boundaries of Adirondack Park.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The builders petitioned the agency for the construction of part of the parkland. The agency granted the builder a permit on the condition that the builders were not to build boathouses on agency property. The builders filed suit and the trial court granted the agency's motion to dismiss. The builders appealed and on appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court found that both parties presented no actual triable issue of fact. The court also concluded that the agency had authority to ban boathouses on agency administered private property because before the agency approved a project or granted a permit therefor, it was required to find that the project would not have had an adverse impact upon the natural, scenic or aesthetic resources of the park pursuant to N.Y. Exec. Law &sect;809(10)(e). The court concluded that the agency possessed the proper constitutional delegation of power and that their decision was not arbitrary or capricious. The area surrounding the builder's property was in a relatively pristine state and the agency could have reasonably found that the addition of several boathouses would have adversely affected the aesthetic quality of the area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court and found that no triable issue of fact necessitated a trial was presented, the agency had the authority to ban boathouses on agency administered private property, and the agency's determination was not arbitrary nor capricious when they conditioned the builders project on that no boathouses were to have been built.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondents have authority to ban the construction of boathouses by petitioners on Adirondack Park Agency administered private property.  The delegation of power to the agency to impose such conditions in granting a permit as are allowable within the proper exercise of the police power ( Executive Law, &sect; 809, subd 13), which power includes preserving the appearance of an area, is not unconstitutional, the Legislature having provided sufficient standards to guide the agency in the review of projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The restriction forbidding boathouses was rational since&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the area surrounding petitioners' property is in a pristine state and since the subject property fronts on a much traveled pleasure boat route.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, mother and child, filed an action against defendant hospital. Plaintiffs alleged that the hospital negligently treated the child. The Supreme Court, Greene County (New York) dismissed the complaint on the ground that plaintiffs failed to comply with the time requirements of N.Y. County Law &sect; 52 and N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 50-i.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital was a municipality within the meaning of N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect;&sect; 50-e, 50-i. N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 50-e required that notice of a tort claim be served upon a municipality within 90 days after the claim arose. The statute extended the time to a maximum of one year in certain cases. Plaintiffs failed to serve notice within the extended period. However, plaintiffs served their complaint within the three-year statute of limitations. The court held that the notice of claim prerequisite did not deny plaintiffs equal protection or due process. Because the hospital operation was considered a governmental function, plaintiffs were dependent upon legislative grace for their cause of action. Thus, there was no equal protection violation even though the hospital had a shorter time limitation then private hospitals. Additionally, the shortness of the 90-day limitation was not so unreasonable that it violated due process. The mother was presumably aware the child had suffered some injury before 90 days had elapsed because the complaint alleged that the hospital's negligence caused quadriplegia.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs brought a medical malpractice action against a hospital operated by Greene County, a municipality within the meaning of sections 50-e and 50-i of the General Municipal Law, within the time allowed by the applicable Statute of Limitations but more than one year after the injury.  Section 50-e of the General Municipal Law provides that as a prerequisite to any tort action against a municipality a notice of claim must be served within 90 days after the claim arises.  Due to the nature of the injuries, presumably the plaintiff mother was aware of the existence of a claim before 90 days elapsed. Since the operation of a hospital is one of the &quot;governmental&quot; functions of government and the right to sue the government in this capacity is granted as a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  matter of legislative grace, the Legislature may withold or condition the right to bring suit as it sees fit.

The court concluded that his affirmative defense, alleging that the absence was unavoidable, was solely concerned with why defendant was absent from court and was unconcerned with his state of mind or intent, so the defense was in the nature of a confession and avoidance, with no burden on defendant to establish or negate an essential element of the crime. The court also held that bail jumping in the second degree was not a lesser included crime of bail jumping in the first degree in defendant's case because one was tied exclusively to the existence of a pending misdemeanor charge and the other was tied to a pending felony charge, so the counts were concurrent but noninclusory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district attorney conceded that under the circumstances, the count of grand larceny in the second degree was a lesser included concurrent count to robbery in the first degree. Defendant's contention that N.Y.

Penal Law &sect; 160.10, was without merit. N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 160.15(4) was not unconstitutional. Placing the burden of proof on defendant as to a fact peculiarly within his knowledge did not deny him the benefit of the presumption of innocence. With respect to the refusal to direct separate trials of defendant on each of the two robberies charged, N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 200.20(2)(c) permitted joinder of similar crimes. On the record no prejudice accrued to defendant from such joinder so as to deprive him of a fair trial. The remaining contentions advanced by defendant were found to be without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate was nominated, by petition, as a candidate for a seat on a board of education. The voter commenced an action challenging her candidacy on the ground that she was ineligible under &sect; 2103(3) because her husband was already a member of that board. The trial court sustained the voter's challenge. The candidate appealed from that decision, which was affirmed. Section 2103(3) stated that no more than one member of a family could be a member of the same board of education in any school district. The court found that &sect; 2103(3) did not directly infringe upon the right to vote. Rather, &sect; 2103(3) only indirectly infringed upon that right by making a certain class of citizens ineligible for a public office. Therefore, the scope of review was limited to a determination of whether &sect; 2103(3) was rationally related to the promotion of a legitimate state interest. The court found that &sect; 2103(3) ensured that a board of education would be comprised of a wide cross-section of the community and that issues would be debated free from the inhibition that might exist because of an intimate relationship. Therefore, the court concluded that &sect; 2103(3) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with five felony counts of DWI. He pleaded guilty to two counts. Prior to sentencing, the trial court denied defense counsel's request to examine the presentence report based on the fact that it had declared N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 390.50(2)&nbsp;unconstitutional in a case earlier that morning. In imposing defendant's sentence, the trial court read from the presentence report. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's sentence. The state did not press the argument that &sect; 390.50(2) was unconstitutional. The court held that the disclosure provision of &sect; 390.50(2) was mandatory, subject to certain discretionary exceptions. If the report was not disclosed, a statement on the record of the reasons for the nondisclosure was required and appellate review was available.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent commissioner of the State Department of Social Services (commissioner) sought to compel appellant county officials to appropriate adequate funds for the administration of the home relief, aid to dependent children, medical assistance for needy persons and day care programs in the county under the Social Services Law. The Supreme Court (New York) granted the relief sought. The county officials appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county officials alleged that the 50 percent contribution ratio of the cost to provide aid, care, and support for the needy resulted in the imposition of local taxes in excess of the constitutional limit, violated the right of the county residents to effective self government and home rule, and resulted in a denial of equal protection and due process rights under the federal and state constitutions. The court held that the county officials did not assert or prove that they were taxing real property at the maximum allowable rate. The court held that although the law indirectly touched upon the concerns of individual localities and affected their resolution, the rights of individual counties to govern their local affairs must yield to the state's legislative authority. The court found that the concentration of one half of the non-federal cost at the local level rationally furthers the state's interest in providing the individual counties with a compelling incentive to administer the programs efficiently and to prevent abuses. Therefore, the challenged provisions were rationally related to effectuate the general policy concerning aid, care, and support of the needy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decision in favor of the commissioner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judgment granting a petition by the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Social Services to compel officials of Erie County to appropriate funds for the administration of home relief, aid to dependent children, medical assistance and day care programs in that county, as required by provisions of the Social Services Law, which obligate the county to provide 50% of the non-Federally reimbursed costs of those programs, is affirmed.  Absent evidence that the county is currently taxing real property at the maximum allowable rate, it cannot claim that the continued imposition of the 50% contribution rate upon it will force it to impose taxes in excess of the limit set by the New York State Constitution.  As to a claim by it that the continued imposition of that contribution rate interferes with its right to self government and home rule, the State Legislature may constitutionally abridge the right of local governments to home rule upon enactment of a valid general law, and the challenged statute, which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  applies with equal force to every local government within the State and attempts to regulate the nature and extent of State contribution to local welfare commitments, legitimately a matter of State-wide public concern, is such a general law. Nor does the continued imposition of the 50% contribution rate result in a denial of equal protection or of due process, since the 50% contribution system rationally furthers a legitimate, articulated State purpose and is rationally related to the effectuation of the general policy concerning the aid, care and support of the needy as contained in the New York State Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Sullivan County Court (New York), entered upon a jury verdict, convicting him of murder and attempted murder, N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 125.25(1) and 110.00.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder and attempted murder, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 125.25(1) and 110.00. When he testified at his trial, the prosecutor questioned him about his remaining silent when he was arrested. Defendant's attorney initially objected, but the objection was withdrawn. The prosecutor also impeached his credibility by asking defendant questions suggesting that his attorney had coached him and helped him fabricate an exculpatory story. Defendant was convicted and he appealed, assigning error to the cross-examination and claiming that the prosecutor had also made inflammatory statements during closing arguments. In affirming, the court noted that defendant had failed to make a contemporaneous objection to any of the assigned errors and ruled that the alleged errors did not irreparably taint the trial and were not so pervasive or prejudicial for the court to consider those points as a matter of discretion in the interests of justice. While commenting on any defendant's post-arrest silence was improper, that and the other errors were harmless. The proof of defendant's guilt was strong and his testimony lacked credibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed because defendant failed to preserve for appeal the issues of the prosecutor's improper questioning of him on cross-examination about his post-arrest silence and alleged inflammatory comments made during summation. The unobjected-to errors did not irreparably taint the trial such that they should nevertheless be reviewed in the interests of justice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- right to remain silent -- on cross-examination of defendant, where defense counsel failed to preserve for review question whether it was proper to use defendant's post-arrest silence to impeach his testimony, error did not so vary from lawful procedure that entire trial was irreparably tainted, thereby mandating reversal -- defendant's conviction may not be reversed on such error as matter of discretion in interest of justice since proof of guilt was strong, error only served to impeach incredible story, and impeachment impact of post-arrest silence was mild -- efforts to impeach defendant on cross-examination by asking how long defendant conferred with his attorney in preparing to testify did not violate his right to counsel -- defendant's conviction of murder and attempted murder is, accordingly, affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On cross-examination of defendant in a prosecution for murder and attempted murder, where defense counsel failed to preserve for review the question of whether&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it was proper to use defendant's post-arrest silence to impeach his testimony, the error did not so vary from lawful procedure that the entire trial was irreparably tainted, thereby mandating reversal. The erroneous cross-examination placed improper evidence before the jury, but it did not warp the rules of procedure by which the other evidence was to be evaluated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The conviction of defendant may not be reversed on such error as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice.  The proof of guilt was strong, the error only served to impeach what was very nearly an incredible story by defendant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ab initio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and the impeachment impact of defendant's post-arrest silence was mild.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The prosecutor's efforts to impeach defendant on cross-examinaion by asking how long he had conferred with his attorney in preparing to testify did not violate his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Comment on consultation with his attorney is permissible when it induces defendant to admit he was coached. However, even if it was improper for the prosecutor in summation to question defendant's credibility by pointing to a 4 1/2 hour session, such comment was harmless as it only tended to discredit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a story which could hardly be believed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. No objection was made to two other portions of the prosecutor's closing argument and they do not require reversal in the interest of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Accordingly, the judgment convicting defendant of murder and attempted murder should be affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was sentenced to an indeterminate term of one year to life after he pled guilty to the criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. The Board denied the prisoner parole after it conducted a hearing to determine whether he should be paroled after one year. The prisoner sought judicial review of the Board's decision. The trial court found that the Board had complied with the provisions governing parole proceedings and dismissed the matter. The prisoner sought review of that judgment, which was affirmed. Under N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 212(10), the Board's actions were not reviewable when done in accordance with the law. Therefore, the prisoner was not entitled to relief because the Board had fully complied with the statutory requirements. The court stated that the Board was not required by the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution to disclose its release criteria. Furthermore, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 7, &sect; 1910.15 adequately advised prisoners of the principal criteria for parole. Finally, the prisoner had failed to preserve the issue of whether a Board member had improperly acted as his interpreter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator's decedent was charged with gambling offenses; a search warrant was executed and currency was taken from his apartment. The charges were dismissed, but the police commissioner retained the seized money. The administrator filed a complaint seeking return of the money. The trial court granted the administrator's motion for summary judgment and denied the police commissioner's cross motion for dismissal of the complaint. The police commissioner contended that the complaint was defective because it failed to allege that a notice of claim prescribed by N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 50-e and N.Y. County Law &sect; 52 had been served upon him. The administrator contended that service of such a notice was not required. The court affirmed the trial court's order. The court reasoned that the complaint could be viewed as one for money had and received or for unjust enrichment; thus, the cause of action was equitable in nature. Where an action was grounded upon equitable principles, compliance with the notice of claim statutes was not needed. A fair sense of justice required that the police commissioner not be permitted to withhold money that rightfully belonged to the administrator.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In tax certiorari proceedings, respondent Board of Assessors of the County of Nassau is foreclosed from challenging the methodology and underlying data employed by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment (SBEA) in promulgating the State equalization rate under the holding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Guth Realty v Gingold</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (34 NY2d 440), which, upon an analysis of the 1969 amendment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to subdivision 3 of section 720 of the Real Property Tax Law, and a finding that the State equalization rate is &quot;objectively&quot; and &quot;expertly&quot; arrived at, determined that the State rate may be utilized as the sole basis for determining the ratio of assessed value to full value for the years 1970 forward.  While the taxing authority may, under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Guth</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, show that &quot;the equalization ratio is inappropriate to the taxing unit, to the category of property involved and to the particular property or any other valid reason which would affect its relevancy or weight&quot;, it may not challenge the methodology of the SBEA.  Proof on the methodology of the SBEA, although almost entirely inadmissible under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Guth</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, nevertheless, did not establish that the State rate was other than &quot;objectively&quot; and &quot;expertly&quot; arrived at.  Petitioners, which were challenging their real property assessments on grounds of inequality, satisfied their limited burden of having the State rate used as the sole determinant of ratio by producing a witness with a mathematical and statistical background, who testified to the general methodology employed in making up the equalization rate of the county after interviews with SBEA&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  officials and examination of supporting data and documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Special Term properly denied the county pretrial discovery of all of the raw data underlying some 2,000 appraisals and 6,000 sales by use of a subpoena duces tecum.  The county was granted a list of all appraisals and sales actually used in the pertinent surveys from which it could have discovered any serious discrepancies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The erroneous refusal by the SBEA to grant the county formal standing to represent the towns in hearings before the SBEA on tentative equalization rates for those towns did not render the State rates inadmissible per se since the State rate, if not stipulated to, cannot be applied without a prima facie showing that the collected data going into the rate formulation specifically pertained to the taxing unit in issue.  In addition, the county had standing to challenge the final State rates by way of an article 78 proceeding pursuant to section 760 of the Real Property Tax Law. Future challenges of individual assessing units suffering unique prejudice because of some peculiarity of the methodology of the SBEA should be made in the statutorily provided hearings before the SBEA and not in the courts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon a certiorari proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioners were properly awarded their reasonable costs and expenses in making proof of ratio pursuant to subdivision 2 of section 716 of the Real Property Tax Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The county is collaterally estopped from challenging the SBEA methodology in pending certiorari proceedings.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant individual was the target of a narcotics investigation and was under police surveillance. An eavesdropping warrant was obtained. A search warrant was obtained and executed about three weeks later. Narcotics as well as cutting and packaging paraphernalia were seized.

The trial court denied the motion, and defendant pleaded guilty to attempted possession of a dangerous drug in the first degree and was sentenced to an indeterminate term prison term. Execution of the sentence was stayed pending defendant's appeal. The court reversed the judgment and the orders denying the suppression of evidence, granted the motion to suppress, and dismissed the indictment, as the eavesdropping warrant was improperly issued because the police failed to prove, as required by N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action to declare that a loan from defendant, a licensed lender, to plaintiffs payable monthly over three years is void under section 358 of the Banking Law is subject to the three-year Statute of Limitations ( CPLR 214, subd 2).  Section 358, which provides that any loan in the making of which any act shall have been done constituting a misdemeanor shall be void and the lender shall have no right to collect principal or interest, is a State statute pre-existing the State and Federal Truth in Lending Acts. Although defendant failed to furnish plaintiffs with items required to be disclosed under the Federal act, the one-year Statute of Limitations in the Federal act applicable to actions to recover civil penalties does not govern the present action.  The Legislature did not intend to subject actions under section 358 to multiple Statutes of Limitations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiffs do not have a right to judgment for all payments&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of principal and interest voluntarily made on the loan.  Such an action was not recognized at common law and section 358 of the Banking Law establishes no such remedy.  The statute creates a defense for the borrower in an action by the lender where disclosure requirements of section 353 have not been met and, since it deprives the lender of the right to collect, it must be strictly construed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A claim by plaintiffs, for payments made after the institution of the action and under a reservation of rights and without prejudice, may bear on the issue of voluntariness and requires exploration and to that extent plaintiffs' first cause of action is reinstated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The failure of the Legislature to incorporate into section 353 of the Banking Law the specific provisions of the Federal act and regulations is not violative of section 16 of article III of the State Constitution, which states that no act shall be passed which shall provide that existing law shall be made part of said act except by inserting it in such act.  The bill amending section 353 was recommended by the State Banking Department (NY Const, art III, &sect; 21).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Being aware of the conduct that it was requiring of licensed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lenders, the Legislature exercised, rather than delegated, its legislative function when it subjected them to penalties.  Furthermore to the extent that incorporation by reference is to existing law and regulations applicable to citizens of this State, it is a permissible legislative device.  </SPAN></P>

The executive order prohibited those officers and employees from engaging in any other public or private employment, from serving as director or officer of any profit-making corporation, and from serving as an officer of any political party or political organization. The trial court found that the order was unconstitutional as construed and applied, and denied the governor's and others' cross motion for summary judgment.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Executive Order No. 10 of 1975 (9 NYCRR 3.10), which requires State employees in policy-making positions or earning $ 30,000 or more in exempt, noncompetitive or unclassified positions in departments, the head of which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is appointed by the Governor, to file financial disclosure statements and prohibits such persons from engaging in any other public or private employment or serving as an officer of a profit-making corporation or a political party, is constitutional.  The Supreme Court has upheld similar political restrictions imposed by the Hatch Act as sufficiently narrow to achieve the legitimate purpose of curtailing partisan political activity among public employees without intruding upon areas of expression and association not substantially connected to such activity.  The Supreme Court has held that the government may require information based upon legitimate governmental concerns with respect to private financial transactions of public employees in the face of a claim of invasion of the right to privacy or specific constitutional guarantees.  The Fifth Amendment does not protect reasonable expectations of privacy with respect to documents obtained without compulsion of self incriminatory testimony, and no assertion is made that disclosure under Executive Order No. 10 would tend to incriminate any persons covered by it.  Recent Supreme Court cases support the view that such disclosure does not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  violate the Fourth Amendment, and indicate that the salary limit, which would restrict application to only 700 persons, violates no constitutional provision.  The most compelling of State interests is the public right to relevant information concerning its government and its employees.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner argued that the government entity's zoning ordinance was an improper exercise of its police regulatory power and also deprived him of his fundamental right to travel and abide and thus violated the Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the Unites States Constitution. The court rejected the property owner's arguments and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court pointed out that the property owner failed to maintain his burden of proof that the government entity's zoning ordinance was clearly unreasonable and was not really designed to accomplish a legitimate purpose affecting public health, safety, morals or general welfare. The court also noted that the government entity's exclusion of mobile homes from certain areas within its boundaries did not violate the property owner's right to equal protection. The court concluded that the property owner had failed to establish that the government entity's actions in prohibiting a mobile home from being constructed on the property owner's premises violated the property owner's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-wife first instituted an action for divorce by personally serving the ex-husband with process in Texas, the state in which he resided. The ex-husband later commenced a divorce action in Texas. Following the enactment of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 302(b), the ex-wife commenced another divorce action in New York. New York was the state where the parties had resided for most of the marriage. The trial court enjoined the ex-husband from proceeding in Texas and denied a cross-motion to dismiss the portion of the complaint requesting in personam relief. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  CPLR 302 (subd [b]), which subjects a nonresident, nondomiciliary defendant to in personam jurisdiction in a matrimonial action without personal service in this State &quot;if the party seeking support is a resident of or domiciled in this State&quot; provided that this State &quot;was the matrimonial domicile of the parties before their separation&quot;, satisfies the mandate of constitutional due process.  Although married in Mississippi in 1953, both plaintiff wife and defendant husband were lifelong residents of New York until October, 1973 when defendant went to Texas where plaintiff served him personally with process in an action for divorce in November, 1974.  Plaintiff and three children born of the marriage continue to reside in this State.  Under such circumstances, the marriage of these parties has roots deeply embedded in New York.  The State's abiding interest in those of the family who remain as domiciliaries should not be cut off because a marital partner prefers another climate.  To permit defendant to circumvent obligations which had accrued during his long association with this State would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be repugnant to a rational concept of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant was properly enjoined pursuant to CPLR 6301 from prosecuting a Texas divorce action which he commenced in June, 1974.  A judgment of divorce in favor of defendant in Texas would violate &quot;plaintiff's rights respecting the subject of the action&quot; and would tend to render her New York judgment &quot;ineffectual&quot;.  A Texas decree, if procured before disposition of this New York case, could result in the dismissal of so much of plaintiff's action as seeks a divorce. Since the foreign decree will affect only the marital status, it would be duplicitous to allow defendant, who has the economic stability to protect his rights in New York, to pursue in Texas the same goal he may affirmatively achieve here in response to plaintiff's suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Workers' Comp. Law &sect; 16 granted death benefits to any surviving wife of a deceased male employee but restricted the availability of such benefits only to those surviving husbands who demonstrated dependency upon deceased female employees. The claimant, who could not demonstrate dependency upon his deceased wife, was therefore denied death benefits, and he appealed. The court held that &sect; 16 discriminates against the married woman whose employment contributed to the economic well-being of her family, whereas the working man was given the security of knowing that in the event of his work-related death, his widow would not suffer the loss of his entire income. The working woman was given no such guarantee. Section 16 compelled dissimilar treatment for both surviving husbands and working wives, respectively, vis-a-vis widows and working males. Such a sex-based differentiation could not be sustained. The dependency requirement applicable to husbands under &sect; 16 was unconstitutional. The Board, therefore, was required to award death benefits to surviving husbands on the same basis as such benefits were awarded to widows.</SPAN></P>

Such a sex-based differentiation cannot be sustained.  The statute commands dissimilar treatment for those similarly situated. The rationale that widows are entitled to a presumption of dependency to promote the public good by protecting workmen and their dependents not only admits of being discriminatory in purpose but also fails to convince when it appears that a substantial number of married women are not in fact dependent on their husbands for support.  The statute discriminates against the married woman whose employment contributes to the economic well-being of her family.  The differentiation rests on a generalization which has little relationship to present reality and cannot be tolerated under the Constitution.  It gives support to a philosophy which minimizes the importance of employment for women, thus using past discrimination as a justification for continuing to burden them as a class with economic disadvantages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant guardian of the illegitimate child challenged the decision of the New York County Surrogate's Court (New York), which held the term &quot;issue&quot; in a will had to be construed to exclude illegitimate grandchildren of an income beneficiary of a trust established under the terms of that will.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The will established a trust and provided that when the beneficiaries should die, his one-half share of the income should be paid for the remainder of the trust term &quot;to his issue.&quot; An heir died leaving two children, the infants represented by the guardian. The heir never married the mother of these children, nor was an order of filiation entered. Relying on precedent, the trial court ruled that the two illegitimate children could not inherit, and absent intention to the contrary, it could not be assumed that the testatrix intended illegitimate descendants as the object of her bounty. The guardian asserted that the change in conventional attitudes towards illegitimates, as reflected in statutes and decisions, would warrant a construction of the word &quot;issue&quot; as including illegitimates, in the absence of contrary intent to exclude them. The court held that, to the extent that precedents required this outcome, the law was not only outmoded, but also discriminatory and was to be rejected. The court held that the word &quot;issue&quot; had to be construed to refer to legitimate and illegitimate descendants alike in the absence of an express qualification by the testatrix.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decree of the trial court was unanimously reversed, on the law and on the facts, and upon a reading of the will, it was determined that the testatrix intended in her use of the word &quot;issue&quot; in her will legitimate and illegitimate descendants. The will was so construed.</SPAN></P>

One cousin died in 1965, survived by a daughter and a son, and the latter died in 1972, survived by two illegitimate children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Albany County Court (New York), which convicted him of criminally negligent homicide and assault in the second degree, claiming that he was denied his rights under the U.S. Const. and N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 30.30 to a speedy trial as a result of the approximately 41-month delay between the date of the indictment and the date of trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's trial was scheduled three months after his indictment but the prosecuting attorney requested an adjournment because a principal witness was being hospitalized. Two years later, defendant moved for a dismissal of the indictment based on the denial of a speedy trial. The trial court did not render a decision on his motion and after almost another year defendant again moved for dismissal. The trial court denied this motion, finding that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 30.30 had not been violated because the State was at all times ready to proceed, and a jury convicted defendant. On review, the court reversed, finding that &sect; 30.30 was inapplicable to the case and that the State had been formally put on notice by defendant's first motion that he was not acquiescing in any delay and was insisting upon his right to a speedy trial. The prosecution made no attempt to have the case tried and offered no excuse for the denial of defendant's right to a speedy trial. The only excuse offered by the trial court for the delay was calendar congestion, which might have excused the delay prior to defendant's first motion, but offered no excuse when a reasonable time passed after the motion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's trial, at which he was found guilty of criminally negligent homicide and assault, commenced on January 7, 1975, approximately 41 months after the date of his indictment on July 29, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1971.  The case was set for trial in October, 1971, but was adjourned to the November Term on the request of the prosecuting attorney because a principal witness was scheduled to enter the hospital.  Defendant was thereupon released from custody. By a motion returnable in November, 1973, defendant moved for a dismissal of the indictment upon the ground that he had been denied a speedy trial and requested a dismissal of charges pursuant to CPL 30.30.  The court did not render a decision on the speedy trial motion and so defendant moved again by motion returnable in September, 1974, which motion was denied by the court in a decision rendered December 31, 1974.  Although no particular time of delay will require a dismissal, a delay of 44 months from arrest in this action, in the absence of a showing of facts which establish that the delay was compatible with the sound administration of justice, is upon its face a patent frustration of the right to a speedy trial. Where a court makes no response to a motion based upon a denial of the right to a speedy trial and where the prosecution makes no apparent attempt to have the case tried, aside from marking it &quot;ready&quot;, the net effect is a denial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the only procedural device a defendant has to secure his right in the court where the criminal charges are pending.  No excuse was offered by the prosecution for this denial of defendant's right and while calendar congestion might be some excuse prior to the first motion, it offers no excuse when a reasonable time passes after the motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  CPL 30.30, which would have required the commencement of a trial within six months, is not applicable to this situation since it expressly exempts from its provisions charges relating to violations of Penal Law sections that were charged in the indictment. Furthermore, this statute was expressly made applicable only to actions commenced on or after May 1, 1972.  </SPAN></P>

Finally, the court stated, the record clearly demonstrated that the trial court informed defendant prior to sentencing that the minimum sentence would be imposed unless the district attorney recommended special treatment pursuant to N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 410.00 of the Penal Law, pursuant to which motion picture projectors, reels of film and other items were seized upon warrants from a motion picture theatre operated by plaintiff, is unconstitutional on its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  face.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the judgment from the Supreme Court, Bronx County (New York), which convicted them, upon their pleas of guilty, of the crime of obstructing governmental administration, and sentenced each of them to probation and a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed that it was the custom and practice in the county systematically and intentionally to mail qualification notices to prospective jurors based upon a fixed mathematical formula that specifically discriminated against women. They claimed that a substantially greater number of such qualification notices were sent to men than to women with the result that substantially more men than women were qualified for service. The court held that: (1) defendants' pleas of guilty did not waive their possible challenges to the constitutionality of N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 598; (2) however, because &sect; 598 had a rational basis it withstood their constitutional challenge; (3) defendants' right to appeal following their guilty plea was governed by statute; and (4) because the record contained no persuasive evidence that would mandate judicial inquiry, the court declined to extend itself to decide constitutional issues. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments rendered by the trial court, which convicted defendants of obstructing governmental administration following their pleas of guilty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grand Jury -- disqualification of public employees -- where defendants, indicted for opening drawbridges during strike, pleaded guilty and were convicted of obstructing governmental administration, judgments are affirmed; by their pleas of guilty defendants did not waive constitutional challenge to section 598 of Judiciary Law -- section 598 of Judiciary Law, which disqualifies from Grand Jury service public employees earning in excess of $ 1,000 annually, has rational basis and is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- hearing on methods used to impanel Grand Jury which returned indictments is not warranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants were employed by the City of New York as bridge tenders.  In furtherance of a plan conceived by their union to maximize disruption during a strike by municipal employees, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  each defendant opened his drawbridge, removed electrical equipment so that the bridge could not be closed, and left his post.  Indicted by the Bronx County Grand Jury, defendants subsequently pleaded guilty and were convicted of obstructing governmental administration (Penal Law, &sect; 195.05).  The judgments are affirmed.  By their pleas of guilty, defendants did not waive a challenge to the constitutionality of section 598 of the Judiciary Law. Such challenge was timely raised prior to the entry of the guilty pleas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 598 of the Judiciary Law, which disqualifies from Grand Jury service public employees earning in excess of $ 1,000 annually, has a rational basis and is not unconstitutional.  The fact that public service employees may serve on petit juries and in certain instances on Grand Juries in this State, negates any suggestion that section 598 rests on an assumption of bias inhering in public service employees merely by nature of their employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A hearing on the methods used to impanel the Grand Jury which returned the indictments is not warranted.  There is no support in the record for the statements attributed to the County Clerk of Bronx County that it was the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  practice in that county to systematically and intentionally mail qualification notices to prospective jurors based on a mathematical formula which discriminated against women with the result that substantially more men than women were qualified for service.  Nor can a stipulation by the District Attorney that the County Clerk engaged in a practice of summoning fewer women than men for jury qualification be equated with a practice of &quot;systematic exclusion and discrimination&quot; sufficient to make a factual showing that the Grand Jury was constituted illegally.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company manufactured coin-operated locks. It brought this action to declare unconstitutional a law that prohibited pay toilets on certain real estate. The trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that the statute was not invalid due to vagueness. The court held that the standard was one of reasonableness, and that the court would apply the plain meaning of the statute's language in its interpretation. In applying the usual standards of statutory construction, the court ruled that it was possible to determine that the pay toilet prohibited by the act meant one in which there was a direct charge for access to a stall in order to eliminate human waste. The statute was presumed to be a valid legislative act, and the court held that the company had not met its burden to overturn that presumption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- pay toilet facilities -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 399-a of General Business Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, prohibiting operation of pay toilet facilities on real property, is constitutional; plaintiffs do not occupy real property where they operate pay toilet facilities and, accordingly, lack standing to argue that they have been denied equal protection and that penalty language of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is unconstitutionally vague -- term &quot;pay toilet facilities&quot; is not so ambiguous that it cannot be determined what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> prohibits -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is valid exercise of police power and bears reasonable relation to its assumed object of increasing toilet accessibility -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> does not deprive plaintiffs of their property without due process of law -- preliminary injunction is vacated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 399-a of the General Business Law (L 1975, ch 666), which prohibits the operation of pay toilet&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  facilities on real property, is constitutional.  Plaintiffs are corporations that manufacture equipment suitable for installation on doors which they lease to the owners or tenants of real property who provide toilet facilities to their customers or the general public. Since plaintiffs do not occupy real property where they operate pay toilet facilities, they are not subject to the penalty feature of the statute, and, accordingly, do not have standing to argue that they have been denied equal protection or to assert that the penalty language of the statute is unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The term &quot;pay toilet facilities&quot; is not so ambiguous that it cannot be determined what the statute prohibits.  One commonly understands a &quot;pay toilet&quot; to mean an immediate charge for the singular use of a closet for the discharge of human waste.  While the term &quot;pay toilet facilities&quot; might contemplate a somewhat broader field of services for which immediate payment is required, these plaintiffs have not overcome the strong presumption of constitutionality favoring a statute enacted by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statute is a valid exercise of the police power and bears a reasonable relation to its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  assumed object of increasing toilet accessibility. Whether better means might have been selected or whether this statute fails of its desired purpose is not the concern of the court in resolving this phase of the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Since the statute is a valid exercise of police power, it does not deprive plaintiffs of their property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The preliminary injunction enjoining operation of the statute is vacated. </SPAN></P>

The former employee's &quot;resignation&quot; was based on his absence for 10 days without leave. The court held that the former state employee's petition was not time-barred. According to the court, because the former state employee was discharged without a hearing, the former state employee was not required to seek reinstatement without four months form discharge but could delay until such time as he demanded reinstatement and was refused. The court held that the former state employee initiated the instant proceeding 10 days prior to the expiration of 4 months from the date of his demand for reinstatement. The court also held that &sect; 5.3(d) was unconstitutional because it deprived the former state employee of due process.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, a civil service employee with permanent status, was advised by letter dated December 26, 1974 that, as he had neither reported for work since December 11, 1974 nor offered any explanation for his absence, his &quot;resignation&quot; was accepted effective December 10, 1974 (4 NYCRR 5.3 [d]).  An article 78 proceeding commenced June 10, 1975 to review the termination of petitioner's employment was not barred by the four-month Statute of Limitations ( CPLR 217).  Petitioner was discharged without a hearing or there was an acceptance of a resignation which he had never offered.  Accordingly, petitioner was not required to seek reinstatement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  within four months of discharge but could delay until his demand for reinstatement had been refused.  His demand by letter of February 20, 1975 for reinstatement was not answered and, therefore, the commencement of the proceeding was 10 days prior to the expiration of four months from the date of his demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The two-month delay in the demand for reinstatement did not constitute laches, especially since there was no answer to petitioner's letter demanding reinstatement. The delay was not unduly long or one calculated to prejudice the respondent employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 5.3 (d) of the Rules and Regulations of the Department of Civil Service (4 NYCRR 5.3 [d]), which provides that when an employee is absent without leave and without explanation for 10 work days &quot;such absence shall be deemed to constitute a resignation effective on the date of the commencement of such absence&quot;, is unconstitutional insofar as respondent applied it to petitioner.  The section, in effect, created an irrebuttable presumption insofar as petitioner was never given an opportunity to explain his absence in a hearing.  Petitioner's civil service employment is a thing of substantial value in which petitioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has a property interest, i.e., a protected interest under the due process clause of the Constitution.  Respondent could not deprive petitioner of that interest without affording him his rights of notice and an opportunity for a hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioner is reinstated effective December 10, 1974 with back pay.  </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 78, petitioner taxpayer sought review of a determination from respondent State Tax Commission (New York), which denied the taxpayer's application for redetermination of New York personal income tax.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a partner in a New York law firm who worked in Washington D.C., sought to apportion income from the law firm according to the number of days the taxpayer was working in New York. However, the Commission attributed this income to New York sources on the same basis utilized by the law partnership in allocating the distributive share of each partner according to the proportion that partnership net income from sources outside New York bore to partnership net income from all sources. Consequently, the taxpayer received a notice of deficiency, and when the taxpayer's application for redetermination was denied, the taxpayer filed an N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding. In upholding the Commission's denial, the court held the Commission had properly rejected the taxpayer's method of allocation for two reasons. First, the court held there was an insufficient showing that the percentage of time spent in New York had any relation to the distributive share of partnership income received during the tax year. Second, the court held it was the portion of the distributive share attributable to New York sources, not the value of personal services, which was subject to taxation.</SPAN></P>

The special information required by that section is in the nature of a bill of particulars, and a plea of guilty is a waiver of a failure to provide a bill of particulars.  Moreover, defendant did not plead guilty to any count in the indictment, but to a lesser, almost hypothetical crime, and, therefore, the validity of the original counts is no longer material.  The record indicates that the parties had agreed that he would plead to an E felony, and it was the merest chance that this particular one was chosen.  The failure to file the special information should not invalidate the plea bargain which he, the District Attorney and the court knowingly made, and certainly he should not unilaterally be given a better bargain. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, Board of the Jones Beach State Parkway Authority and bank trustee, and defendants, governor and attorney general, sought review of an order from the Supreme Court, in Albany County (New York), which declared N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 153-c(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional, enjoined the enforcement thereof, and declared all other provisions of that section constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board challenged a decision of the trial court which held that &sect; 153-c(1) was unconstitutional but that other provisions of the statute relating to a 120-day waiting period were constitutional. On appeal, the court held that the trial court correctly concluded that the 10-cent rollback provision constituted an unwarranted impairment of the state's pledge to bondholders as provided in N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 158-a(1). Because there was no allusion to any traffic emergency contained in N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 153-c, and the effect of the statute merely postponed the toll increase for 120 days, after which time presumably traffic would again become congested, it could not be said that the legislation was enacted to alleviate the traffic situation, nor that the toll rollback provision was reasonably related or appropriate to that end, even if such legislative intent did exist. The court held that because other provisions did not impair the obligation to the bondholders in any degree, there was no occasion for trial court to attempt to justify what it found to be a technical impairment caused by the exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 153-c of the Public Authorities Law, which was enacted after the Jones Beach State Parkway Authority had raised the toll on the Southern State Parkway from 10 cents to 25 cents, rolled back that toll to 10 cents and established procedures to be followed prior to any future toll increases, including the submission to the Comptroller of a detailed report, not less than 120 days prior to the effective date of the proposed increase, explaining its necessity, the publication by the Comptroller of his recommendations concerning the increase within 60 days, the holding of a public hearing not less than 15 days prior to the effective date of the proposed increase, the subsequent reconsideration by the Authority of the proposed increase, and then the taking of such action as the Authority deemed necessary and advisable.  The provision&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  therein for the toll rollback was properly held unconstitutional, and the other provisions therein were properly held constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The rollback provision constitutes an unwarranted impairment of a pledge made by the State to the Authority's bondholders, contained in section 158-a (subd 1) of the Public Authorities Law, that it will not limit or alter the rights of the Authority to collect revenues and fix appropriate tolls. Nor may the impairment be justified as a reasonable exercise of the State's police power, to alleviate traffic congestion on local streets resulting from motorists' attempting to avoid paying the toll increase on the parkway, since the legislation was not enacted to alleviate the traffic situation, nor was it reasonably related to that end.  And a claim that the statute was intended to remedy an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ultra vires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> act on the part of the Authority in increasing the toll can have no relevancy to an action concerning its constitutionality.  Furthermore, since review of an allegedly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ultra vires</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> act would properly be the subject of an article 78 proceeding, and is not a legislative function, it could not serve to justify the impairment of a contractual obligation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3. The remaining provisions of section 153-c, the disclosure provisions, do not impair the State's contractual obligation to the Authority's bondholders. They make it clear that the Authority still retains ultimate and unfettered power to determine toll charges and that its rights to perform its duties are not altered, nor can it be said that the security of the bondholders is impaired thereby.  As is apparent from the stated legislative findings which accompanied recent legislation ( Public Authorities Law, &sect; 2504), which becomes effective July 1, 1976, and which makes the same disclosure procedures applicable to all toll increases for all public authorities, they were enacted for the purpose of requiring a full and public disclosure of the financial status and the need for additional revenues, to indicate the soundness of the internal process of public authorities and to help gain public acceptance for a necessary toll increase. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state officials sought review of the decisions of the Supreme Court, Albany County that, in two separate cases, declared 1975 N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations challenged a statute, 1975 N.Y. Laws 460, that allowed the state officials to increase allowances for certain legislative officers and to provide allowances for new legislative offices for which no allowances were authorized. The lower court found the statute was unconstitutional because it allowed the legislature to increase its own salary and ordered that the legislative officials make restitution for the illegal amount paid. The court affirmed the finding that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 6, however, it modified that portion of the order that required restitution.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- legislative allowances -- chapter 460 of Laws of 1975 violates section 6 of article III of New York Constitution, which prohibits increases in allowances or salaries</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> during elective term of member of Legislature; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> conferring upon legislative body power to fix own salaries should be strictly construed against such power; if initial fixing of allowances were allowed each year, allowances and, accordingly, salaries could be fixed twice for each term in violation of Constitution, while burden of predicting needs of incoming Legislature for additional services does not outweigh danger of allowing legislators to fix own salaries -- restitution of allowances received prior to suit is not warranted in interests of fairness and justice, while those allowances received subsequently should be returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 460 of the Laws of 1975 violates section 6 of article III of the New York State Constitution. The &quot;payments in lieu of expenses&quot; provided by such statute are actually compensation to members of the Legislature for services rendered, immediately applicable to legislators whose terms began in 1975, and therefore conflict with the constitutional prohibition against any increase in allowances or salaries during a legislator's elective term.  A statute conferring upon a legislative body the power to fix its own salaries should be strictly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  construed and, unless clearly and unmistakably provided, the power will be denied.  No distinction is made in the Constitution between allowances and salaries, and to construe its provisions to allow an initial fixing of allowances at the beginning of each year would logically require that there be two initial fixing of allowances during an elective term, with the same result obtaining with respect to salaries, absent section 5 of the Legislative Law, in direct violation of the Constitution.  Although the prohibition against increases in allowances requires that the Legislature predict the needs of the incoming Legislature for additional services, there have been only eight new standing committees formed since 1949, and the burden of such prediction does not outweigh the dangers of allowing legislators to fix their own compensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Restitution of allowances received prior to the commencement of suit is not warranted in the interests of fairness and justice when the reliance placed upon the funds by the legislators is weighed against the constitutional harm of allowing the payments.  Allowances paid after commencement of the proceedings should be returned.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff national bank, on its behalf and on behalf of all similar note holders, challenged the judgment of the Supreme Court of New York County (New York), which granted summary judgment to defendants, the State of New York and the Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York, and declared that the New York State Emergency Moratorium Act for the City of New York (EMA), 1975 N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The EMA provided for a three-year moratorium on enforcement of outstanding short-term obligations of the City of New York conditioned upon an offer to exchange the short-term obligations with a replacement obligation having a date of maturity no more than 20 years after the date of maturity of the short-term obligation. The bank claimed, inter alia, that the EMA was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court disagreed. The EMA was not a law impairing the obligation of contracts violative of U.S. Const. art I, &sect; 10 because it only established a revised schedule for payment of the obligations. The EMA did not violate N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 2, 10, 12, because the city pledged its faith and credit for payment of its obligations and the city had not violated the strictures of &sect;&sect; 10 and 12 relating to the city's power to levy real estate taxes. The interest rate of 6 percent was not confiscatory because it was double that available on any other judgment or accrued claim against the city under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 3-a.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The controversy which gave rise to these proceedings arose from the failure of the association, the recognized bargaining agent for the city's firefighters, and the city to reach an agreement over the terms of an employment contract.

After a hearing, the panel awarded the association one additional holiday and wage increases, but it rejected most of the other union demands. The court affirmed. The court found that the trial court erred in concluding that N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 213 provided for review of a public arbitration panel's award under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 rather than N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. CPLR article 75 is the proper vehicle for review of a binding determination of a public arbitration panel in a public employment dispute.  Although article 78 and article 75, as extended to meet the requirements of due process in a compulsory arbitration case, have virtually the same standards for review, an article 78 proceeding would be brought against either the panel, which does not have the means to defend its award, or the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB), which neither reviewed nor approved the panel's determination.  An article 75&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proceeding would allow the real adversaries to protect their own interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 213 of the Civil Service Law, which provides for article 78 review of PERB orders, is inapplicable to review of a public arbitration panel award, since the award is not an order of PERB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an article 75 proceeding to review a compulsory arbitration, the court must determine whether the award is supported by evidence or other basis in reason appearing in the record and is not arbitrary or capricious. According to such review standard, the panel properly considered the ability of the employer to pay a salary increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In view of its failure to make a timely request therefor, in accordance with PERB rules, the petitioner city had no right to a transcript of testimony before the panel, and, in any event, the city was not prejudiced, since the record contains a sufficient basis for affirmance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. PERB fully complied with its duty to supply a list of qualified, disinterested persons to serve as panel members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Accordingly, the order and judgment confirming the award should be affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On November 26, 1973 petitioner had submitted for filing with the Attorney-General an offering plan for the conversion of three quadrants of its apartment complex to a condominium, and, when he refused to act on the plan, because of the pendency of litigation concerning his acceptance of an offering plan to convert the fourth quadrant to a condominium, petitioner commenced an article 78 proceeding to compel him to act, and, in 1974, obtained a judgment in its favor, which was affirmed by the Appellate Division and by the Court of Appeals.  During the pendency of the appeals, chapter 1021 of the Laws of 1974 was enacted, amending section 352-e of the General Business Law to provide that no offering plan could become effective unless 35% of the tenants in occupancy agreed to purchase their apartments. When, following the completion of the appellate process, petitioner requested that its offering plan, as updated, be reviewed in accordance with the 1974 judgment, the Attorney-General refused to review it, solely on the ground that it did not contain a statement in conformity with the new &quot;35% requirement&quot;.  Petitioner then moved for a supplemental judgment in the 1973&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proceeding, directing him to review the plan in accordance with the law in effect on November 26, 1973, or, alternatively, declaring the new law unconstitutional.  Special Term severed its motion from the 1973 proceeding, treated it as a separate article 78 proceeding, and directed the Attorney-General to review the offering plan in accordance with the law in effect on November 26, 1973.  Its judgment is modified, by deleting the reference to a severance and treatment of the motion as a separate article 78 proceeding, and, as so modified, is affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Dispositive of the merits is the rule that a negligent or a willful delay by a governmental agency, which prevents the issuance of a license until after the amendment of the governing statute, will afford grounds for applying the pre-existing law.  And nothing in the legislative history of chapter 1021 of the Laws of 1974 suggests retroactive application either to filings pending in the office of the Attorney-General or to plans that had not yet become effective though already accepted for filing prior to the statute's effective date.  Petitioner's attempt to update its plan and prospectus does not warrant a conclusion that a fresh&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  filing was engaged in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. No jurisdictional basis existed for treating petitioner's motion as an independent application for relief.  The direction sought by it to the effect that the Attorney-General apply the law in existence on November 26, 1973 is fully compatible with and implemental of the prior judgment.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties executed a separation agreement that contained a non-merger clause regarding any future divorce suit, and provided that the wife would not seek or accept any judgment or decree granting her alimony. The wife withdrew her action at trial and the trial court entered judgment in favor of the husband on a conversion no fault basis under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 170(6). The wife filed a motion to set aside the separation agreement. Both parties testified as to their respective financial resources and expenses on the issue of alimony. The husband urged the validity of the separation agreement and the enforceability of the waiver of alimony. The court held that the agreement properly supplied grounds for divorce under &sect; 170(6) because such agreements survived for that purpose and alimony could have properly been established. However, the court held that the award of alimony was excessive as it left the husband with resources that were barely sufficient to meet his current living costs. The court reduced the alimony but did not disturb the order that the husband pay the medical, dental and hospital expenses of the wife.</SPAN></P>

The board, appointed pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3020-a, then dismissed the teacher and ordered that the dismissal was retroactive to the date of suspension. The teacher appealed, arguing that &sect; 3020-a was unconstitutional, that the decision of the board was not supported by substantial evidence, that the suspension without pay was illegal, and that the penalty imposed was excessive. The court modified the board's determination by annulling the findings of child abuse and the failure to adhere to school regulations and by reducing the penalty imposed. Substantial evidence did not exist to support the charges of child abuse and failure to adhere to regulations, but substantial evidence existed to support the finding of the lack of professionalism on the part of the teacher.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Following hearings conducted before a panel appointed pursuant to section 3020-a of the Education Law, a school board dismissed a tenured teacher charged with abuse of school children, failure to adhere to school regulations or to obey specific instructions given by superiors, and incompetence and lack of professionalism in his conduct as a teacher. The board's determination is modified, by annulling so much thereof as sustained the first two charges and by reducing the penalty imposed to suspension for three months without pay.  As to the first charge, excessive use of force could be an independent charge as to an allegation of a crime, but the record is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lacking in substantial evidence that the teacher committed such a crime.  The second charge refers to his alleged use of physical force in disciplining his students and his keeping children after school, but, even assuming he did so, there is no evidence that the board ever adopted the regulations allegedly violated thereby or that any valid directives containing specific instructions were not obeyed by him.  The conduct complained of in the third charge, such as his alleged lack of planning and failure to handle minor disciplinary matters by himself, does appear to fit within the definitions of causes for removal set forth in section 3012 of the Education Law, and the board's findings relative thereto are supported by substantial evidence. However, in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, and particularly the relatively minor transgressions specified in the third charge, the dismissal of the teacher would be unfair and is unjustified.</SPAN></P>

Section 3020-a does not authorize the withholding of pay during a period of suspension, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the teacher was plainly entitled to be paid until the date of his dismissal, but, instead, his compensation ceased as of an earlier date and his dismissal was made retroactive to the date he was originally suspended.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The teacher also contends that the board's decision was not made solely on the record adduced before the hearing panel. However, although two board members were present in the principal's office when the board's attorney talked with students about the complaints against the teacher, neither member questioned any of the children, and the board's decision states that it made its determination based solely upon the evidence adduced on the record.  No showing was made that this was not the case.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs tenants sought review of the decision of the order of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Kings County (New York), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants to the extent of declaring that the N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contented that the appointment of hearing officers to hear and determine summary proceedings pursuant to N.Y. City Civ. Ct. Act &sect; 110(e) violated N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 15, that provided that Civil Court of the City of New York had jurisdiction over summary proceedings to recover possession of real property. The court noted that under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 4317(b) compulsory reference to a referee could be ordered by the court only where trial required examination of a long account, including actions to foreclose mechanic's liens, or to determine an issue of damages separately triable and not requiring a trial by jury. The court stated that no state constitutional provisions curtailed the power of the legislature to provide for compulsory reference except that compulsory references could not violate rights guaranteed to the parties by the constitution, such as a right to a trial by jury where the right existed. Therefore the court held that because the parties waived a trial by jury, there was no impediment to a compulsory reference to a hearing officer to hear and determine the issues, even if all of the parties to the litigation objected to the reference.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The appointment of hearing officers to hear and determine summary proceedings does not violate section 15 of article VI of the New York State Constitution.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The hearing officers authorized by section 110 are in essence referees, for referees are the only nonjudicial officers who exercise judicial functions.  It is well established that the Legislature may, by statute, provide for compulsory references in certain types of cases, and there is no constitutional limitation upon its power in this regard except that compulsory references may not violate constitutionally guaranteed rights, such as the right to a trial by jury.  Where the parties have waived a jury trial, there is no impediment to a compulsory reference to a hearing officer to hear and determine the issues, even if all the parties to the litigation object.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  CPLR article 43, which governs references in the Supreme Court, applies in the Civil Court only in those instances where procedure in that court is not otherwise regulated by provisions of the New York City Civil Court Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a hearing, respondent Commissioner of Health (commissioner) revoked the operating license of petitioner convalescent home (home).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For 23 years the nursing home operated under state license. However, the state revoked the license due primarily to alleged structural defects relating to fire safety. N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2800 empowered the department to develop and administer the state's policies towards hospitals and related services. But the state legislature set no particular standards for the department to follow. The court held that &sect; 2800 was unconstitutional because it attempted to delegate to the department authority to determine standards and policies for the relevant services. Thus, the legislature unconstitutionally delegated its authority. Moreover, even if the department had proper authority to develop its own regulations to interpret and apply &sect; 2800, its regulations were arbitrary. The regulations did not inform a party what was expected. For example, the regulations allowed modification by the department of any and all the requirements found in the regulations. The regulations were promulgated, interpreted, and applied by the same department that acted as prosecutor, judge, and jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient alleged that she was blinded after birth due to the hospital's negligence. The hospital contended that the patient's action, which was commenced when she was 22 years of age, was barred by the statute of limitations because the patient's disability of infancy had terminated when she attained the age of 18 years and, thus, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 208, her action for medical malpractice had to be commenced within three years after her 18th birthday. The court held that the patient had timely commenced her action because she was entitled to rely upon the original version of C.P.L.R. 208 and, thus, to invoke the disability of infancy until she was 21 years of age. The court found that because the patient had already attained the age of 21 years when the amendment to C.P.L.R. 208 became effective, the result of adopting the hospital's theory would be analogous to the unconstitutional act of shortening a statute of limitations without affording an aggrieved plaintiff a reasonable opportunity to commence suit and would create the anomalous result of requiring the patient to have commenced her action prior to the enactment of the amendments in question.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Minimum Period of Required Residency of Family Member of Deceased Rent-Stabilized Tenant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) &sect; 2523.5(b) (2), which provides that if a tenant is deceased at the expiration of the lease term, such tenant's family member who has not resided in the housing accommodation since the inception of the tenancy or the commencement of the relationship, but who has been residing with such tenant in the housing accommodation as a primary resident for a period of no less than two years immediately prior to the death of the tenant, shall be entitled to a renewal lease, does not violate the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses of the State Constitution.  The regulation meets the test of rationality in that the time frame chosen is reasonably related to the goal of limiting succession rights to those family members who can demonstrate that they lived with the tenant of record for at least some minimum period of measurable duration.  The fact that there may conceivably be a disproportionate impact upon surviving family members who moved in with the tenant during the tenant's final illness (whatever that illness might be) does not in and of itself make out invidious discrimination forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause, nor does it raise an issue of independent constitutional significance.  Thus, the regulation is not unconstitutional as written or as applied to respondents, the mother and sister of the deceased rent-stabilized tenant, who moved into the subject premises to assist the tenant, who was suffering from AIDS, and lived with him for approximately 18 months until his death.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a holdover summary proceeding to recover possession of the subject premises from respondent, the son of the deceased tenant of record, respondent's affirmative defense that petitioner's failure to properly offer his mother a renewal lease entitled him to remain in possession after the January 31, 1985 expiration of her last renewal lease and after her death is no longer viable since, even deeming such renewal lease to have been executed by her, it would have expired on January 31, 1987.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a holdover summary proceeding to recover possession of the subject premises from respondent, the son of the deceased tenant of record, respondent's affirmative defense and counterclaim, based upon a claim of harassment, must fail; a bona fide dispute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  exists as to respondent's entitlement to remain in possession of the premises after the death and expiration of the last renewal lease of the tenant of record.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The provisions of the new Rent Stabilization Code (eff May 1, 1987) which authorize succession to rent-stabilized premises by family members in case of death or vacatur of the tenant of record (Rent Stabilization Code [9 NYCRR] &sect; 2523.5 [b] [1], [2]) are invalid.  There is a patent inconsistency between the Rent Stabilization Law (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 26-501 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which forecloses succession rights, and the succession provisions of the new code.  Further, inasmuch as the succession provisions of the new code impair and diminish the existing rights of owners by requiring them to offer renewal leases to persons other than tenants of record where previously landlords were under no obligation to do so, these provisions violate the proscription against impairment or diminishment of existing rights contained in the Rent Stabilization&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Law (Administrative Code &sect; 26-511 [b]); thus, the succession provisions exceed the limited scope of the authority granted by the Legislature to the Commissioner of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal to amend the code.  Further, the succession provisions of the new code constitute a breach of the separation of powers doctrine in that they represent an unconstitutional intrusion into the exclusive domain of the Legislature by an administrative agency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. When a defendant moves for resentencing upon a claimed inability to pay fines imposed, the court must hold an evidentiary hearing to ascertain the validity of the claim, and if it is found that defendant is unable to pay the fine despite good-faith efforts to do so, the court may not automatically convert the fine into a prison sentence but must first consider alternative measures of punishment other than imprisonment. Accordingly, judgments imposing concurrent jail sentences upon defendant for failure to pay fines imposed upon separate convictions are reversed where defendant was rearrested for failure to pay said fines, defense counsel requested that defendant be resentenced because he was unable to pay the fines due to indigency, and the court, without inquiry, sentenced defendant to said concurrent terms of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Before an indigent defendant who fails to pay a fine may be resentenced to imprisonment as punishment for the crime, all other available alternative dispositions must be considered and rejected by the sentencing court as insufficient to satisfy the penological interests of the State.  Accordingly, CPL 420.10 (subd 4), which permits incarceration of a defendant who is financially unable to pay a fine, is not unconstitutional since it permits the court to consider all available sentencing alternatives and does not mandate imprisonment. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a court must permit defense counsel to deliver a summation in a nonjury trial upon an indictment ( CPL 320.20, subd 3, par [c]), a court sitting without a jury still possesses the discretion to allow or disallow summations in a trial upon a simplified traffic information ( CPL 350.10, subd 3, par [c]) since traffic or petty offense cases which do not entail a &quot;real likelihood&quot; or a &quot;practical possibility&quot; of incarceration may not require adherence to exacting standards designed to fully safeguard a defendant's constitutional rights as do those cases in which a sentence of incarceration may well be imposed.  In view of the availability of statutory remedies to the defendant in the event of her inability to pay the $ 35 fine imposed for speeding ( CPL 420.10, subd 4), the sentence imposed did not entail a &quot;real likelihood&quot; of imprisonment and she was therefore not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  denied the right to assistance of counsel by the failure of the court to allow her attorney to deliver a summation or make closing arguments. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 3 of Westchester County Local Law No. 9 of the Local Laws of 1974, which prohibits the posting of any sign or placard stating or referring directly or indirectly to the price or prices of gasoline or diesel motor fuel, other than those signs or placards required to be posted on the pumps, at, near or about the premises in which gasoline or diesel motor fuel is sold, is unconstitutional since it seeks to regulate commercial speech, which is protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, without effectuating a significant government interest.  Since commercial speech is constitutionally protected, a State can only regulate the time, place and manner of commercial speech, not its content, provided that the regulations serve a significant governmental interest and leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.  Accordingly, defendant oil company cannot be convicted under the statute for placing a sign stating &quot;Check Our Low Low Prices&quot; on the premises since the statute is violative of defendant's First Amendment right of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  free speech.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, since, in the case of gasoline prices, the allegation of &quot;low low low prices&quot; contained in signs placed on the premises of a gasoline service station by defendant oil company can easily be verified at the pump where the price is posted, the banning of such signs would be an infringement upon defendant's First Amendment rights to commercial speech.</SPAN></P>

The posting of the smaller signs on the pumps as required by the local law is not as effective a media for communicating the message of &quot;low prices&quot; as a large sign in front of the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Regulation of Commercial Speech</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's convictions for possession of gambling records and driving while impaired are reversed since&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it was improper for the trial court to wholly exclude the evidence relating to defendant's civilian complaint against a fellow police officer of the arresting officers.  Such evidence should have been allowed in attempted impeachment of the policemen's testimony.  While the extent to which an examination may go for the purpose of proving the hostility of a witness is within the discretion of the court, the court has no discretionary power to rule out all the evidence which is offered for this purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Refusal to Submit to Chemical Blood Test</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The introduction into evidence of a defendant's refusal to submit to a chemical test to determine the alcoholic content of his blood as authorized by statute (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 1194, subd 4), violates such defendant's Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination. While the results of a blood test are not inadmissible on privilege grounds since the privilege is a bar only against compelled &quot;communications&quot; or &quot;testimony&quot; and does not protect against compulsion which makes a suspect or accused the source of &quot;real or physical evidence&quot;, any statements incident to the compelled chemical test would constitute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a testimonial product which falls within the privilege.  Admission of the defendant's testimonial statement of refusal carries a strong circumstantial inference of guilt at trial and constitutes a violation of a defendant's constitutional privilege from being compelled to provide the State with incriminating evidence of a testimonial nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Denial of Preliminary Hearing to Person Charged with Misdemeanor Gambling Offense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While there may be some doubt that the statute excluding persons accused of gambling misdemeanors from the opportunity to request a preliminary hearing ( CPL 170.75) bears some rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose, the failure to afford a preliminary hearing to a defendant charged with such gambling offense does not in any event mandate reversal of his conviction since a conviction after trial will not be vacated on the ground that the defendant was detained pending trial without a determination of probable cause. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Section 240.37 of the Penal Law, which prohibits a person from loitering for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution offense, is not unconstitutionally vague, overbroad and does not unlawfully inhibit freedom of speech.  The language used in the statute is sufficiently plain as to enable persons of ordinary intelligence to understand precisely what acts are proscribed.  Section 240.37 does not improperly make guilt or innocence of the offense depend on the subjective conclusions of the arresting officer. The statute prohibits the specified objective acts of repeatedly beckoning, stopping and interfering &quot;with the free passage of other persons, for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the purpose of prostitution&quot;, which are all capable of determination by the trier of facts.  The absence of specific guidelines describing the means by which an officer determines whether probable cause exists to make an arrest does not render section 240.37 overbroad. A criminal statute need not specify the precise observations necessary to justify an arrest in order to pass constitutional muster.  The fact that prosecution under section 240.37 will involve only circumstantial evidence does not make a conviction under the statute impossible.  Since section 240.37 prohibits only such communication which is &quot;for the purpose&quot; of criminal activity, it does not infringe upon First Amendment rights.  </SPAN></P>

The Civil Court of the City of New York did not have the authority to declare the rent control and rent stabilization laws (Administrative Code of City of New York, tits Y-51, YY-51) unconstitutional as administered at the conclusion of a hearing to ascertain the steps to be undertaken to achieve compliance with required housing standards.  The hearing was ordered after defendants landlords were enjoined from conducting a boiler shut down in protest against the failure of plaintiff Housing and Development Administration to meet the rising costs of operating housing in the City of New York. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the hearing, the trial court improperly permitted defendants to amend their pleadings to conform to the proof and thereby raise the constitutional questions it dealt with.  Such action had the effect of transforming the contentions of defendants into an application for declaratory judgment or article 78 relief.  Jurisdiction to grant such relief is limited solely to the Supreme Court ( CPLR arts 30, 78).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Notwithstanding the finding of no jurisdiction in the Civil Court, the findings and conclusions of that court establishing a total breakdown in the administration of rent control and rent stabilization as the result of unreasonable delays, merit further consideration.  The Legislature should take whatever steps are necessary to remedy the improper administration of the rent control laws.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- power to vacate default judgments obtained by fraud -- court's power to supervise its own processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 217-a of the Judiciary Law, which authorizes an Administrative Judge to bring a proceeding to set aside default judgments obtained by fraud, misrepresentation or other illegality, is constitutional, being a rational expression of the traditional inherent power of a court rendering a judgment to relieve a party from that judgment for sufficient reasons and in the furtherance of justice.  Petitioner commenced the proceeding against appellants to vacate several hundred default judgments obtained by appellants against consumers on installment sales contracts in actions commenced in the Civil Court of the City of New York on the grounds that appellants were without legal capacity to sue as corporations, that they unlawfully conducted business as sales finance companies without a license, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and that the installment contracts underlying the default judgments were permeated with fraud.  Fraudulent practice in consumer credit transactions is a concern of vast public importance. The fact that the defenses alleged in the petition were not raised by defaulting consumers does not estop the court from itself raising such issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the statute is merely declaratory of the court's common-law inalienable power to supervise its own processes, there is no impediment to its application to judgments entered prior to its effective date. Moreover, since the statute is remedial and procedural in nature, it may constitutionally be utilized to test the validity of judgments entered before its enactment.  In any event, courts themselves are not bound by limitations of time imposed on the litigants before them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The fact that a proceeding under section 217-a of the Judiciary Law is commenced by the Administrative Judge does not disqualify the Judges of the Civil Court from hearing such proceeding.  Petitioner, who commenced the proceeding in his administrative capacity, is removed from any judicial function relative to the proceeding.  There has been no showing that the Judges&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Civil Court cannot fairly and impartially adjudicate the merits of the proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officers prior to working for the police department had served in the military. Each had applied for pension credit from the retirement system for their years of active military service. Respondent Comptroller of the State of New York denied their requests on the basis that they had not been employed by the police department prior to their entering the military. The court affirmed the Comptroller's decision. N.Y. Mil. Law &sect; 243(4) and N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 341 established that credits could only be obtained by persons who were public employees before entering the military and had reentered public service. The court agreed, however, that N.Y. Mil. Law &sect; 243(4) and N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 341 discriminated against the police officers. But it held that the police officers failed to establish that there was not a rational basis for the discrimination. Moreover, the court noted that the statutes complied with a decision of the United States Supreme Court that held under the Veteran's Re-employment Rights Act, 38 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2021) an employee that left a job for military service was entitled to pension protection during the absence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The State Comptroller and the Policemen's and Firemen's Retirement System followed existing law in denying additional retirement credits sought by petitioners, each of whom served in the United States Armed Services prior to entering public service as police officers and sought additional credits, since the additional credits are only available to a member of the retirement system who leaves public employment for military service and rejoins the civil service upon discharge from military service, and who has made any required contribution into his retirement account </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Military Law &sect; 243 [4]; Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 341 [a], [b] [6]).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A CPLR article 78 proceeding is not the proper vehicle to challenge the constitutionality of a statute; however, the court can remedy such procedural infirmity under CPLR 103 (c) and reach the merits by converting the article 78 proceeding into an action for a declaratory judgment. Accordingly, a proceeding challenging the constitutionality of Military Law &sect; 243 (4) and Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 341 (a), (b) (6), which permit additional retirement credits to members of the Policemen's and Firemen's Retirement System who leave State service, join the military, and then rejoin State service after making the required contributions into their retirement accounts, is converted into an action for a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

The United States has expressly held that under the Veteran's Re-employment Rights Act such treatment of employees, public or private, who leave a job for military service then subsequently return to their employment, is required.  </SPAN></P>

In an action against the State commenced by an insurance company seeking legal fees and expenses incurred in defending its insured, a physician employed as a professor of medicine in the State University system, in which the insurer contends that defendant was obligated under Public Officers Law &sect; 17 to defend the physician in a medical malpractice action and that it wrongfully refused to do so, the State's motion for summary judgment is denied where claimant alleged that the plaintiff in the malpractice action was a patient receiving care pursuant to the physician's practice plan, whereby physicians/professors may augment their teaching income, and that the operation in which the malpractice allegedly occurred was conducted in furtherance of the physician's professorial duties, since if those allegations are true, the State would be obligated to defend and indemnify the physician.  The right to earn private patient fees pursuant to a physician's practice plan may be considered as additional compensation to the faculty member of a State University medical school; the system serves to attract qualified physicians as professors, provides a supply of patients for teaching purposes, and, thus, is in furtherance of public policy and is not an unconstitutional gift of public moneys </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, NY Const, art VII, &sect; 8).  Moreover, the protection afforded by section 17 may be seen as another inducement to attract qualified personnel as faculty members in State medical schools.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In an action against the State commenced by an insurance company seeking legal fees and expenses incurred in defending its insured, a physician employed as a professor of medicine in the State University system, in which the insurer contends that defendant was obligated under Public Officers Law &sect; 17 to defend the physician in a medical malpractice action and that it wrongfully refused to do so, the insurer's motion for summary judgment is denied; although the State would be liable if the patient who sued the physician had been the subject of medical instruction, the record does not conclusively establish that that patient was actually being treated in furtherance of the physician's role as professor or if she were a purely private patient, not a member of the physician's practice plan, a system whereby qualified physicians are attracted to the faculty of medical schools by permitting them to engage in a limited private practice.  Accordingly, the critical inquiry is not whether the alleged malpractice occurred when the physician was treating a practice plan patient or a nonpractice plan patient who was billed directly by the hospital or medical school; rather, the relevant inquiry must be whether the act for which the State employee was sued was one which was performed within the scope of her State employment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The heating company relied on N.Y. C.P.L.R 214-c, passed after the problem with the homeowners' heating system was identified and corrected. Prior to enactment of the statute a cause of action for personal injuries accrued upon the last exposure to a deleterious substance and had to be commenced within three years thereafter. The heating company argued that the statute eliminated the date of last exposure as the accrual date, applied retroactively to the homeowners' claim, and provided a statute of limitations defense. The court held that absent passage of the statute the homeowners' action would have been timely and that passage of the statute did not bar their claims. The court determined that because N.Y. C.P.L.R. 214-c did not provide a time within which parties with existing claims could initiate an action for exposure, the New York legislature did not intend to time-bar any claim which existed at the time it was enacted.

Penal Law &sect; 245.01, which prohibited public exposure of a female person's breasts below the top of the areola. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the charges asserting that the statute was unconstitutional in that it discriminated against women.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who were women, were arrested for violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 245.01 for baring their breasts at a public park and refusing to cover themselves when ordered to by the police. Defendants did not contest that they were nude from the waist up, they challenged the constitutionality of the statute arguing that it unlawfully discriminated against women. The court agreed with defendants that &sect; 245.01 discriminated on a purely sexual basis in that it commanded women to cover their breasts in public and issued no similar command to men. The court held that such sexual discriminations did not constitute a denial of equal protection of the law because the discrimination was substantially related to the achievement of the important governmental objective of public decency. The court held that &sect; 245.01 rested upon a rational basis, and reflected the current moral standards of New York, and created a constitutionally valid classification between male and female nudity. The court found defendants guilty of violating &sect; 245.01.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Exposure of Person -- Exposure of Female Breasts -- Constitutionality of Gender Classification</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penal Law &sect; 245.01, which makes the public exposure of the breast a penal violation only for women and not for men, is not an unconstitutional deprivation of equal protection of the law, since the gender classification it establishes is substantially related to the important governmental objective of protecting public decency and prohibiting public indecency; in passing a law coping with public nudity and fixing a point of limitation on it, the Legislature maintains public morality and decency, and contributes to the preservation of peace and order by reducing the incidence of circumstances likely to create public disorder.  Moreover, no fundamental right to public nudity exists and public nudity is not an essential ingredient of constitutional liberty.  Given the reality that the female breast possesses the erotic properties of a primary sexual organ and the male breast does not, the sexual classification contained in the statute has a rational basis and reflects the current moral standards of New York, as expressed by the Legislature.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state environmental agency sought an injunction against plaintiff property owners to enjoin them from blocking access to their land. In accordance with N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 0305, the agency intended to conduct studies of the properties as potential sites for a low-level radioactive waste dump. The property owners alleged that the agency's proposed actions amounted to an unconstitutional taking without just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2021, the federal government required each state to provide for the storage, disposal or management of low-level radioactive waste generated within the state. The agency asserted that a preliminary injunction was necessary for reasonable testing of the land to assess the suitability of the land as a low-level radioactive waste disposal site. The agency contended that it would suffer irreparable harm if the property owners continued to deny access pending the outcome of the underlying litigation. The court agreed and granted the injunction. The federal legislature had made establishment of low-level radioactive waste dump sites a high priority, setting time limits and penalties for failure to comply. The balancing of the equities was clearly in the agency's favor. While the property owners were seeking to preserve the their land and the environment, the agency was acting pursuant to a federal mandate intended to protect the public health and welfare of all citizens. Moreover, mere testing of the land was not an unconstitutional taking and N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 0305 provided for the agency's liability in the case of actual damage to the land.</SPAN></P>

It is a well-established exception to the warrant requirement that closely regulated businesses are subject to administrative searches to further the particular regulatory scheme of a given industry.  The vast increase in automobile thefts and related automobile crimes warrants the regulation of the automobile dismantling industry.

The names of the biological parents may not be disclosed to the adoptee or anyone ales absent consent, and any violation by an employee of the Department is subject to criminal and civil penalties; moreover, the Commissioner of Health has promulgated rules and procedures designed to preserve the confidentiality of the records.  Any assurance which respondent may have conveyed to the biological parents in adoption proceedings over which he presided would not have been absolute even prior to enactment of Public Health Law &sect; 4138-b in view of the provision contained in Domestic Relations Law &sect; 114 permitting access to adoption records upon a showing of good cause.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree pursuant to a plea bargain agreement. Defendant filed objections to the court's restitution order. The court ruled on defendant's motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court imposed restitution upon defendant to the Long Island Drug Enforcement Agency Task Force (DEA). Defendant objected to imposition of restitution on the grounds that it constituted a unilateral modification of the plea bargain agreement, that the payment did not constitute &quot;restitution&quot; as that term was meant or intended by N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 60.27 and was therefore unlawful, and that the restitution order was unconstitutional under the New York and United States Constitutions. The court denied defendant's motion. The court's authority to consider restitution at the time of sentencing was an additional remedy beyond those encompassed within a plea bargain entered into between the parties. The DEA was a proper victim under &sect; 60.27. In the course of its investigation, the DEA paid $ 8,200 to purchase controlled substances from defendant. This money was never recovered. The funds were the fruits of defendant's crime and reparation was required because restitution, by definition, was the return of the fruits of a crime. Defendant's agency defense did not involve a fundamental right, but rather involved a factual assertion, and as such, defendant had waived his right to assert it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Sentence -- Restitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A defendant who pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree pursuant to a negotiated plea bargain which included a sentence of imprisonment and a $ 5,000 fine is also ordered to make restitution to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) in the amount of $ 8,200.  Section 60.27(1) of the Penal Law directs the court to consider restitution in addition to any of the dispositions authorized by Penal Law article 60; restitution is to be considered at the time of sentencing whether or not it was considered part of a plea bargain. In imposing restitution, the court was acting upon recommendations made by the Probation Department in its presentence report; defendant's contentions that no victim impact statement was filed and that the District Attorney did not seek the restitution order are baseless. While Penal Law &sect; 60.27 does not specifically define &quot;victim&quot;, the DEA is a proper victim within the meaning of the statute; in the course of its investigation, the DEA paid $ 8,200 to purchase a controlled substance from defendant, and this money was never recovered from defendant.  Clearly, these funds are the &quot;fruits&quot; of defendant's crime and reparation must be made since restitution, by definition, is the return of the fruits of a crime.  Defendant's contention that he was a mere agent for the buyer in the transaction at issue is without merit; in accepting the plea agreement, defendant admitted his guilt of the offense charged and waived any right he had to claim the agency defense at a later time.  </SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the traffic information against defendant, after concluding that &sect; 402(4) was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. Section 402(4) did not give a person of ordinary intelligence notice that driving a pickup truck registered as a passenger vehicle without a cap or seats in the rear violated the statute. Further, the entire Vehicle and Traffic Law was silent as to whether a motorist should register his vehicle as a passenger or commercial vehicle. Moreover, the court was without authority to review the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles' decision to allow defendant to register his vehicle with passenger plates rather than commercial plates.</SPAN></P>

The issuing officer testified that the vehicle did not have a cap on it and that it did not have seats in the rear or seat belts provided for any passenger in the rear. While Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 402(4) prohibits the operation of a motor vehicle which displays number plates not proper for such vehicle, nowhere in the Vehicle and Traffic Law or in the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles does it state how to determine whether to register a motor vehicle as either a commercial or passenger vehicle nor is there a definition of a passenger or commercial vehicle. The statute gives no notice that driving a pickup truck without a cap or seats in the rear, when the vehicle is registered with passenger plates, is in violation of the statute, and is, accordingly, unconstitutionally void for vagueness. Moreover, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles has allowed defendant to register his vehicle with passenger plates and the court does not have the authority to overturn that decision by holding that defendant's vehicle was incorrectly registered. </SPAN></P>

The attorney requested an allowance, in excess of the maximum permitted pursuant to &sect;772-b for his legal fee. The trial court directed payment of a lesser sum for legal fees plus disbursements. The county did not pay the claim but, pursuant to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 22, &sect; 822.4, requested a reduction. The attorney objected and the justice advised counsel that he would act on the request unless counsel promptly requested that consideration be deferred pending the institution and determination of a lawsuit to be commenced by the attorney. Upon review, the court denied the attorney's request that the county pay his legal fees. The court found that the appellate courts had the authority to award compensation in excess of the statutory maximum in appropriate cases before such courts. The court stated that it was not persuaded by the attorney's claims that low allowances resulted in inadequate representation of indigents and rejected the argument that the fee-setting order a judicial order. Because the administrative process was not completed, the court found that it was premature to rule upon the issues raised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the parents of a brain dead infant, filed an action against respondents, the New York City Health &amp; Hospitals Corporation, and the city and state of New York (hospital ). The parents challenged the validity of a determination of death regulation, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 10, &sect; 400.16, and its application to their child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Parents sought to prevent the withdrawal of life support from their infant child, who was determined to be brain dead, in accordance with the New York State Department of Health (DOH) regulation, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 10, &sect; 400.16. The parents challenged the validity of the regulation and its application to their child. The issues were whether the infant was &quot;dead&quot; within the meaning of the regulation, and whether the regulation was consistent with current medical knowledge and law. The court answered each question in the affirmative, and held that it had no authority to interfere. The parents offered no evidence to contradict the medical testing. The regulation's definition of &quot;death&quot; which included the irreversible and complete cessation of the functioning of the entire brain, including the brain stem, was consistence under modern medicine and law. Finally, the DOH had the authority to promulgate the regulation, N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2800, and the regulation was within the DOH's discretionary power. The regulatory standards were specific, and the parents were not deprived of their due process rights to participate in the medical care of their child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the validity of the determination of death regulation, and its application to the parents' child. The court had no authority to intervene in the decision to withdraw life support. The definition of death in the regulation was satisfied, the regulation was based on sound medical criteria, and it was constitutionally and validly promulgated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Death -- Determination of Death</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent hospital acted properly in determining that petitioners' newborn infant is clinically brain dead and should be removed from all mechanical devices maintaining heart and lung function after following all the procedures established by the Department of Health (DOH) for determining when death has occurred (10 NYCRR 400.16).  DOH, as the agency charged with &quot;responsibility for development and administration of the state's policy with respect to hospital and related services&quot; (Public Health Law &sect; 2800), had authority to establish uniform standards for determining death for hospitals and other licensed facilities and it acted responsibly in codifying existing law for hospitals and providing guidance in how to proceed in this area.  DOH's regulation is not unconstitutional as being &quot;vague and overly broad&quot; since it is based on sound medical criteria, nor has the regulation resulted in a deprivation of due process since petitioners were notified before a determination was made and were given an opportunity to obtain an independent medical evaluation and were also offered a chance to have the matter discussed with religious leaders and friends. *2 </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After deliberations began, the jury indicated that it was deadlocked, and one juror was unable to continue because of illness. Because the alternate jurors had not been acceptable to either side, the trial court released the alternates over defense objection and granted defendant's motion for mistrial. In its motion to bar retrial, defendant argued that a retrial would have violated double jeopardy principles. The court denied the defendant's motion, holding that (1) even assuming that the discharge of the first alternate was &quot;illegal,&quot; the trial court could not have contemplated a mistrial because deliberations continued, and thus the trial court's alleged illegal actions were not intended to &quot;goad&quot; defendant into a mistrial; (2) defendant's motion for mistrial barred any claim of double jeopardy; (3) nothing in the Double Jeopardy Clause mandated the existence of alternate jurors or, if such were available, the substitution of an incapacitated juror; and (4) manifest necessity existed even if the alternate jurors were present at the time the mistrial was declared because it would not have been proper for the trial court to have seated an alternate after deliberations had begun.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's retrial is not barred on double jeopardy grounds where the court, over defendant's objection, released the two alternate jurors during jury deliberations and then declared a mistrial upon defendant's motion after two days of deadlocked deliberations when one of the jurors became ill and was unable to continue deliberating since, even if the mistrial was not based upon manifest necessity, there is no evidence that the court had an improper motive for discharging the alternate jurors or was trying to &quot;goad&quot; defendant into moving for a mistrial. Defendant's motion for mistrial thus bars any claim of double jeopardy. Even assuming the court's request for a &quot;motion&quot; constituted improper coercion causing defense counsel's mistrial motion, defendant's retrial is still not barred on double jeopardy grounds since there is no statutory or constitutional requirement that the court select any alternate jurors </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, CPL 270.30) or that an alternate juror be substituted for an incapacitated juror. Furthermore, substitution of an alternate juror for a deliberating juror presents substantial fair trial and due process problems and should be used sparingly. In any event, under the totality of the circumstances, manifest necessity existed even if the alternate jurors were present at the time the mistrial was declared.   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A woman said she had a PINS warrant for her daughter who was not home in awhile. The officer saw a young woman across the street, called out her name, and the girl walked in her direction. When the girl got to the police car, the officer said there was a PINS warrant and she would have to take her to the precinct. While the girl was getting into the car, the officer searched the girl's person and found numerous vials of alleged crack. Upon review, the court found that the arrest of the girl was without probable cause and unlawful. The court stated that the police officers lacked probable cause to arrest the girl because they had no suspicion of criminal activity and there was an inadequate foundation to base the arrest on the statement of a stranger that a warrant existed. Since the girl's arrest could not be supported by the mere assertion of a warrant, was not based on probable cause and was unauthorized by the runaway statute, the court suppressed the vials of alleged crack seized from her following the improper arrest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner village sought review of a determination of respondent county civil service department, which refused to certify that portion of the village's payroll that included respondent police officers. The officers filed a cross-petition for an order that they be paid pending the outcome of the proceeding, for permission to conduct discovery, and for a jury trial. The department filed a motion to dismiss the officers' cross-petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officers were hired in 1982 and 1984. The village did not submit its payroll to the department until June 1989. The department refused to certify the officers' payroll because they were not hired from an eligibility list. The village and the officers challenged the refusal. The court denied the department's motion to dismiss the officers' petition, ruled that the department had to certify the payroll, and granted the officers' request for payment. The court ruled that N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 100(5) barred the department from refusing to certify the payroll because the officers finished their probationary periods and held their positions for over three years; thus, they were presumed to have been duly appointed. The court found that &sect; 100(5) was constitutional and did not require the initial appointment to be made from an eligibility list or approved by the department, noting that the department knew of the officers' employment by 1986, but did not act until 1989. The court concluded that &sect; 100(5) did not prevent enforcement of the civil service laws, but did not allow the department to refuse to certify the payroll more that three years after the officers were appointed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the department's motion to dismiss the officers' cross-petition, granted the village's petition to the extent that the department could not refuse to certify its payroll, granted the officers' cross-petition to the extent that they requested payment, and otherwise denied the officers' cross-petition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although petitioner village did not, as required by law, appoint respondent police officers to their positions in November 1982 and July 1984, respectively, from any &quot;eligibility list&quot; prepared and certified by respondent Suffolk County Department of Civil Service (Civil Service Law &sect; 61), respondent department may not, however, now refuse to certify the village payroll as to the two corespondent police officers since it may not refuse to certify a payroll more than three years after an employee's appointment in the absence of fraud (Civil Service Law &sect; 100 [5]).  There is no need to read the requirement of initial appointment from an eligibility list into the three-year limitation upon the certification of payrolls nor can fraud be presumed from petitioner's failure to submit its payroll for certification until July 1989 where respondent department was aware of the failure to file the payroll as well as the unlawful appointments as early as 1986.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that a governmentally fixed ceiling price did not constitute just compensation per se. The court held that it was not limited in fixing just compensation for the condemnee's natural gas to the price fixed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The court determined that the issue of just compensation was constitutionally mandated as one for judicial determination in condemnation proceeding. The court rejected the condemnor's contention that the price fixed by the Federal Energy Regulation Commission was the price that the court must fix for the condemnee's commercially recoverable native gas in place. The court held that the contract price of natural gas was the fair market value of the commercially recoverable native gas in place.</SPAN></P>

At defendant's arraignment, the court issued a temporary order of protection (TOP), without a hearing, and ordered defendant to stay away from his wife and home. Subsequently, the prosecution added an additional charge for criminal contempt for alleged violation of the TOP, pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 215.50(3). Defendant filed a motion for hearing pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 510.20, to vacate the TOP and additional contempt charge for insufficient evidence and violation of due process of law. Upon a hearing, the court denied defendant's motion to vacate the original TOP on constitutional grounds because there was timely notice of the right to a hearing. However, the court withdrew its oral decision that there was a sufficient basis for issuance of a TOP because no evidence was taken to determine probable cause. The court granted a new TOP with specific terms of exclusion. The court dismissed the charge of criminal contempt because the terms of the TOP were vague and indefinite.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, charged with criminal contempt (Penal Law &sect; 215.50 [3]) for threatening his wife with violence over the telephone in violation of a temporary order of protection (TOP) issued June 24, 1988 upon his release on his own recognizance at his arraignment on assault and harassment charges brought on the complaint of his wife, has standing to raise constitutional objections to the statute authorizing the issuance of the TOP (CPL 530.12 [1]) even though the initial TOP he is accused of violating is no longer in effect since defendant's liberty and property interests were and are restricted by each of the temporary orders of protection issued against him and the temporary nature of short-term orders may not be used to insulate them from legal challenge.  The existing procedures and criteria for the issuance of temporary orders of protection satisfy the requirements of due process in that a probable cause determination must be made by a judicial officer before a TOP may be issued at arraignment; a defendant is entitled to a presentation of reasons for the issuance of a TOP by the People and the right to be heard in opposition to its issuance; the court must first be satisfied that there is a &quot;danger of injury or intimidation&quot; to the complainant before issuing a TOP as a condition of bail or recognizance; and a defendant has the right to a prompt evidentiary hearing following the issuance of the TOP.  The fact that the court, when issuing a TOP, is not statutorily mandated to state its findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record does not impair the constitutionality of the statute as long as the reasons for the determination are apparent from the record nor does the absence of specific statutory criteria make the statute violative of due process in view of the judicially created standard that a &quot;danger of intimidation or injury&quot; to the complainant exist (the statute having been amended effective November 1, 1988 to list factors to be considered by the court in determining whether to issue a TOP excluding a defendant from the home).  However, the criminal contempt charges against defendant must be dismissed since the provision in the TOP requiring him to &quot;abstain from offensive conduct&quot; against his wife is too vague and indefinite to support a charge of criminal contempt for its violation.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court granted the motion to dismiss the one claim because it did not reference any specific statute, ordinance, or regulation. Otherwise, the court denied the motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action. The court found that the lack of specificity in the other stated claims was not fatal because, as pleaded, they sufficiently complied with the requirements of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3013 by giving notice of the transactions or occurrences and the material elements. The court found that the three-year limitation period of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 214-c for toxic torts applied to time bar the strict liability and negligence claims because the action was commenced more than three years from the date that the husband discovered his injuries. The claims based on breach of contract for the sale of goods were not time-barred because the period of limitations for such claims was four years from the date of the last tender of the delivery of the goods.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority was created by statute and the city and authority entered into several agreements for the authority to operate parking garages. The city sent a notice to the authority, pursuant to the provisions of one of their contracts, and terminated the agreement with respect to one of the parking garages. The authority filed a declaratory judgment action against the city and asserted that the city lacked the power to terminate the agreement or operate the garage itself in direct competition with the authority. The court invalidated the termination and held that regardless of the language of the contract the ownership of the garages reverted to the city only pursuant to the provisions of N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect;&sect; 1596-f(5), -q. The termination provision in the contract was in derogation of the statute and inoperative. Additionally, the covenant against competition in the original contract was valid and the subsequent enactment of N.Y. Laws of 1971 (ch. 491) did not invalidate the contractual provision.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Authorities -- City of Yonkers Parking Authority -- Life Interest in Property Used as Parking Facility</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provision in the 1978 agreement for the operation of a parking garage between respondent City of Yonkers (City) and petitioner Yonkers Parking Authority (Authority), which allowed either party to terminate the agreement &quot;upon 90 days' notice in writing&quot;, is void for being in derogation of the law granting the Authority a life interest in property transferred to it by the City for parking-related functions &quot;for so long as its corporate existence shall continue&quot; ( Public Authorities Law &sect; 1596-f [1]).  In addition, the 90-day cancellation provision is also in conflict with the permit of use afforded the Authority in a 1964 agreement which encompassed the property on which the parking garage was built. Furthermore, the City is barred from operating the parking garage pursuant to the anticompetition clause in the 1964 agreement.  A subsequently enacted law authorizing the City &quot;[n]otwithstanding any provisions of any general, special or local law to the contrary&quot; to &quot;construct, operate and maintain parking facilities&quot; within the City (L 1971, ch 491) did not abrogate the anticompetition clause since nothing in the law precluded the City from contractually giving up its right to compete and, had the law contained language overriding the parties' 1964 agreement, it would have constituted an unconstitutional impairment of an existing contractual obligation. Lastly, the Authority is entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to the provision in the 1978 agreement requiring the City to &quot;[p]rovide legal services as are necessary to the operation of the Garage&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of New York, New York County, considered an action in which plaintiffs, various members of the medical and pharmaceutical professions (professionals), challenged a regulation promulgated by defendant, the State Health Commissioner (Commissioner), which imposed stringent limitations on the prescription of certain common tranquilizers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner promulgated a regulation which significantly changed the prescription methods for a group of commonly used sedatives collectively known as benzodiazepines. Specifically, the regulation required these drugs be prescribed in official triplicate prescriptions, prohibited refills, and limited patients to a 30-day supply. The regulation was passed in response to the Commissioner's findings that large numbers of these drugs were misused, diverted to nonmedical uses, and overprescribed by careless physicians. The professionals feared the regulation would have excessively intruded on their ability to freely treat their patients and claimed that the regulation was unconstitutional. The court found otherwise, and granted the Commissioner summary judgment, because the Commissioner had authority to pass the regulation under N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 3338(3), and the regulation, which was rationally based on a community health concern, did not prevent doctors from prescribing benzodiazepines but rather, prohibited such prescriptions only without the triplicate forms.</SPAN></P>

The record-keeping function of the triplicate system is a reasonable exercise of the State's broad police powers, and there is no basis for the belief that the State would improperly use the information.  The challenged regulation will not disturb the privileged relationship between the doctor and patient nor will it reveal more information than the State must be legally entitled to know.  The Commissioner clearly has the authority to require that such controlled substances be prescribed in triplicate (Public Health Law &sect; 3308) and he fully complied with all procedural requirements in promulgating the regulation (State Administrative Procedure Act &sect;&sect; 202-a, 202-b) after seeking the advice and recommendations of both the Drug Abuse Advisory Council and the Public Health Council and opening the discussion of the regulation to include the input of any interested agencies.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly made minor boys touch his penis and fondle their penises. In his motion to dismiss the count of endangering the welfare of a child, defendant urged that &sect; 260.10(1) was void for vagueness because it did not define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness such that ordinary people could understand what conduct was prohibited. Defendant did not point specifically to any language in the statute as vague, either as applied to his own alleged offense or in general. The court denied the motion, stating that, while perhaps unusual in the context of the Penal Law, the language of &sect; 260.10(1) used ordinary terms to express ideas, which found adequate interpretation in common usage and understanding, and was sufficient to warn of what was required and what was prohibited. Indeed, the language of &sect; 260.10(1) was certainly sufficient to inform a &quot;reasonable man&quot; that making minor boys fondle his and their penises was among activities prohibited as likely to be injurious to the physical, mental, or moral welfare of a male child.</SPAN></P>

Code, tit. 27, ch. 1, &sect; 27-361. Defendant allegedly obstructed exits in the tennis center during tennis matches attended by thousands of spectators.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, which owned and managed the facility in which the tennis tournament was held, was charged with violating &sect; 27-361 by obstructing exits during the tennis tournament. The obstruction was caused by a chain strung across stairwells and passageways, as well as the resulting groups of people who congregated in those areas until the chain was periodically removed. The court rejected defendant's assertion that the building code did not apply to people awaiting seating at tennis matches. Section 27-361 clearly and unequivocally required that exits and access pathways had to be kept clear for use at all times without obstruction. The court also concluded that the building code provided the necessary notice of the exact conduct prohibited and equated exits and access facilities with stairwells and passageways. Section 27-361 was neither unconstitutionally vague nor violative of the state and federal Due Process Clauses. The accumulation of a large group of people in the arena stairwells constituted a failure to keep exists readily accessible and unobstructed within the meaning of the provision. Defendant was found guilty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, the operator of a public tennis facility in Flushing Meadow Park where the United States Open is held, violated the provision of the New York City Building Code mandating that all &quot;exits and access facilities * * * be kept readily accessible and unobstructed at all times&quot; ( Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 27-361) by allowing the passageway exits at the tennis center to become obstructed by spectators not permitted to proceed to their seats during play in order to minimize the possible diversion of the players' concentration during the match. Blocked exits are a primary cause of injuries and often death when disasters occur at public events involving the assemblage of large numbers of people and defendant clearly engaged in a course of conduct that blocked the passageways. Defendant required no prior notification of the violation ( Administrative Code &sect; 26-246 [a] [1]) nor is the prosecution subject to discontinuance because of the prompt alleged correction of the condition upon notification. The statute is not unconstitutionally vague since it imparts fair notice that obstruction of exits and passageways by spectators is prohibited </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Administrative Code &sect; 27-531).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged defendant in the Criminal Court of the City of New York, New York County (New York) with endangering the welfare of a child in violation of N.Y. Penal. Law. &sect; 260.10(1), and, with sexual abuse in the third degree in violation of N.Y. Penal. Law. &sect; 130.55. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information on constitutional grounds and that his statutory rights to a speedy trial had been denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that N.Y. Penal. Law. &sect; 260.10(1), and, N.Y. Penal. Law. &sect; 130.55 were unconstitutional as written because the language used to delineate the prohibited conduct was vague under the due process clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions. Alternately, defendant argued that the statutes were unconstitutional as applied. He also argued that the document filed by the people, that converted the complaint to an information, was insufficient to constitute a corroborating affidavit as required by N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 100.30 and, accordingly the charges had to be dismissed because more than 90 days had elapsed since commencement of the action. The court rejected defendant's arguments and denied the motion. The court noted that legislative enactments were presumed constitutional unless unconstitutionality was demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt. The court examined the language of both statutes and found them to be constitutional as a person of reasonable intelligence would have had sufficient notice that the alleged conduct was prohibited. The court also noted that the supporting document used to convert the complaint to an information was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Legislative enactments are presumed constitutional and the burden of demonstrating that a statute is unconstitutional rests with the party seeking to invalidate it; unconstitutionality must be shown beyond a reasonable doubt.  Moreover, a law is void if it fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute, or if the failure to provide explicit standards for application encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Penal Law &sect; 260.10 (1), which defines the crime of endangering the welfare of a child, is neither unconstitutionally vague nor unconstitutional as applied to defendant, a 40-year-old man who was accused of placing his arm up the dress of a 16-year-old girl and fondling her leg and upper thigh, since the void-for-vagueness argument has already been rejected by the Court of Appeals in deciding a case under the predecessor statute to section 260.10 (1), i.e., former Penal Law &sect; 483; the court concluded that the statute provided adequate notice to all persons subject to its mandate of both the nature of the conduct prohibited and what is required of them to refrain from violating its proscription.  The conduct prohibited under the statute requires a showing that the defendant had to have some degree of control over the minor child as a predicate to the imposition of criminal liability, and based on the misdemeanor complaint lodged against defendant, sufficient facts have been alleged to create an issue of fact where defendant and the complainant were riding on a bus transporting air travelers from an airport to Manhattan.  Moreover, defendant's motion to dismiss is premature: at the very least a trial is warranted to establish a full record with respect to defendant's control over the complainant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sexual Abuse -- &quot;Intimate Part&quot; -- Leg and Thigh</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a prosecution for sexual abuse in the third degree (Penal Law &sect; 130.55), the leg and thigh may be considered an &quot;intimate part&quot; of the complainant's body within the definition of &quot;sexual contact&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Penal Law &sect; 130.00 [3]), since a determination of what is &quot;intimate&quot; involves considerations other than mere anatomical location, and what is &quot;intimate&quot; cannot be determined independently of the circumstances of the alleged behavior.  Penal Law &sect; 130.55 is not void for vagueness since a person of reasonable intelligence would have sufficient notice of what conduct is prohibited; &quot;sexual&quot; may connote a sphere of behavior associated with libidinal gratification rather than any specific acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Speedy Trial -- Conversion of Complaint to Information</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a sex crimes prosecution involving a 16-year-old female victim, defendant was not denied his statutory right to a speedy trial by the fact that the document filed by the People to convert the complaint to an information lacked an attestation, used the male gender to describe the complainant, and may not have been subscribed in New York State, since the existence of a form notice together with the subscription of the deponent are sufficient to verify the document, since the inadvertent use of the male gender was merely a formal error not affecting the validity of the document, which can be corrected without the complainant being required to swear to a new affidavit, and since even if the complainant is a New York State resident the court considers CPL 20.20 (2) (b) would confer jurisdiction on the court over a violation of Penal Law &sect; 210.45 committed out of State under the circumstances.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, firemen and their wives, filed a complaint against defendants, operator and other companies, seeking money damages for injuries allegedly sustained as a result of fighting a fire on the operator's premises.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firemen were exposed to polyvinyl chloride at the fire and claimed that after the applicable statutes of limitation had expired, it became clear that their exposure had lasting effects. Therefore, plaintiffs claimed that the revival statute applied to revive their claims for injuries caused by the latent effects of PVC exposure. The court found that the complaint was filed in a timely manner under the revival statute and rejected defendants' contention that the failure to expressly plead the revival statute or to expressly allege latent effects of PVC exposure rendered the complaint fatally defective. The court granted plaintiffs leave to amend. The court granted defendants' motion as to claims against the other companies. The court found that actions based upon N.Y. Gen. Mun.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Limitation of Actions -- Revival of Time-Barred Action -- Toxic Tort</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revival statute, which provides that every action for personal injury caused by the latent effects of exposure to certain toxic substances, including polyvinyl chloride (PVC), that would otherwise be time barred as of July 30, 1986 may be commenced within one year from that date (L 1986, ch 682, &sect; 4), applies to revive plaintiffs' action commenced in June 1987 to recover for injuries caused by the latent effects of exposure to PVC while fighting a fire at defendant telephone company's building in February 1975, even though plaintiffs failed to expressly plead the revival statute in the complaint or to expressly allege latent effects of exposure to PVC, since plaintiffs are granted leave to amend the complaint ( CPLR 3025 [b]).  In view of the legislative determination that PVC can cause latent severe ill effects to those who ingest it, the revival statute as it relates to PVC must be deemed constitutional to the same extent it has been deemed constitutional with regard to DES </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Hymowitz v Lilly &amp; Co</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 73 NY2d 487). In addition, the fact that certain injuries caused by PVC exposure were discovered shortly after the incident does not preclude a claim that more severe latent effects were not discovered until expiration of the applicable limitations period nor does any prejudice to defendants from the passage of time between the incident and the action render the revival of plaintiffs' action unconstitutional.  However, although plaintiffs' causes of action regarding safety violations that created hazards additional to those firefighters already face ( General Municipal Law &sect; 205-a) are revived by the revival statute, they must be dismissed for failure to specify or identify the statutes, ordinances or rules defendants neglected or failed to comply with.  </SPAN></P>

Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 510(6), now N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1193(2)(c). Section 1193(2)(c) prohibited the issuance of a driver's license to a person who had been twice convicted of driving under the influence where personal injury resulted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was convicted of driving under the influence, where there were personal injuries to himself and a passenger. Later, the applicant was involved in a one-car accident from which his second conviction resulted. His license was revoked, and his administrative appeal was denied. On judicial review, the court rejected the applicant's contentions that &sect; 1193(c)(2) was unconstitutionally vague in its failure to define &quot;personal injury,&quot; holding that the applicant failed to rebut the presumption that the ordinary meaning was adequate to put a person on notice of prohibited conduct. The injuries that the applicant sustained in the first automobile accident were &quot;personal injuries&quot; as contemplated by &sect; 1193(c)(2). The court rejected the commissioner's argument that the applicant had waived his due process arguments by failing to supply documentation to his claims or request a hearing. The applicant's written request for review and his representations concerning the availability of witnesses that would have confirmed his assertion that he was not injured in the second accident were adequate to invoke his procedural rights.

In addition, the term &quot;personal injury&quot; encompasses relatively minor injuries and injuries to self in view of the State's strong interest in removing drunk drivers from the road and the fact that &quot;societal costs are incurred regardless of who is injured&quot;.  However, petitioner, a truck driver whose application for a new driver's license was denied on the ground that a second driving while intoxicated conviction resulted in a minor head cut to himself, was denied procedural due process and is entitled to have the determination annulled since he had no notice whatsoever that permanent revocation of his license based on two alleged injury-related accidents was under consideration nor any opportunity for a fact-finding hearing as to whether any personal injury resulted from the second conviction.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State Liquor Authority's delegation of authority for licensing to the licensing board is a &quot;rule or regulation&quot; which must be filed with the Secretary of State pursuant to NY Constitution, article IV, &sect; 8 in order to be effective, since such delegation establishes a course of conduct for the future.  Although a rule or regulation which relates to an agency's organization or internal management is excepted from the constitutional mandate, the fact that the Authority's delegation includes internal management matters, insofar as it designates the individuals who are to serve on the licensing board, does not make the rest of the delegation exempt from filing.  Accordingly, the Authority's delegation of licensing authority to the licensing board is constitutionally defective, since the Authority has failed to file that delegation with the Secretary of State.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Inasmuch as the State Liquor Authority's delegation of licensing authority to the licensing board is defective for failure to satisfy the filing mandate of NY Constitution, article IV, &sect; 8 and the rule-making procedures of the State Administrative Procedure Act, a determination of the licensing board denying petitioner's application for a warehouse permit is not a valid final act of the State Liquor Authority which may be reviewed by the court in a CPLR article 78 proceeding; moreover, the lack of finality requires the invalidation of the determination.  Accordingly, in a CPLR article 78 proceeding to review the Authority's determination denying petitioner's application, the petition is granted, the determination is annulled and the matter is remitted for a proper final determination. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners filed a motion for summary judgment requesting that the court declare &sect; 277(1) of the Town Law and &sect; 44.15 of the Town of Lewisboro Land Development Regulations unconstitutional in an action involving the taking of certain land for development.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was an action for declaratory judgment wherein the landowners challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 277(1) of the town law and &sect; 44.15 of the town development regulations. The statute and the regulation authorized the planning board of defendant town to require payment of money in lieu of reservation of park land as a condition of approving a subdivision plat, the amount was to be determined by the town board of trustees. The landowners moved for summary judgment such that the court would declare the statute and the regulation unconstitutional. The court held that the statute and the regulation were not unconstitutional and that no equal protection violation had occurred. The imposition of the fee in lieu of the reservation on new developments held a rational relationship to the legitimate purposes of the challenged legislation. Therefore, the town's cross motion for summary judgment was granted to the extent that the court declared the statute and the regulation constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Declaratory Judgments -- When Remedy Appropriate -- Future Event</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The fact that a court may be required to determine the rights of parties upon the happening of a future event does not mean that a declaratory judgment will be merely advisory; in the typical case where the future event is an act contemplated by one party, it is assumed that the parties will act in accordance with the law and, thus, the court's determination will have the immediate and practical effect of influencing their conduct.  Accordingly, in an action to declare unconstitutional a statute (Town Law &sect; 277 [1]) and regulations authorizing a town Planning Board to require payment of money in lieu of reservation of park land as a condition of approving a subdivision plat, with the money to be used for the purchase and development of recreational areas within the town, the matter is imminent and not beyond the control of the parties, thereby being ripe for adjudication, where plaintiffs are owners of undeveloped subdividable parcels in some phase of the administrative process leading to subdivision approval, and where defendant town admits that the Planning Board has never required reservation of any park land as a condition of development approval and that it has been the prevailing practice to require all developers to make payment in lieu of park land reservation pursuant to section 277 (1), since it is a virtual certainty that plaintiffs will be assessed with the $ 5,000 per lot fee charged by the town as a condition of subdivision approval.</SPAN></P>

In an action to declare unconstitutional a statute (Town Law &sect; 277 [1]) and local regulations authorizing a town Planning Board to require payment of money in lieu of reservation of park land as a condition of approving a subdivision plat, with the money to be used for the purchase and development of recreational areas within the town, plaintiff developer lacks standing in light of a prior judicial decision holding that the town lacked power to impose a recreation fee on its &quot;cluster&quot; development subdivision plan under Town Law &sect; 281; while that matter is currently on appeal, it is clear that within the framework of the instant action, plaintiff cannot be injured monetarily since the town is precluded from imposing a fee in lieu of reservation of park land upon plaintiff's section 281 cluster development even if it is determined that defendant town has the power to impose such a fee on a conventional, i.e., Town Law &sect; 277, subdivision.  Accordingly, the matter is not ripe as to plaintiff and the complaint insofar as it seeks declaratory relief on behalf of that plaintiff is dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Every law is presumed constitutional and only when unconstitutionality is shown to exist beyond a reasonable doubt is the presumption overcome; the presumption of constitutionality is not limited to State statutes, since it applies to ordinances of municipalities as well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In an action to declare unconstitutional a statute (Town Law &sect; 277 [1]) and local regulations authorizing a town Planning Board to require payment of money in lieu of reservation of park land as a condition of approving a subdivision plat, defendant town has shown that a nexus exists between the payment of the fee, which shall be used for the purchase and development of recreational areas within the town, and the legitimate State interest sought to be advanced, viz., to contribute to the need for expanding the existing recreational facilities within the town, since the legislation is designed to alleviate the particular effects that developments will create.  The benefits derived from this exaction need not solely accrue to plaintiffs' subdivisions as plaintiffs' individual needs cannot be isolated from community-wide needs where the town has determined, for economic reasons, to develop large regional parks instead of small satellite parks. Moreover, inasmuch as a genuinely valid purpose for the legislation has been established, plaintiffs' per se constitutional attack is without merit since they have not alleged that they are denied an economically viable use of their property.</SPAN></P>

Inasmuch as there is no suspect classification or fundamental right at issue, the rational basis test should be applied to plaintiffs' contention that equal protection was violated by having so few property owners bear so large a proportion of the recreational expenditures of the town.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner truck washing company brought an action against respondent requesting relief under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 from a denial of its request for a variance, which would permit it to use the city's water supply for continued business operation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city declared a drought emergency that directly effected the truck washing business. The truck washing business applied for a variance, which was denied. The truck washing business argued that it had been granted a variance during previous drought emergencies and that it had met the test for a variance in this instance. The court held that the truck washing business could not just contend that it would suffer an economic hardship, but it had to prove the hardship, which it failed to do. The court reasoned that there were alternatives available to the truck washing business. The court concluded that the truck washing business was not entitled to a formal hearing with formal findings prior to it being denied a variance. The court determined that because there were alternatives available, the issuance of variance would have provided the truck washing business preferential treatment over its competitors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Drought Emergency Rules -- Ban on Car Washing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The denial of a variance from the New York City Stage II Drought Emergency Rules barring the washing of vehicles with water from the public water system so as to permit petitioner to conduct its truck washing business is not arbitrary and capricious even if petitioner will suffer economic hardship since there are alternative sources of water and alternative means available to petitioner to operate the business.  The issuance of a variance to petitioner would afford it a preferential treatment over its competitors and such a result is contrary to the purposes of the Drought Emergency Rules in that it would circumvent the city's effort to deter the use of water for nonessential purposes.  Petitioner is not entitled to a hearing since a governmental agency acting in an administrative capacity pursuant to a statute granting it powers is not required to hold formal hearings and issue formal findings prior to rendering a determination.  In addition, the fact that the Stage II regulations may make the cost of conducting petitioner's business greater, or even make it impossible to continue in business, is no reason to invalidate the regulations. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Town Court of the Town of Genesee (New York), which convicted him of misdemeanors for &quot;wasting&quot; oil, in violation of N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 71-1305(1) and &quot;polluting&quot; the land, in violation of N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 71-1305(2) and 6 N.Y Comp. Code R. &amp; Regs. &sect; 556.5(a). Defendant claimed that the prohibition against &quot;wasting&quot; oil in N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. &sect; 71-1305 (1) was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant also contended that he was never properly arraigned on the second charge pertaining to pollution, that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and that his procedural due process rights were violated by delay in rendering of the decision, resulting in delay in the ability to appeal. The court found that defendant waived any objection he had in regard to arraignment on the &quot;pollution&quot; count. The court concluded that defendant was not deprived of procedural due process, because there was no constitutional guarantee of a &quot;speedy appeal&quot; corresponding to that of a &quot;speedy trial&quot; On the key question whether the statute was unconstitutionally void for vagueness, the court concluded that the definition of &quot;waste&quot; was not sufficiently set forth in the law. Thus, while the court concluded that there was adequate proof of the offense of &quot;pollution, the burden of proof on the &quot;waste&quot; conviction was not met and the conviction was set aside. Because it was not apparent to what extent a fine imposed pertained to the waste count, the matter was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the pollution conviction and it reversed the waste conviction, so it remanded the case for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental Conservation -- Pollution Control -- &quot;Waste&quot; of Oil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's conviction in Town Court for &quot;polluting&quot; the land ( ECL 71-1305 [2]; 6 NYCRR 556.5 [a]) is affirmed since there was adequate proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the elements of the offense of &quot;pollution&quot;.  Defendant waived any objection to the lack of a proper arraignment on the &quot;pollution&quot; charge, which was commenced by the filing of an amended information at the threshold of the trial, since the trial went forward after counsel reached an understanding concerning the charges presented by the amended information during off-the-record discussions.  Defendant's procedural due process rights were not violated by the trial court's eight-month delay in rendering its decision and the five-month delay in filing its return since extenuating circumstances, including the illness of the Trial Judge, excuse the delays and defendant was not unduly prejudiced inasmuch as he was not incarcerated. However, defendant's conviction for &quot;wasting oil&quot; ( ECL 71-1305 [1]) must be reversed since the prohibitory statute and implementing regulations (6 NYCRR 550.3 [az]) are unconstitutionally vague in that the failure to specify what degree of criminal intent is required, when the crime of waste occurs and the absence of any quantitative measure, result in the failure to give a reasonable person notice of the nature of what conduct is prohibited and what conduct is required.  </SPAN></P>
