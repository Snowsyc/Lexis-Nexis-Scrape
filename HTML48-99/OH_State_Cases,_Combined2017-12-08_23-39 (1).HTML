<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of various gambling offenses. Based on that, the city commenced forfeiture proceedings to seize profits derived from the unlawful activity. The lower court determined the amount of money linked to the gambling operation and ordered the city to return the rest of the money that was seized. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.41(C) applied to defendants' case because it was passed before the date of the hearing. The date of the seizure was irrelevant. According to &sect; 2933.41(C), defendants' profits were subject to forfeiture if it was unlawful for them to possess the funds or the money was the subject or used in connection with a criminal offense. The latter applied here presuming that the statute operated prospectively, which was the case absent express contrary language. There was no error in the return of some of the seized funds to defendants. The determination of the amount subject to forfeiture was reasonable given that the law authorized the taking of funds upon a showing that they were produced by the gambling operation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Insurers filed complaints in several cases against the municipalities and their employees alleging that the municipalities were liable for damages resulting from car accidents negligently caused by their employees.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court relied on precedent and held that &sect; 2744.05(B) was unconstitutional because the classification created by the statute between subrogated claimants and all other claimants was not rationally related to the purpose of preserving the fiscal integrity of municipalities.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an employee and another interested party, appealed the summary judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Wayne County (Ohio), which held that defendant employer had not committed an intentional tort against the employee and was not liable to plaintiffs. Previously the matter was appealed to the court on the question of whether a new statute was to be retroactively applied, and the matter was remanded to the common pleas court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee had heart problems, and he claimed that his employer continued to require him to perform excessive overtime work even though a doctor's statement declared that he could not perform strenuous work. After the doctor's statement was provided to the employer, the employee suffered a heart problem that he attributed to overwork. Following that problem, he was examined by another physician, and that physician confirmed the existence of heart problems. The employer offered the employee a less strenuous position, but he rejected the position, claiming that the offer was made in bad faith. Upon appeal, the lower court's judgment that no intentional tort had been established was affirmed. The court held that the employer's new job offer did not establish that the employer intended to injure the employee. The court further ruled that the employee's evidence that the employer intended to injure him when he was required to perform excessive overtime work was insufficient because it relied on the employee's own assertions that he was overworked and not proof that the employer had disregarded specific, medically documented, work restrictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, trustees and owners of property and a developer and agent of the trust, challenged a judgment of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which consolidated an appeal from defendant city council's denial of a conditional zoning certificate with appellants' separate action against the city for injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment and upheld the city council's decision to deny appellants a conditional zoning certificate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants wanted to build a mini-mall on several acres of property located in a commercial district. Pursuant to Stow, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 153.092, the planning commission reviewed and approved appellants' proposed use of the property and prepared a resolution for city council approving the application. The city council denied appellants' application and, at the same meeting, rezoned the property to residential use. Appellants challenged the council's action as contrary to law and the rezoning ordinance as unconstitutional. Reversing the trial court's judgment upholding the council's action, the court held that the council acted outside the administrative power vested in it by the city's zoning ordinance by denying a proposed use that was consistent with the existing zoning. The court determined that the record did not support the finding that the rezoning procedure properly amended the code and that, even if the zoning resolution were constitutional on its face, its application to appellants' property was unconstitutional because the council could not choose to substitute a legitimate legislative purpose in order to rectify an illegal administrative act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and ordered the trial court on remand to render a judgment ordering the city council to grant appellants the appropriate certificates, with such pertinent and necessary requirements and/or conditions as were consistent with the zoning code. The court also ordered the trial court to render a judgment for appellants, declaring the rezoning ordinance unconstitutional as applied to appellants' property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant employer appealed a decision of a trial court (Ohio), which, in plaintiff former employee's intentional tort action, granted the employee a jury trial and granted his motion requesting that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 be held unconstitutional insofar as it denied him a jury trial and his prayer for damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former employee brought an action against the employer on the theory of intentional tort. The trial court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(D) violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 5 insofar as it purported to eliminate a plaintiff's right to a jury trial in an intentional tort action and to have the Ohio Industrial Commission determine damages. The trial court granted the employee a jury trial. The court dismissed the employer's appeal for lack of a jurisdiction, concluding that there had been no final order. The court reasoned that, under decisional law, an order concerning a single claim was not a final order and an order denying a jury trial to the State an action under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 6111 was not an order affecting a substantial right made in a special proceeding. The court agreed with another county's appellate court's holding that an order granting a jury trial in an Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 case was not a final order, so the court could not decide the merits of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence was presented at trial that a teenage girl's decomposed body was found three months after her disappearance. While semen could not be detected, the body was unclothed below the waist. Defendant's girlfriend later divulged that defendant had abducted the girl. He also had some of her belongings after he admitted to strangling her. Defendant was convicted and his sentence included the death penalty. He appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that it was not an abuse of discretion to prohibit defense counsel from making arguments during jury selection and a potential juror was properly excused where she indicated that sitting in a capital case would be too upsetting. The admission of two gruesome photographs of the victim's decomposed body was not improper because the danger of prejudice was outweighed by their probative value in illustrating the coroner's testimony. The circumstantial evidence of the victim's body being nude from the waist down and defendant's possession of her property was sufficient for reasonable minds to exclude inferences that she was not raped or robbed. Also, neither prosecutorial misconduct nor ineffective assistance of defense counsel were shown.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it denied defendant's motion for acquittal made at the close of the prosecution's case-in-chief. The court found that the prosecution had established sufficient evidence to determine that defendant knowingly had dominion and control of the automobile and the money orders. The trial court did not err when it denied defendant's motion for acquittal since reasonable minds could have reached different conclusions as to whether each material element of receiving stolen property had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant contended numerous errors were made by his counsel. Defendant neither offered any evidence supporting why a motion to suppress any evidence should have been filed nor had he identified what conduct or which statements were prejudicial. After defendant's arrest, the vehicle was searched pursuant to an inventory search. Finally, defendant failed to identify how the sentencing procedure had implicated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

Code Ann. &sect; 2953.36, which made expungement unavailable to offenders who were not eligible for probation, including offenders who committed offenses requiring actual incarceration, created an arbitrary distinction between probationable offenses, for which expungement was available, and non-probationable offenses such as his, for which expungement was not available. Defendant argued that he was denied equal protection of the law because expungement was foreclosed for his third-degree felony, while it was otherwise available to those who served the same term of imprisonment for such offenses as arson, gross sexual imposition, or aggravated assault of a police officer. It was impossible for the court to conclude that that the statute in question created a classification that was manifestly arbitrary or unreasonable, or that the statute exceeded the scope of legislative discretion. The distinction was rationally related to the expungement statute's purpose to provide remedial relief to qualified offenders in order to facilitate the prompt transition of those individuals into meaningful and productive roles.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's application for expungement of his conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The councilwoman had legislation passed in the city council to allow the homeowner to move a house to a certain location. He first moved the house to a state-owned lot. There was a subsequent fire in the house, and it was declared a public nuisance. A notice of violation of the building ordinances was sent to the homeowner which directed him to either raze it or secure permits to repair it. The house was then relocated again. That same evening, another fire occurred. The premises were inspected, and no violations were found. A third fire occurred again soon thereafter. That day an engineer inspected the house and recommended that it should be demolished immediately. The demolition occurred that afternoon. The homeowner filed an action against the city, the councilwoman, and the director for trespass, conversion, fraud, malicious destruction of property, violation of due process, and defamation. The trial court granted summary judgment against the homeowner. The court reversed the judgment, by holding that no evidence was presented to show that the demolition was reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected defendant's claim that she did not receive a fair trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of nine counts of rape and four counts of pandering sexually-oriented material in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.322. Defendant sought review and contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial or to modify the verdict. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.03 permitted the police to arrest and detain a person whom they had reasonable cause to believe was guilty of an offense. The court further determined that the probable cause for arrest was considered on a factual standard based on the conduct of reasonable men and held that it was less stringent than the standard required for conviction. The court held that prior Miranda warnings were not required to validate consent searches, even when such consent was obtained after defendant was effectively in custody. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.59 and Ohio R. Evid. 404(B), evidence of defendant's motive or intent were not admissible to prove character but were admissible to show his opportunity, motive, intent, or preparation.

Two other defendants were observed dancing in similar outfits.

On appeal from defendants' convictions, the court held that the ordinances were constitutionally applied and found that: (1) the states had broad powers under the Twenty-First Amendment to regulate the sale of liquor, which right outweighed any First Amendment interest in nude dancing; (2) as such, the state could ban nude dancing in establishments that serve intoxicating liquors; and (3) defendants lacked standing to assert the right of third parties to challenge the ordinances.</SPAN></P>

The trial court convicted him of trafficking in cocaine and demerol and abusing morphine and dilaudid. On appeal, the court reversed. The court stated that the information provided by the two concerned citizens fell short of supporting a finding of probable cause to have issued a search warrant. The court ruled that the affidavit in support of the warrant did not inform the magistrate of the basis of the informant's knowledge, therefore, evidence obtained as a result of the search warrant was inadmissible. The court further held that the common-law good-faith exception should not have been overruled and an objection to the continuous admission of prior unadjudicated criminal acts was not preserved for review. The court further stated that the trial court did not err in admitting exhibits of past record statements by five prosecution witnesses and the sentencing did not deprive defendant of his right to be protected from double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of various charges and sentenced to death for the aggravated murder conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant's waiver of his constitutional rights to counsel, to remain silent, and to a jury trial was valid. The court found that defendant's mental condition did not, by itself, universally prevent him from effectively waiving his rights, and that the evidence did not demonstrate that any inappropriate coercion was applied to defendant. Additionally, the court held that the imposition of the death penalty was proper and was not excessive or disproportionate to sentences imposed in similar cases. The court found that the evidence presented at the mitigation hearing as to defendant's mental and physical condition, age, family, treatment history, and passive nature did not outweigh the aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Common Pleas Court, County of Summit (Ohio) for gross sexual imposition and rape. Three counts of the indictment averred that during certain periods, defendant purposely compelled his minor stepdaughter, by force or threat of force, to engage in sexual conduct in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(A)(1)(b) and &sect; 2907.02(A)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant married the victim's mother when the victim was three years old. He began sexually abusing the victim when she was 10 years old, until she was 17 years old, including intercourse and oral sex. The abuse occurred in one county for many years, then continued when the family moved to another county. Defendant was indicted in one county for all of the abuse charges, including charges for rape. On appeal, he argued that the indictment should have been dismissed because the trial court did not have venue over many of the offenses, he had not committed &quot;rape&quot; as defined in &sect; 2907.02, and that the six-year statute of limitations under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.13 had run as to many of the offenses. The court held that the conviction was proper. The evidence established that defendant used threats of killing the victim's mother to coerce her to have sex with him, satisfying the requirement of &quot;force&quot; under the rape statute. The fact that some of the abuse occurred in the county in which defendant was tried satisfied the venue requirement of &sect; 2901.12. The statute of limitations had been tolled under &sect; 2901.13(D) because defendant had engaged in a continuing course of conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for rape and gross sexual imposition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant jogging beside another jogger. Defendant was out in the roadway about three feet jogging beside another person who was jogging next to the side of the road.

Defendant argued that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. In affirming the conviction, the court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court found that the ordinance was sufficiently definite to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that her contemplated conduct was forbidden by the ordinance. The court also found that the ordinance was not overly broad because it applied only to persons on public streets who caused hazardous conditions, whether actual or imminent, or who interfered with the free passage of traffic.</SPAN></P>

The trial court later granted the school district's motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that the denial of the parents' claim for reimbursement of student transportation expenses was proper because &sect; 3327.01, was constitutionally valid, as its classification of students was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose, which was to provide means of access to educational facilities for students while not unduly burdening the resources of the school district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was informed that his driver's license was immediately being suspended, pursuant to Ohio Rev.

Code &sect; 4501:1-1-16(B), which provided that a person who was found guilty three times in three years of driving while under the influence of alcohol was an alcoholic, was unconstitutional as being violative of due process. The court held that Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4501:1-1-16(B)(1) was constitutional. Although it appeared to create a conclusive presumption that would be violative of due process at trial, it defined the word &quot;alcoholic&quot; so that the word had a consistent meaning and could be uniformly applied to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.08. The legislature, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.08, placed certain limitations upon the authority of the registrar of motor vehicles to grant a driver's license, including a prohibition against issuing a driver's license to an alcoholic. This public interest consideration was substantial in light of national highway statistics reflecting that the greatest danger on the public highway was the drinking driver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with and convicted of possession of a dangerous drug that required a prescription that, when mixed with another drug and injected into the blood stream, produced an effect similar to heroin. On appeal, defendant argued that the statute did not apply to him because he was not engaged in the legitimate business of drugs. He further argued that the statute violated due process and equal protection rights. Finally, he argued that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to grant him a continuance to obtain the testimony of a defense witness. The court rejected all of defendant's arguments except the one related to his claim that the statute violated his right to due process found in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The court found that the presumption in the statute, which allowed the jury to presume an intent to sell the drug from the fact of possession of the dangerous drug unconstitutionally reduced the State's burden of proof. Here, the court simply noted that there was no rational connection between the proven fact of possession and the presumed fact of intent to resell.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Upon inspection, the librarian saw defendant's picture on the license with a phony name, address, and date of birth and confiscated it. The trial court overruled defendant's motions for acquittal and found him guilty of attempted possession of criminal tools. Defendant contended that there was insufficient evidence of his purpose to use the false identification criminally. Possession of a fictitious driver's license fit under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24(A)(2) since any unofficial alteration of a driver's license made the article specially adapted for criminal use. However, the court reversed and held that the offense of possession of criminal tools could not be used to charge a person for possessing a fictitious driver's license. Defendant's conviction under &sect; 2923.24, which proscribed the same conduct as Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.30(A) but provided a higher punishment, was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with soliciting or procuring another to discard litter in violation of &sect; 3767.32.

Specifically, defendant claimed that the terms &quot;paper&quot; and &quot;unsightly&quot; as used in &sect; 3767.32 were vague in that they did not provide a clear indication of what was prohibited. The court held that a person of ordinary intelligence would not have to strain to determine when a paper product would be considered &quot;unsightly&quot; in the context of &sect; 3767.32. The term must be considered within the context of the entire definition. Accordingly, the statute was not vague. The court further rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 3767.32 was overbroad on the basis that it prohibited every single activity aimed at the general dissemination of information. The court determined that the definition of litter did not include every piece of paper. Even if &sect; 3767.32 might inhibit an individual's right to freedom of expression in a few cases, such effect was not substantial and was clearly outweighed by society's interest in stopping litter. Accordingly, the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court erred in holding that it lacked jurisdiction over the due process claims. The employee was not estopped from adjudicating the due process and breach of contract issues based on a contrary decision of the trial court because the decision did not discuss the evidence or contain findings of fact and conclusions of law to show that the issues were actually litigated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals were charged by indictment with willful misapplication of funds and unauthorized acts in violation of Ohio Rev.

Specifically, the individuals were alleged to have knowingly made or caused to be made false representations in an offering circular and incorporated materials by overstating that the bank's shareholders' equity, and in failing to disclose negative directives. An investigation by the Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of Savings and Loan Associations resulted in a finding that repurchase agreements made by the bank were overcollateralized and that a merger approval was gained without disclosing to regulator's the status of the bank's registration statements. Upon review of their convictions and subsequent assessed costs, the court upheld convictions as to several counts but determined that the individuals were prejudiced by a denial of a challenge for cause of a juror.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A referee concluded the domestic relations court could not modify a hospital's statutory duty to comply with wage withholding orders of foreign states pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3113.214. The Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, Domestic Relations Division (Ohio) adopted the referee's findings and dismissed appellant father's motion for a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction. The father sought review of that decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not consider whether a temporary restraining order should have been granted since it believed it lacked jurisdiction to grant such a motion, but the court held that the trial court had possessed jurisdiction to rule on the motion for a temporary restraining order. Since consideration of a Ohio R. Civ. P. 65(A) motion was committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, the court declined to speculate as to how that court might have exercised its discretion. The court agreed that Cuyahoga County, Ohio Ct. C.P. R. 31 was not the proper vehicle for modifying a Michigan support order when the Michigan court had not relinquished jurisdiction. The court perceived no substantive reasons why the issues were not appropriately decided in Michigan, as the support order originated there and its courts possessed the necessary expertise in dealing with a claim of accord and satisfaction. The court stated that since the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3113.214 was not necessary to its disposition of the case it would adhere to the principle of appellate review that constitutional questions would not be decided until the necessity for their decision arose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order which denied the father's petition to adopt the foreign judgment, reversed the decision not to consider his motion for a temporary restraining order, and remanded the case to the trial court so that it could consider that motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) in which he was convicted of offering to sell a controlled substance in an amount equal to or exceeding three times the bulk amount, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(7). The trial court denied defendant's request for a continuance, finding that defense counsel knew that an informant existed. Defendant set forth 14 assignments of error on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the day before trial, the State amended its witness list to include the informant. Because defendant was unlikely to take the stand for another two days, and because defense counsel acknowledged that he had read the informant's statement, the trial court denied the request for a continuance. On appeal, the court found that the prosecution complied with the mandates of Ohio R. Crim. P. 16. Defense counsel had ample time to investigate the informant, who was an integral player in the drug deal and was mentioned by every witness; thus, defendant's attorney could not claim that he was surprised by the existence of the informant. The court next held that the trial court properly utilized its discretion in allowing the State to elicit testimony from defendant that he resided at a drug rehabilitation center, without stating its address. Finally, sufficient evidence was clearly adduced from which a rational fact finder could have concluded that cocaine was a controlled substance and that defendant offered to sell it. The court noted that the provision in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03 making it a crime to offer to sell a controlled substance had previously been declared constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for the execution of the sentence. The court ordered that a special mandate be issued directing the trial court to carry the judgment into execution. Because the conviction was affirmed, any bail pending appeal was terminated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employers requested reimbursement for benefits paid to employees who sustained allowed injuries and whose claims had been adjudicated by the Commission for handicap reimbursement. The Bureau did not reimburse the employers for the amounts exceeding each employer's assessments for handicap reimbursement because of an amendment to the handicap reimbursement law, which provided that the employers, in any year, could not receive credit in an amount greater than their assessments. After the amendment was enacted, the Commission enacted Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4121-3-28(G), which provided that the employers, in any year, could not receive credit in an amount greater than their handicap assessments. The employers sought writs of mandamus ordering the Bureau and the Commission to make full handicap reimbursement for the amounts requested. The employers argued that Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4121-3-28(G) was in conflict with the handicap reimbursement law and, thus, was null and void. The court held that the employers' challenge to the validity of &sect; 4121-3-28 presented the court with a request for a declaratory judgment, which the court had no original jurisdiction to hear.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the revocation of his probation by the Athens County Municipal Court (Ohio) and sentence of 630 days in state prison. Defendant had been convicted of assault, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.13; resisting arrest; and two counts of domestic violence, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.25. Defendant was again arrested for abusing intoxicants and resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After finding defendant guilty of the new charges, the trial court revoked defendant's probation and ordered him to serve the prior sentence of 630 days and a sentence of 270 days on the new charges in state prison pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.41(E). Defendant contended that incarceration in a state prison for prior misdemeanor convictions was a violation of due process and constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Because the record was silent as to any mention of the constitutional issue before the trial court, the issue was waived. Defendant contended it was an abuse of discretion to impose a sentence on misdemeanor convictions in excess of 18 months as prohibited by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.41(E)(4). The judgment was not the basis for reversible error because &sect; 2929.41 was self-executing. Defendant argued that, while assault and domestic violence were classified by statute as violent crimes, it was an abuse of discretion to confine defendant in a prison. Both domestic abuse and assault were misdemeanors of the first degree and were defined by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.01(I) as per se offenses of violence. All the conditions set forth in the statute were satisfied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendant's assignments of error were without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Middletown Municipal Court (Ohio) for impersonating a peace officer in violation of Middletown, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 606.25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pulled over a car of teenage girls and identified himself as a police officer. On appeal, he contended that &sect; 606.25 was unconstitutional and beyond the scope of the town's police power because it lacked a scienter requirement, and that it was vague and overbroad. Construing Middletown, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect;&sect; 606.07(b), 606.25(b) together, a person acted with sufficient culpability to commit the offense of impersonating a peace officer if he acted recklessly. Accordingly, the court found that the ordinance adequately defined an offense and did not exceed the scope of Middletown's home rule police power. Section 606.25 clearly defined the conduct that was prohibited and was worded with sufficient definiteness so as not to encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement; thus, it was not vague or unconstitutionally overbroad because it infringed upon freedom of speech. The trial court's refusal of a continuance was not unreasonable or arbitrary and thus was not an abuse of discretion. It was not unfair for the trial court to give defendant the maximum sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former employee filed suit against appellees, a university and officials, alleging various causes of action relating to the termination of his employment with the university and intentional torts. The university filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Mahoning County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) dismissed the university but held the dismissal motions of the officials in abeyance. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was substituted in the action by his estate, which argued that it was error to apply Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.02(F) retroactively to hold the employee's claims against the officials in abeyance, pending the outcome of his action against them in the Court of Claims. Section 2743.02(F) required that claims against state officers, which alleged that the officers acted outside the scope of their employment, had to be filed first in the Court of Claims. The court disagreed, holding that even though the complaints in this case were filed before &sect; 2743.02(F) was adopted, the statute applied to proceedings that took place after its adoption and, as such, the application of the provision was not retroactive. The court also rejected the contention that the Court of Claims Act violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. If the remedies provided in the Act could compensate the employee's estate for the loss he suffered, then they were sufficient to satisfy Due Process. Lastly, the court held that the trial court erred in holding the claims against the officials in abeyance. The better practice was to stay the proceedings upon appropriate terms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. However, the order was modified to provide that the proceedings against the named officials were stayed until the Court of Claims determined whether any of the officials acted manifestly outside the scope of their employment or with malicious purpose and bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner so as to void their immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the trial court (Ohio), which convicted him of two counts of gross sexual imposition with two minor females in violation of Ohio Rev.

Defendant alleged that the videotape deposition procedure violated his right to confront the witnesses under the Sixth Amendment and that even though he completed his term of incarceration the appeal was not moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.41, the trial court permitted the deposition testimony of the two girls to be videotaped and presented at trial. The trial court convicted defendant under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.05. The court reversed. The State's failure to timely appoint appellate counsel resulted in defendant's release from prison prior to the court's review. The court did not find the appeal to be moot. The videotape procedure permitted defendant the opportunity to cross-examine the girls. His motive to cross at the taping was similar to that he would have had at trial. The court found that the psychologist's testimony was insufficient to support a finding that the girls would experience serious trauma as a result of testifying face-to-face with defendant in the courtroom. The psychologist was absent from the actual videotaping testimony. Thus, the court held that he was unable to predict how the girls might react when faced with defendant in person. Further, he only spent 45 minutes with them and had not been acquainted with them previously. The court held that the facts did not reflect the necessity of employing the videotape procedure authorized by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he raised 29 assignments of error, including that the trial court denied him a right to a fair trial by joining two indictments for purposes of trial. Defendant also claimed that the trial court committed prejudicial error in failing to sustain his motion to suppress evidence. The court affirmed defendant's conviction on all counts, holding, inter alia, that joinder was permitted pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 8(A) if certain conditions were met. However, if defendant showed prejudice as a result of the joinder, he was entitled to a severance under Ohio R. Crim. P. 14. Defendant failed to show prejudice as a result of the joinder, and he was not entitled to a severance. Evidence was not excludable as it was obtained in the reasonable good-faith belief that a search or seizure was in accord with U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that the juvenile was admitted to the detention center with suicidal tendencies, of which appellees were warned, and that his suicide by hanging was a direct and proximate result of the appellees' negligent failure to use reasonable care to prevent his suicide. Further, the administratrix alleged that, as a direct and proximate result of the appellees' deliberate indifference to the juvenile's safety, he was deprived of his civil and constitutional rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. In granting summary judgment, the trial court found that there was absolute judicial immunity from any civil damages alleged as a result of an order of placement by the juvenile court, and that such judicial immunity resulted in absolute quasi-judicial immunity for those acting pursuant to the order of placement. Reversing, the court held that the administratrix's allegations concerned the numerous acts performed in the day-to-day administration of a juvenile detention center, which were not &quot;intimately associated&quot; with the judicial phase of the criminal process. Thus, the allegations did not support a finding of quasi-judicial immunity.</SPAN></P>

Defendants then fired their attorneys and moved to withdraw their guilty pleas. The Common Pleas Court, County of Summit (Ohio) denied the motions to withdraw. Defendants appealed from the ruling arguing that the RICO statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2923.32 violated the Ex Post Facto Clause and failed to set forth ascertainable standards of guilt. The court maintained, however, that because the RICO statute required that that at least one illegal act occur after the effective date of the statute, the Ex Post Facto Clause was not violated. The court held that &sect; 2923.31 specifically included definitions of pattern and of corrupt activity, and therefore, was not vague. Defendants argued that the trial court committed prejudicial error by sentencing them to forfeiture in their absence. Defendants were not present at a sentencing of criminal forfeiture as to the personal property that was forfeited. Therefore, the court agreed that defendants' rights under the federal and Ohio constitutions were violated. Defendants argued that the trial court committed prejudicial error in not having them present for the hearing on the motion to withdraw their pleas of guilty. The court found that because the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on defendant's motions, the refusal of the trial court to allow defendants to be present at the hearing denied them a meaningful opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the matter for rehearing on defendants' motions to withdraw their guilty pleas. The sentencing of criminal forfeiture as to personal property was vacated and remanded for sentencing in defendants' presence. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The lower court granted appellees' motions for summary judgment, and the taxpayer sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the judgment of the lower court. The court found that the lower court properly held that the taxpayer lacked standing to bring this action because the taxpayer had only a remote association with Ohio's racing industry, had never been a racing permit holder, had never held a license issued by the racing commission, and had never been a racehorse owner. In addition, the taxpayer failed to demonstrate that the tax abatement program failed to accomplish its stated goal of benefiting the public. The court reversed the award of attorney fees in favor of appellees, and remanded the case for a determination as to which appellee was entitled to the fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother, an Iowa resident, filed a petition in an Iowa court to establish the individual's paternity. The Iowa court ordered a certificate to be filed in the trial court pursuant to the Ohio Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 3115. After genetic tests were ordered for the individual, the mother, and the child, the individual's counsel was granted a request to withdraw as counsel and the individual elected to proceed without counsel. The trial court adjudged the individual to be the father of the child and to have a duty of support, which was ordered. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to grant a new trial in order to allow the individual to obtain a blood test from another person with whom, the individual alleged, the mother also had sexual relations. The court stated that the individual's argument ignored that fact that not only was he aware of his right to counsel, but also chose to proceed unrepresented. The court concluded that the individual's claim was without merit because he was seeking, through a new trial, matters that, with diligence, could have been raised before trial.</SPAN></P>

After defendant pled not guilty, he was deemed competent to stand trial based upon a competency evaluation. On appeal, the court held that the Ordinance was not unconstitutional because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 715.67 was not a general law within the meaning of Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3 and did not operate as a limitation upon the penalties that a municipality may have imposed through its ordinances. The Ordinance validly imposed a penalty exceeding that stated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 715.67. The court concluded that there was no requirement that the trial court state affirmatively on the record findings indicating compliance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.12 and that there was a presumption that the trial court considered the factors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators sought to prohibit the judge from exercising his jurisdiction to determine the common level assessment for real property in the county for a certain tax year or from determining whether the real property in the county was valued properly. The court referred the case to a referee, who recommended dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim for relief in prohibition, and the court adopted the referee's recommendation because relators' prayer was not an appropriate request for prohibition. Their petition should have been directed to the judge's consideration of a particular matter pending before him, rather than to a general order not to consider or determine the issue in the abstract. They should have sought relief from the judge first. Even though the judge could not, upon an appeal from the Board of Revision, determine the factual accuracy of the Board of Equalization's action in adopting the common level of assessment, the judge did have jurisdiction to determine whether the auditor or the Board of Revision unconstitutionally applied the common level of assessment in determining the taxable value of the property in question.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the charges relating to vicious dogs because the statute was vague as to the definition. The State appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the statute failed to pass muster under either prong of the test for vagueness. First, it was not written so that a man of common intelligence could understand what conduct was prohibited. Even dog experts could not understand what dogs would be affected by the statute. Second, it did not provide explicit standards that prevented arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Police officers in one county were enforcing the statute differently than those in another county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow initiated a wrongful death case against her deceased husband's employer, the power company, alleging an intentional tort. The trial court granted summary judgment to the power company.

The widow failed to show that the power company had knowledge that if the decedent were subjected to such dangerous condition, then harm to him would have been a substantial certainty and not just a high risk. The record failed to demonstrate the power company's necessary intent in violating a standard of care established by the National Electric Safety Code in order to permit the widow to maintain a claim for intentional tort against the power company. The court did not need to reach the question of the constitutionality of the retroactive application of Ohio Rev.

The court determined that the distinction drawn by &sect; 2927.01 would not result in arbitrary application and that the two standards therein provided a reasonable basis of classification for distinguishing between conduct punishable as a misdemeanor and that punishable as a felony. The court concluded that &sect; 2927.01 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

He later admitted to an officer that he had handled a small cash register stolen on the night of the murder and left it in the woods. The officer arrested him, charged him with tampering with evidence, and had him fingerprinted at the jail. Officers found that the prints taken from defendant matched fingerprints found at the crime scene. Defendant claimed that the lower court erred in denying his motion to suppress the fingerprint evidence and his motion to suppress certain incriminating statements. He also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence. The court held that (1) the fingerprint evidence was properly admitted because the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant for tampering with evidence, the taking of fingerprints was not a search, and the discovery of the fingerprint evidence was inevitable; (2) there was no Miranda violation because the officers notified defendant of his rights and stopped the interview when he asserted his right to counsel and because defendant himself later reinitiated the conversation; and (4) there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict.</SPAN></P>

Defendant refused to present any mitigating evidence at the sentencing phase of the proceedings pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2920.04(B). On appeal, the court held that the trial court was not required to take remedial action sua sponte based on defendant's failure to present mitigating evidence at sentencing. The court held that the trial court should have merged the two murder charges for sentencing purposes because they arose from one homicide. However, the court held that defendant was properly sentenced to death, reasoning that the jury could reasonably have found that defendant committed aggravated murder in the course of an aggravated burglary and that there were no mitigating factors as was evidenced by the trial court's findings set forth as required by Ohio Rev.

The Akron Municipal Court, Summit County (Ohio) entered judgment for plaintiffs. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A collision occurred between an automobile owned and operated by the insured and a transit authority bus operated by one of its employees. The insured's vehicle was damaged as a result of the collision. The insurer brought an action against the transit authority to recover the amount paid out to the insured for his damaged vehicle. The transit authority counterclaimed for damages to its bus resulting from the collision. The trial court found the transit authority 75 percent negligent and the insured 25 percent negligent. The trial court thus entered judgment for the insured and found that the transit authority could not recover on its counterclaim. On appeal the transit authority contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.05(B), which prohibited an insurer from bringing a subrogation action against a political subdivision including the transit authority, was constitutional. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court, adhering to its prior unreported opinion that adopted holdings that the statute was not rationally related to a legitimate State purpose, concluded that &sect; 2744.05(B) was unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

P. 12(H), defendant sought review of an order of the Common Pleas Court of Hancock County (Ohio), which denied his pre-trial motions to suppress evidence and to sever the counts charged in the indictment. Defendant was found guilty on his plea of no contest to three counts of felonious sexual penetration and four counts of sexual battery. The victim was defendant's adopted daughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, during a meeting at her high school with the police and her mother, disclosed that defendant had photographed her in sexual poses and that the photographs were stored in a file cabinet in the home in which the victim, her mother, and defendant lived. Defendant contended that his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution were violated when police proceeded to enter his home without a warrant but with his wife's consent and forced open the file cabinet. The court ruled that the seized photographs should have been suppressed because defendant had a legitimate expectation of privacy as to the file cabinet. He routinely kept the only keys to the locked cabinet on his person when he left the house and it could not be said that the wife exercised any control over the cabinet or had a sufficient property interest in it to justify her consent to a police search. Evidence obtained subsequent to the file cabinet search was not derivative and subject to suppression, however, because it was gained through independent lawful means.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment. The court observed that the landowner's proposed building construction was not to be used for the permitted purpose of alleviating an increase in the volume of his business, but rather for use as an independent auto dealership and used parts supplier rendering such proposal an unlawful extension of the nonconforming junkyard use. The court stated that the landowner failed to show how an expansion into auto sales, repair, and parts supply was incidental and necessary to the existing nonconforming junkyard use.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Industrial Commission of Ohio and its Administrator, sought review of the decision of the Franklin County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, several self-insured employers, under Ohio workers' compensation laws, regarding the application of the Handicap Reimbursement provision, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.343(F), as amended by S.B. 307, Gen. Assem. (Ohio).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employers filed a declaratory action alleging that the Commission was applying the newly amended Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.343(F) in an unconstitutional manner. The amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.343(F) limited the amount of reimbursement payments to a self-insured employer in the case where a qualified employee was injured where previously the payments were not limited. The trial court held that the Commission could not retroactively apply the amended &sect; 4123.343(F) to claims which arose prior to its effective date. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's holding that the statute could not be retroactively applied. However, the court sustained the Commission's claim that the trial court erred in concluding that &sect; 4123.343 did not apply to claims which arose prior to its effective date and that the law in effect on the date of a claimants' injury controlled the employers' right to reimbursement. The court held that the scope of the trial court's two findings was too broad and modified the trial court's judgment to reflect that &sect; 4123.343(F) could not be applied to limit already accrued rights or claims that where pending as of its effective date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's judgment in part, affirmed the judgment in part, and remanded the case for implementation of the modification of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio, appealed the decision of the Franklin County Municipal Court (Ohio), which sustained defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of an illegal warrantless arrest. The trial court also dismissed several charges against defendant including driving on the right side of the road in violation of Columbus, Ohio, City Code 2113.04.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer from a township observed defendant driving along a roadway outside of the township's jurisdiction. The officer followed defendant to his home and, when a city officer arrived, the two officers entered defendant's home and arrested him. Defendant was charged with driving off the right side of the road, operating a motor vehicle while under the influence in violation of Columbus, Ohio, City Code 2133.01(A), driving left of center in violation of a city ordinance, and resisting arrest in violation of a State statute. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence based on his illegal arrest by the two officers. The trial court also dismissed all four charges. On appeal, the State contended that the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion to suppress. The court found that the township officer had no jurisdiction to arrest defendant outside of his township. The court further found that although the trial court properly dismissed two of the charges against defendant, the two charges stemming from behavior prior to the illegal arrest, the driving left of center and driving off of the roadway charges, should not have been dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Though the employer knew the meat cuber was partially broken, the employee was still required to use the machine. The employee's fingers were injured when they became caught in the machine.

Section 4121.80(D) eliminated the right to a jury trial in intentional tort actions filed by employees against their employers. The court determined that &sect; 4121.80(D) was unconstitutional. Intentional tort actions filed by employees against their employers traditionally were actions heard by juries. Because a jury trial right existed at common law for intentional tort actions against employers, Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 5 guaranteed the continued existence of the right.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed plaintiff's claims against all defendants on the basis that he was not the personal representative of the estate of the decedent and thus he lacked standing to bring this claim. On appeal, plaintiff argued that the wrongful death statute created a denial of equal protection and due process of those real parties in interest who were not the personal representatives of the estate. However, the court noted that pursuant to Ohio R. App. P. 12(A), the court of appeals was required to pass on all errors assigned and briefed, but could not address constitutional claims that were not raised at the trial court level. Here, the court found that the constitutional argument was not raised in the complaint or subsequent memoranda. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the wife a divorce, ordered the husband to pay the wife child support in an amount less than the child support guideline amount, and established a visitation schedule for the parties' child. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its considerable discretion in its child support determination and noted that the trial court did consider that the parties were married for only a short period of time and that the child had always resided with the mother. The court also ruled that it would not consider factors that might have occurred since the trial court's judgment as those factors were outside the record of the appeal. The court ruled that the trial court's division of property was supported by substantial, credible evidence and that the award of temporary alimony was not an appealable order.

The passenger appealed only the judgment for the driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the accident, the passenger was married to the driver. When the driver stopped for a light, the passenger left her seat to retrieve something from a shelf behind the driver seat. When the light changed, the driver accelerated, and the passenger fell and struck her head on a table. The driver claimed that he was not aware that the passenger had not returned to her seat when he accelerated, and the passenger did not know if the driver was aware of that fact. The basis for the grant of summary judgment was apparently that the passenger failed to show that any existing duty was breached. The court held that summary judgment was proper and that, although the driver did owe a duty of reasonable and ordinary care to his passenger, he did not breach that duty. The record was devoid of any facts to show that the driver did not exercise reasonable and ordinary in the operation of the van or that he was negligent in another manner. Therefore, there was an absence of any genuine issue of material fact, and reasonable minds could only conclude, as a matter of law, that the driver did not violate his duty of care.</SPAN></P>

The court held that city health districts were given broad powers under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3709.20 to make orders and regulations for the public's health, including regulations regarding food establishments such as the store. Although Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 925.01 empowered the Ohio Department of Agriculture to regulate food establishments, the legislature did not intend for that law to preempt the area. When city and state regulations were irreconcilable, the special or the city regulation prevailed, unless the general statute was adopted later.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment enjoining the city department of health from enforcing its sanitary standards for food establishments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed a complaint after the employee fell through a walkway which ran alongside a coal handling conveyor at the place of his employment alleging that the employer and others were liable for the injury. It was alleged that the employer was liable under an intentional tort theory and appellants asserted negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty claims against the remaining parties. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of appellees, and the court affirmed. The court held that the conveyor belt was constructed by the manufacturer sometime in the 1920s. However, appellants argued that because the coke conveyor was constructed at a later date, or added onto the structure which already existed at the employer, there was an additional contractual duty imposed upon them to exercise due care. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.131 applied to defective conditions that arose due to improvements made to real property. Because the construction of the coke conveyor belt was an improvement to the entire structure, the 10-year statute of limitations was correctly applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to comply with federal requirements, the district, which consisted of the city and surrounding suburbs, agreed to construct intercommunity relief sewers in areas where the sewers would carry overflow generated by more than one community. The district decided that the project would be financed by all of its users. The city brought an action against the district seeking a declaration that it was exempt from the cost-sharing provisions of the district's plan. The trial court rejected the city's claim. On appeal, the court held that: (1) although the trial court improperly consolidated the case with prior cases arising out of the formation of the district, the reassignment of the case under Ohio Civ. P. Sup. R. (3)(B) was proper and therefore the improper consolidation was harmless, (2) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 6119.03 did not apply to the present case because the statute applied only to actions related to the creation of a sewer district, (3) the district's interpretation of the intercommunity relief sewers was proper because they were to carry sewage from many communities and were therefore not local sewers, and (4) this was a permissible interpretation of the regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient sued the dentist for malpractice. The common pleas court dismissed the case because the patient had failed to attach an affidavit of merit to her complaint, as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.42. The patient appealed, arguing that the jurisdictional prerequisite of &sect; 2307.42 violated due process and her equal protection rights. In affirming, the appellate court rejected the patient's constitutional challenge and ruled that the statute was rationally related to legitimate government interests in keeping health costs reasonable and reducing the number of frivolous malpractice claims. The statute did not impose an insurmountable burden on a plaintiff, but only required an affidavit that there was a good faith basis for the claim, similar to the requirement of Ohio R. Civ. P. 11. Liability was not required to be proven at the pleading stage and &sect; 2307.42 did not discriminate on the basis of wealth. Moreover, because it was enacted after the Modern Courts Amendment, Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 5, the statute did not violate that provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was severely injured when he became entangled in a ripsaw at a lumber company. Although the employee had discovered the sawmill manufacturer's name, the employee filed his products liability action against a &quot;John Doe&quot; corporation. More than two years after the accident, the employee named and served the sawmill manufacturer, a foreign corporation, as a defendant. The court reversed an initial award of summary judgment to the manufacturer by finding that the employee's claims were not time-barred due to the savings statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.15. The employee unsuccessfully tried to raise the constitutionality of &sect; 2305.15 on reconsideration. On remand, the common pleas court granted the manufacturer's second motion for summary judgment on that the ground that &sect; 2305.15 was unconstitutional and did not toll the two-year statute of limitations, which barred the employee's action. On appeal, the court affirmed by holding that the decision on the first summary judgment motion as to the running of the statute of limitations was not determinative of the second motion where the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 2305.15 had been raised for the first time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an altercation in a bar, defendant shot and killed the victim. The witnesses claimed that there was a break between the attack and the shooting. The court held that defendant was entitled to a new trial because he was entitled to a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.03. There was evidence to show that defendant was seriously provoked to kill and was under the influence of a sudden fit of rage. However, there was sufficient evidence for the conviction and death sentence given the witnesses' statements and inconsistencies in defendant's statements regarding the attack. The jury did not have to determine that defendant was not guilty of murder before it considered any lesser-included offenses. Defendant's murder of his father was an aggravating circumstance, which outweighed the mitigating circumstance of child abuse. Defendant's statements to his brother were inadmissible under Ohio R. Evid. 801(D)(1)(b), 803(1) because they were not made immediately after the murder, defendant had a motive to lie, and defendant was not subject to cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress. Thereafter, defendant entered a no contest plea. The court affirmed and held that defendant maintained that the officer acted arbitrarily because he refused to give him a reasonable opportunity to offer satisfactory evidence of his identity before arresting him. Defendant offered nothing more than his oral statement as proof of his identity. Ohio Rev.

As a result, the city brought criminal complaints against the consultants for violating &sect; 2329.04(F)(3).

On appeal, the court found that federal law preempted the ordinance. Pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act an employer could continue its business in the face of a strike and in doing so could hire replacements for its striking employees. In addition, the local interest exception was not applicable and did not aid the ordinance in withstanding preemption because the local interest exception did not apply where there was merely a potential for violence and the ordinance did not contain any language which sought to regulate violence or any threat of violence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The facts showed that the city mailed defendant a tax questionnaire regarding his residency and employment in the city but, after being provided extensions of time to respond, defendant ultimately refused to disclose any of the requested information. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in finding that he had failed to provide sufficient argument to support his motion to dismiss, which was based on his claim that disclosing the information sought by the tax authorities violated the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions. The court held that: (1) the power of municipalities to tax (and inspect records and documents pertinent thereto) flowed from Ohio Const. art. XIII, &sect; 6, and art. XVIII, &sect; 13; (2) the Ohio Revised Code contained an &quot;inspection provision&quot; analogous to the ordinance; (3) in determining the constitutionality of any ordinance, there was a presumption that the law in question was constitutional, and one who challenged the constitutionality of any law bore the burden of proof of showing the law to be unconstitutional; and (4) defendant failed to meet the burden of demonstrating how and where the subject statutes were constitutionally infirm.</SPAN></P>

Although the employee argued that &sect; 124.57 was unconstitutional because it violated equal protection, the court held that classified civil service employees did not constitute a suspect class as they were not defined by some immutable characteristic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each claim involved an accident between an individual insured by the insurer and a city employee. The insurer moved for partial summary judgment asserting that the provisions of Ohio Rev.

The insurer claimed on appeal that the municipal court erred in denying the insurer's partial summary judgment on its cause of action for declaratory judgment and in granting the city's motion to dismiss. The insurer argued that the municipal court should have entered an order declaring that &sect; 2744.05(B) was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court reversed the municipal court's judgment because it held that &sect; 2744.05(B) was indeed unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection of law.</SPAN></P>

In seeking review, defendant contended that the State did not show by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant had violated Ohio Rev.

The department of corrections filed a motion to dismiss, contending that the court of claims had no subject-matter jurisdiction because of the patient's failure to comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.42. The motion was granted. The patient appealed on the grounds that the court of claims erred in not liberally construing the complaint and that the patient's rights to access to the courts, due process, and equal protection were violated. Specifically, the patient argued that requiring him to produce a physician's affidavit pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.42(C) was unconstitutional because the patient's imprisonment foreclosed access to an amenable physician. The court affirmed because the patient could file an affidavit by the patient's attorney or by the patient himself in lieu of a physician's affidavit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' child was absent for seven months from school in one school year. Defendants were given several opportunities to remediate the situation and assistance was provided in obtaining an exemption from the law that his child attend school in order to bring defendants into compliance. While an application was completed, it was subsequently altered to avoid violation of professed religious beliefs that encompassed parents' rights to have their child excused from public school attendance. The altered application was rejected, and defendants were ultimately convicted of violating &sect; 2919.24. In affirming the convictions, the court found that the trial court had properly ruled that evidence pertaining to defendants' inability to obtain an exemption from the compulsory education law was irrelevant because &sect; 2919.24 imposed strict criminal liability and underlying reasons for causing the delinquency of one's child could only be raised by way of an administrative appeal. Further, the court found defendants failed to present a prima facie case that they had been singled out for prosecution due to their attempt to exercise First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, employee and his wife, challenged judgments of the Huron County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted the motion for summary judgment of appellee manufacturer and the motion to dismiss of appellee employer in appellants' suit to recover for injuries sustained while the employee was using equipment made by the manufacturer and supplied to him by his employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured when the pneumatically powered tool slipped out of the &quot;off&quot; position, causing an air hose he was untangling to throw him into the air. He filed suit against his employer and the manufacturer. The trial court granted summary judgment to the manufacturer and dismissed the claims against the employer. The court affirmed, finding that the complaint against the employer failed to state an intentional tort, as it merely stated that the employer might have modified the tool. The court also found that the manufacturer was not barred by res judicata nor collateral estoppel from presenting the issue of the employer's modification of the handle, because the trial court only addressed the employer's motion to dismiss and that issue was contained in the employer's alternate motion for summary judgment. It then concluded that the manufacturer was entitled to summary judgment because its expert stated that a defectively designed throttle handle made the tool unreasonably dangerous and that the manufacturer had never made that kind of handle, and the employee did not produce sufficient evidence to create a question of fact as to whether the manufacturer made the handle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, which dismissed appellants' intentional tort claim against the employer and granted summary judgment to the manufacture on the appellants' products liability claim.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 1531.02. The trial court imposed a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hunter admitted he detached the tag but did not know it was illegal to do so. The hunter entered a no contest plea. He argued that allowing conduct to be defined by a regulatory agency was an unconstitutional delegation of power. The court affirmed and found no unconstitutional delegation of power. The hunter further contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1531.02 was void for vagueness because it was not specific enough to put an ordinary person on notice of what conduct was prohibited. The court agreed that &sect; 1531.02 did not specifically set out the prohibited conduct. However, the reference to wildlife division orders in &sect; 1531.02 put the public on notice that there were regulations that governed the protection of wild animals. When Ohio Adm. Code 1501:31-15-11(U) was read, the prohibition was quite specific and not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state tax commissioner ordered the auditor to reassess and reappraise all of the property in the county. The auditor entered into a contract with an appraisal firm for the reappraisal of the property. Certain reports were made that indicated that the appraisal firm planned to inspect the interior of every home. The prosecuting attorney filed a declaratory judgment action after receiving many calls from citizens. The trial court granted the auditor's motion for summary judgment. The prosecutor appealed. The auditor sought to dismiss the appeal, contending that the county of common pleas did not have original jurisdiction over the action. The court held that the prosecutor had standing, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;309.12, to challenge the constitutionality of the auditor's actions. The trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the auditor because the auditor showed that the interior inspection of homes would have only been done by consent of the homeowners. The prosecutor failed to not set forth any specific facts to show that the reappraisal plan involved any constitutional violations. His evidence consisted of the unsubstantiated allegations of his pleadings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mayfield Heights, OH, Codified Ordinances &sect; 1189 provided that an occupier or resident of a residential district who used a commercial vehicle in his occupation had permission to store such commercial vehicle &quot;out of view, in a garage,&quot; but only overnight. The city received complaints from neighbors about vehicles being stored on the residential properties of the owners and cited them for keeping their commercial vehicles outside their residence and not in a garage. The owners claimed that they kept the vehicles parked &quot;out of view&quot; from the road and that the ordinance was arbitrary in requiring that they keep the vehicles in a garage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother obtained child support from the father but because there was no statutory authorization permitting the mother to obtain child support, the lower court denied her request for attorney fees. In the matter before the lower court, the mother argued that even if there was no statutory authorization for attorney fees, her right to equal protection required that she be awarded attorney fees because attorney fees were awarded to spouses who were seeking alimony in divorce proceedings. Upon appeal, the court reversed the lower court and held that by not providing attorney fees to mothers who obtained child support in paternity proceedings, the legislature created an irrational distinction between divorce proceedings and paternity proceedings. The court ruled that because both the divorce statutes and the paternity statute were designed to insure that noncustodial parents, and not the State, were to pay the cost of raising children, it violated both the Ohio and federal equal protection guarantees to allow attorney fees in divorce actions but not in paternity actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant complained that his property was forfeited without a hearing.

Section 2933.43(C) expressly required a forfeiture hearing to be held no later than 30 days after a conviction. While defendant pled no contest to the facts charged in the indictment, there was no indication that his plea included a voluntary waiver of any forfeiture hearing. Absent a demonstration of waiver, the State was required to follow the procedure set forth in &sect; 2933.43(C). The record showed that the forfeiture was ordered without a hearing.

The child was the daughter of a deceased mother and was born of a marriage between the father and the deceased. The marriage was terminated and the deceased was granted sole custody.

Her living conditions were stable and she developed roots in the community and in her school. She indicated that she wished no further contact with the father. She was 15 years of age. Following the death of the deceased, the grandparents filed a petition to adopt the child. Service on the father was made by publication. An interlocutory decree was entered a month later and the adoption was made final. The court found that the record failed to disclose the required diligence in the attempt to locate and serve the father. However, the father had actual knowledge of the adoption. Under the informal procedure employed by the trial court and its acceptance of proffers and depositions, the father was able to present all the facts that could have been proven at a full-scale trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Hamilton County Municipal Court (Ohio), which convicted him of passing through a tunnel with a flammable load in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4921.32 after the trial court overruled defendant's motion to dismiss and after defendant entered a no-contest plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4921.32 involved an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). Defendant argued that the delegation of the authority to regulate interstate commerce from the Ohio Legislature to PUCO to the United States Department of Transportation was offensive to the separation-of-powers doctrine. This contention lacked merit because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4921.03, 4921.04, 4921.32 sufficiently set forth the legislature's policy and standards regarding PUCO's authority to regulate motor transportation carriers. Defendant also argued that Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4901:2-5-02, governing the transportation of hazardous materials by truck, was overbroad. Although the operator of a vehicle carrying hazardous material had to proceed to his destination without delay, he was also obligated to avoid tunnels. Thus, it was reasonable for the trial court to have concluded that taking a circuitous route to avoid a tunnel would not constitute a &quot;delay,&quot; as contemplated by 49 C.F.R. &sect; 177.853(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the initiative was not appropriate to repeal a &quot;tax measure&quot; and was an unconstitutional impairment of the obligation of the city's contractual relationships.

The court held that: (1) the city's duty under the charter was to certify the initiative ordinance to the board of elections so that it could be placed on the ballot; (2) the constitutionality of the initiative ordinance could not be judicially determined until after its enactment and the initiative ordinance did not violate U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife contended that the trial court had erred in its award of martial assets, especially in granting the husband more than a one-half interest in a family business and in allowing him to make monthly payments to her for some assets without interest. She argued that the factors listed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3105.18 did not support the award. The court rejected the wife's contention that the difference in the award to each party was sufficient to constitute an abuse of discretion. The court found that the trial court's award to the husband was based on specific, appropriate reasons. It also found that the trial court had balanced that award by granting alimony and all household goods to the wife. Given the totality of the circumstances, the court could not say that the trial court had abused its discretion in its award. However, the court agreed with the wife that the trial court had erred in requiring her to reimburse the husband for mortgage payments, real estate taxes, and utilities. Under &sect; 3103.03, the husband had a duty to provide for the wife during their marriage. The expenses had been incurred during the parties' separation, but while they were still married.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executor's decedent was killed when his plane struck a utility pole during the final approach to a runway. On appeal, the executor asserted it was error not to grant a directed verdict in her favor. The court noted that nothing in the record reflected that the executor moved for such a verdict based on the issue raised on appeal, and even if she had done so, reasonable minds could have arrived at differing conclusions and a directed verdict would thus have been inappropriate. The executor waived her right to challenge the constitutionality of a statute because when she voiced her objection to jury instructions on the statute, she did not challenge its constitutionality. She also had no standing to challenge the validity of the allegedly discriminatory statute because she did not demonstrate that she had an interest akin to that of a utility company in maintaining structures around an airport, nor did she show that she was in a position analogous to that of a county or an airport authority. The transcript did not state the reasoning for the trial court's decision to exclude an exhibit, and based on review of the briefs and record the court found no abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged 17 assignments of error, which included his arguments that his conviction was against the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, that his sentence should not have been enhanced, and that he should not have been fined. The court found that the trial court properly overruled defendant's motions for acquittal with respect to all eight counts of the two indictments because reasonable jurors could have concluded that all of the elements of each statute violated were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that defendant's prior conviction under former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.172 would not have constituted a felony under the law in effect at the time of his trial; therefore, the trial court should not have enhanced defendant's convictions under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03 since that section required a prior conviction for a felony. The court also found well-taken defendant's argument that, as an indigent, he should not have been fined pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(H) because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(L) precluded otherwise mandatory fines for such offenses.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the trial court properly excluded evidence of an alleged &quot;Mary Carter&quot; agreement under Ohio Evid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was previously convicted of public indecency and indecent exposure on four occasions. He failed to register as a habitual sex offender. Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 2950.02.

He also contended that the requirement constituted cruel and unusual punishment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother brought two paternity suits against the putative father but both resulted in a voluntary dismissal. Appellees then together brought a third suit against the putative father and after a trial on the merits, judgment was entered in their favor. The putative father sought review of the decision, arguing that the second voluntary dismissal constituted an adjudication on the merits under Ohio R. Civ. P. 41(A)(1) and that appellees were therefore barred on the basis of res judicata from bringing an action to determine the existence of a father-child relationship. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the child was not and could not have been joined as a party in the two prior suits. The court reasoned that the child had a separate and distinct claim from that of the mother and therefore the third suit on his behalf was not barred by res judicata. The court held that although the trial court erred by failing to determine whether the putative father was indigent and whether to appoint him counsel, the error was harmless. Given the rulings in the case prior to appointment of counsel, the court held that the putative father had not suffered any prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver and an insured were going in opposite directions when they passed one another on a highway. The driver was driving a truck for the car owner, and the insured was driving his personal automobile. As the insured passed, gravel from the driver's truck spilled out onto the roadway causing damage to the insured's car. The insured filed a claim with the insurer and was compensated. After paying the insured, the insurer sued the driver and the car owner claiming the right to do so under a subrogation provision in the insurance policy. The trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment on the grounds that &sect; 2744.05(B) prohibited a judgment for the insured. The court reversed and held that it was irrational for a state to deny insurance subrogees the opportunity to bring an action their subrogors could legally assert. Thus, the failure of &sect; 2744.05(B) to rationally connect the classification to a legitimate state purpose violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution and Ohio Const. art.

The court ruled that &sect; 2744.05(B) prohibited an action under a subrogation provision of an insurance contract against a political subdivision. The court ruled that in determining whether the statute was constitutional, the rational relationship test applied because the statute was an economic legislation that did not involve either fundamental constitutional rights or a suspect classification. The court found that the protected class was a political subdivision and that protection of the fiscal integrity of the state's political subdivisions was recognized as a legitimate government interest. The court ruled that for the state to limit the fiscal impact upon political subdivisions by permitting tort claims to be made against them only to the extent that a collateral source of payment did not exist and by barring subrogation claims with respect to such collateral source payments was a legitimate state purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union filed a petition with SERB to conduct an election for a bargaining unit consisting of employees of the employer, a juvenile detention center. The employer opposed the election. SERB determined that the employees were public employees and recommended that an election be held. The employer appealed to the trial court. On appeal, the court held that the trial court had jurisdiction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12 to hear the employer's appeal because SERB was an administrative agency whose decisions were subject to judicial review. Regarding the issue of whether the employees were indirect employees of the juvenile court, the court held that because there was no reference to an indirect employee in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 4117, the trial court erred in creating that classification. The court further held that the employees were not officers of the court because they had no independent decision-making authority; they could only render non-binding recommendations to the juvenile court; and the judges did not exercise the requisite degree of control to bring the employees within the purview of &sect; 4117.01(C)(8).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another were arrested after 19-year-old woman was found dead in defendant's home. The victim, who had been severely depressed and unable to care for herself, had been repeatedly abused, but the coroner determined that death had resulted from natural causes due to an infection from bedsores. Seventeen months later, the coroner amended the death certificate and autopsy protocol, in accordance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3705.04, and ruled that the death was a homicide caused by an infection due to blunt force trauma. The court, in affirming the convictions, first found that the child endangering statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.22(B), was not unconstitutionally vague merely because it did not define &quot;handicapped&quot; and concluded that the victim's limited function rendered her subject to the statute's protection. Next, the court found that defendant was not prejudiced by the admission of the amended death certificate where she had not offered any evidence to refute the matters contained therein. Finally, the court found substantial evidence to support the verdict and further found that defendant failed to object to a jury instruction and thus waived the issue on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under &sect; 742.08(A), members of the Board were not to be paid compensation for their duties, but an employee member could not suffer a loss or penalty because of his absence from his regular employment while engage in official duties as a member of the Board. The city argued that municipalities had the authority to exercise all powers of local government and that &sect; 742.08(A) violated its power of local self-government. The court disagreed. The creation and administration, management and control of a state pension fund, as provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 741.01 et seq. was a valid enactment of the Ohio General Assembly by virtue of the provision of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 34. Thus, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 742.08(A) fell within the General Assembly's authority to enact employee welfare legislation. The home rule provision could not be interposed to impair, limit, or negate the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner initiated the declaratory judgment action and filed a mandamus complaint against the Board contending that the referendum election regarding single-family residence zoning classification was unreasonable, arbitrary, and confiscatory. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the landowner sought review. The court found that a certificate of election was conclusive as to the result of the election until it was set aside or vacated in some manner authorized by law. The court further determined that, although the certificate was not conclusive when directly attacked, it was prima facie evidence of the matters certified therein. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 305.32, a referendum petition could have been presented in separate petition papers as long as each petition paper contained a full and correct copy of the title and text of the resolution sought to be referred. Further, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 303.12, amendments to the zoning resolution could have been initiated by the passage of a resolution by the Board of County Commissioners. The court found that the zoning classification was not unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The widow received workers' compensation benefits for her husband's death. The trial court granted the employer's motion for summary judgment on the basis that the widow's acceptance of workers' compensation benefits constituted an election of remedies against the employer and barred her intentional tort claim. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(H) altered the definition of an intentional tort but its retroactive application violated the Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. On appeal, the widow contended that the trial court erred in failing to vacate the summary judgment and in failing to reinstate her cause of action. The court first held that the widow's current challenge was timely because her notice of appeal was filed within 30 days of the date that the summary judgment because a final appealable order, pursuant to Ohio R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of raping his six-year-old daughter, as well as penetrating her vagina with a curtain rod. During trial, the lower court admitted the testimony of the victim pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2907.41, which had been taken by means of a videotaped deposition. The trial court also admitted testimony of the victim's counselors, who restated the victim's accounts of the assault. On appeal, defendant contended that these admissions were error. The court agreed, and reversed for a new trial. The court first held that the trial court erred by admitting the victim's videotaped testimony. The trial court wrongfully presumed that the victim would be traumatized by face-to-face testimony, and did not make a sufficient finding of necessity to warrant the abrogation of defendant's Sixth Amendment rights in this case. The court further erred in admitting the hearsay statements of the victim because the State did not claim that the victim was unavailable as a witness.

Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.41(A)(1), defendant had the right to attend the deposition of the child witness and had the right to be represented by counsel at such deposition. The court held that the deposition was admissible at the trial if it was not excluded by the hearsay rule and if such deposition was otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence. Under the Sixth Amendment, defendant had the right to confront the witnesses against him. The court found that Ohio Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners commenced an action against the city, seeking a declaration that the residential zoning classification of their properties was unconstitutional as applied.

The trial court agreed that a portion of Parma, Ohio Ordinance &sect; 1229.01 conflicted with the initiative and referendum scheme set forth in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;1(f) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 731.29. The court agreed that the city, as a non-chartered municipality, was not permitted to deviate from statutory requirements of initiative and referendum. The additional requirement of ward approval was in conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 731.29 and had to be stricken from Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1229.01. Further, the enabling legislation,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 731.28 et seq., did not supersede the constitutional provision, Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 1(f).

Each appellant asserted on assignment of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the claimant's first discrimination charge filed with the OCRC was denied, he filed a second claim. The OCRC found no probable cause to issue a complaint and dismissed the charge. The claimant filed petitions seeking judicial review of the decisions of the OCRC and he requested trial de novo. The trial court granted his motion. Appellants argued the trial court erred to their prejudice, in granting a trial de novo. On appeal, the court agreed, and reversed and remanded the trial court's order. The court held the standard for judicial review of an order of the OCRC finding no probable cause and dismissing a complaint for discrimination, was whether the OCRC's determination was irrational, unlawful, arbitrary or capricious. The court determined there was no provision in the statutory scheme for a trial de novo in the trial court. The court held Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4112.05, 4112.06 were proper exercises of legislative authority which did not violate the right-to-remedy provisions of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>

The probation officer arrested defendant and found marijuana in his car. The trial court revoked its previous rehabilitation order and sentenced defendant for the original drug abuse charge. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the person who listened in on the phone extension, which resulted in defendant's arrest, had violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.52, but that did not preclude the admission of the marijuana obtained as a result of the violation. The court was satisfied that the privacy rights of defendant remained protected and did not violate the exclusionary rule because it did not involve government officials.

The trial court granted defendants' motions to suppress the results of their BAC tests under Ohio R. Crim. P. 12(B)(3) because the procedures required by Ohio Admin Code &sect; 3701-53-02(C) for an RFI survey were not followed with regard to the BAC verifier that was used to test them. On appeal, the court held that although defendants were not entitled to suppression of the test results under Ohio R. Crim. P. 12(B)(3), the trial court should have granted their motions in limine to exclude the test results with regard to the charges of OMVI per se under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3). The court reasoned that the State's failure to substantially follow the testing procedures in Ohio Admin Code &sect; 3701-53-02(C) and the appendix did not render the tests unconstitutional, but their exclusion was warranted because RFI surveys were required in order to ensure the accuracy of BAC verifier machines.</SPAN></P>

While defendant was being given first aid, the police began an inventory search of his car. In the passenger area, the police found a leather case, which contained a vial of white powder. A travel bag that was found in the trunk contained two film canisters that each contained several packets of white powder. After he admitted to an officer that he had been drinking, defendant was arrested for operating under the influence and his blood was tested. Defendant made inculpatory statements following his arrest and after Miranda warnings were administered. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the white powder, cocaine, was discovered in the course of an administrative inventory conducted under a standardized procedure, not as the result of opening sealed or locked containers. The court held that the implied consent provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191 applied because defendant was arrested for although not charged with driving under the influence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the divorce decree, the husband was ordered to pay child support. The wife brought a motion to modify the husband's child support obligations. The matter was heard by a referee, who also considered the husband's oral motion to modify child expense payments. The referee awarded an increase in child support in accordance with child support guidelines and modified the medical expense payment. The referee did not make his award retroactive to the date the wife's motion was filed. The trial court confirmed the award. On appeal by both parties, the court affirmed. The needs of the children were properly presented through the child support guidelines set forth in Rule 75 of the Rules of Superintendence for the Courts of Common Pleas, Ohio. The guidelines did not usurp legislative authority. While Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.05 set forth various factors to be considered by a court in establishing the amount of child support, the guidelines were an attempt to establish uniform standards of support, and the guidelines were not rigid or mandatory. It was not mandatory that child support payments be retroactive to the date of filing the motion, and medical payments were support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant rented space in a barn to store his belongings. The police received a tip from a reliable source that defendant was storing stolen property in the barn. At the time the barn was for sale and the detective arranged to see the barn with a real estate agent. The detective and the agent were unable to go inside the barn because it was padlocked, but the detective could see a camper inside the barn. The serial number was run and indicated that the camper was stolen. The detective later obtained a search warrant and defendant was subsequently arrested. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the evidence that was found in the barn. On review, the court found that defendant had no subjective expectation of privacy regarding the barn. The court reasoned that defendant was never given a key to the property and that it was easily accessible from the back. Furthermore, the property was for sale and had visible signs indicating such on the property. Thus, it was subject to be viewed by the public. Therefore, the trial court's decision was reversed and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The Board was entitled to a presumption that its determination was valid, and the burden of showing the invalidity should have rested upon the party who contested it. The court found that the common pleas court did not err in finding that the Board's action was not unreasonable. The court found that the common pleas court did not err in holding that the granting of the variance was supported by a preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. Appellant alleged that the common pleas court erred in not issuing findings of fact and conclusions of law as requested.

The employee contended that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding the employer's knowledge of existing conditions or procedures within its operation which led to the employee's injuries.

Therefore, the employee failed to meet her burden of establishing that the employer had knowledge of a dangerous condition which was substantially certain to cause the employee's injuries.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner appealed the zoning board's decision to deny his application for permission to retain a nonconforming use to the board of appeals, which also rendered an adverse judgment. The owner's appeal to the trial court was dismissed pursuant to Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Ct. C.P. R. 28 for failure to file a brief, which was essentially a dismissal for failure to prosecute. The owner then filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the City, and contended that the fence conformed to the zoning code. The City moved to dismiss the complaint. The motion was granted, and the owner appealed. On review, the court held that the judgment dismissing the administrative appeal was a judgment on the merits as to the issue of the fence's conformity to the zoning code, and thus the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred the owner from relitigating the matter. The dismissal of the appeal did not adjudicate the owner's claims that the ordinance was unconstitutional, thus it was error for the trial court to dismiss the constitutional claims. However, the error was not prejudicial because the owner failed to properly pleas the constitutional issues in his complaint.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reversed the board's decision, stating that to the extent that &sect; 3702-2-03 enlarged the requirements of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the owner of a first lot, sought review of the judgment of the Washington County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which affirmed a decision of appellees, a township board of trustees and the trustees, ordering her to build and maintain a portion of a partition fence between her property and the property of appellants, co-owners of a second lot. The co-owners appealed the judgment with respect to the maintenance of the fence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board assigned portions of a partition fence to be built and maintained by the parties. In 1980, the parties appeared before the trustees disputing that order. The assignments were not recorded as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 971.12. In 1986, the co-owners filed a complaint with the board, which alleged that the owner had not built her share of the fence. Two trustees heard the case because one of the co-owners was a trustee. The parties presented conflicting evidence about whether the value of the owner's property would be enhanced by the fence. The board entered an order directing the owner to construct the fence and assigning portions for maintenance to the parties. On appeal to the trial court, the parties were allowed to present addition evidence. The trial court affirmed the board's order. On appeal, the court held that the evidence in the record and the conclusions drawn from that evidence were that the fence would provide some benefit, but that cost would exceed the benefit. Therefore, the owner should not have been required to build it. The trial court was not able to consider the 1980 fence assignments because they were not recorded as required by &sect; 971.12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court with the direction to enter final judgment in favor of the owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the employer as a feed inspector. While he was placing a bag on a freight elevator, a nut that attached an eyebolt to the elevator came off and caused the elevator and the employee to fall to the basement. Plaintiffs initiated an action against the employer that alleged the employee's injuries were the result of an intentional tort. The trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of the employer. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The trial court erroneously applied Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80, which imposed a more difficult standard for &quot;intent&quot; in workers' compensation intentional tort claims. Section 4121.80 was not to have been applied retroactively, pursuant to Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, when it constituted a limitation of a substantive right. However, summary judgment was still proper because plaintiffs failed to set forth specific facts that demonstrated there were genuine issues of whether the employer had knowledge of the dangerous instrumentality, whether the employee was subjected to a substantial certainty of harm, and whether the employer required the employee to perform the dangerous task.</SPAN></P>

The father failed to make some of the payments, and the mother sought an arrearage judgment. An agreed judgment was entered into. Subsequently, the father failed to make the payments through the child support agency, although he argued that he had made the payments directly to the mother. The trial court entered another arrearage judgment and found the father in contempt. The father appealed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the father had been given adequate notice that the payments had to be made through the support agency. There was sufficient evidence that an arrearage existed, even though the mother subsequently waived her right to receive the arrearage. It was not an abuse of discretion to sentence the father to 30 days in jail, reduced to 10, for his repeated failure to pay the support through the agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, a minor child's guardian ad litem, requested respondent judge to enjoin the dissemination of information about pending custody actions and to enjoin the provision of photographs, films, or interviews concerning the child. The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, Juvenile Division (Ohio), issued &quot;gag&quot; and &quot;closure&quot; orders.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and issued a writ of prohibition. The evidence was insufficient to permit a finding that either complete closure or an absolute gag order was necessary to protect compelling rights and interests or even that the presumption of openness had been overcome. The juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to issue a closure order unless it had afforded an opportunity to the parties and the media to be heard at a preclosure hearing and, upon proper supporting evidence, made a factual determination, peculiar to the actions, that the public or private rights and interests involved were so substantial and would be so adversely affected as to override the presumption of openness mandated by the Ohio and United States Constitutions. The juvenile court's sweeping orders were supported neither by evidence nor law. The constitutional right of freedom of the press and of speech included the right of access to civil and criminal trials. This was not just because U.S. Const. amend. I, as applied to the states by U.S. Const. amend. XIV, but also because Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 11, provided for this freedom of speech and press and required that courts be open.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and issued a writ of prohibition, in favor of the newspaper, prohibiting the judge from enforcing either the gag or closure orders unless and until the juvenile court had conducted an evidentiary hearing, made appropriate findings, and had tailored the orders to meet the specific needs and circumstances of the actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded no contest to a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.632, unlawful possession of beer by a minor, in order to preserve his right to appeal the constitutionality of the statute. On remand to the trial court, the trial court determined that the statute was constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court rejected defendant's arguments that the statute was facially vague or overbroad. The issue was whether or not the word &quot;possess,&quot; as it appeared in the statute, was unconstitutionally vague or indefinite. The court held that it was not because it gave defendant sufficient notice of what was proscribed by the statute. However, the court agreed that the statute was unconstitutionally applied to the facts of defendant's case, in that the only evidence of possession by defendant was that he had carried beer that was lawfully purchased from a store to a car. From those facts, the court held that it could not determine whether defendant had exercised the sort of control over the beer that amounted to illegal possession or control, as opposed to the mere carrying of the beer to the car.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defense counsel's decision not to pursue an insanity defense was an unchallengeable tactical decision. In addition, the court held that given the evidence presented by the state at the suppression hearing on the issue of consent, the trial court properly overruled appellant's motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to a permissive search of his apartment. As to appellant's challenge to certain statements made by the prosecutor, the court held that given the court's cautionary instruction regarding the statement, no error by the trial court was committed.

The regulation was enacted due to problems occurring at the amusement park's events prior to its enactment. The trial court denied the requested relief, finding that the amusement park had established a nonconforming use. The court affirmed, finding that under Ohio Rev.

The court held that under &sect; 519.02 the board could only regulate, inter alia, the uses of buildings and other structures and the uses of land, and the statute did not confer upon the board the authority to regulate the time within which otherwise permitted uses could occur.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's truck was seized at a repair shop after police and the sheriff's personnel found that the truck contained parts from a stolen truck. The truck was impounded but the prosecutor did not prosecute. The prosecutor advised the law enforcement agencies to return only those parts of the vehicle for which the owner could prove title. The owner demanded return of the entire vehicle. The parties agreed to release the truck for sale. The owner sought replevin and money damages for his loss of use of the vehicle. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendants and denied summary judgment to the owner. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the owner's vehicle, which included parts from other vehicles, created an illegal status in the property and the owner was not entitled to repossession of the entire vehicle. The court held that the police chief acted diligently in bringing an interpleader action to determine the proper ownership of the vehicle and its component parts. The court held that although criminal charges were not filed, the entire vehicle could not be returned to the owner and the owner was only entitled to parts which he possessed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the legislature had a right to abolish a cause of action if it furthered a permissible legislative objective.

The court found that the first trial court dictated its rationale the day after defendant's trial ended in mistrial. This transcript was filed with the record at the hearing on defendant's motion for dismissal on speedy trial and double jeopardy grounds. The court held that the ends of justice were adequately served because the court explained its rationale the day after granting defendant's motion for a mistrial. Furthermore, there was double jeopardy bar to retrial when a mistrial is granted at the defendant's request. Defendant also argued that the second trial court committed prejudicial error because it overruled defendant's motion to suppress evidence. The affidavit was submitted four months after observation of the criminal conduct. The court held that there was evidence of a continuing course of conduct; therefore, the affidavit was not stale.</SPAN></P>

Specific projects within the district could be constructed as needed. Notice by certified or first class mail under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 6117.06(B) was only necessary if the owners of the property were listed for current agricultural use valuation and not located in an agricultural district. The residents did not state that they met this requirement. Certified or first-class mail was sent to every owner of property to be assessed. All others were notified by publication notice. Because there was no assessment and the residents were not agricultural property owners, the residents did not show that the notice by publication and the hearing were inadequate. Special notice only to owners of land valued for current agricultural use did not violate equal protection guarantees. A separate fund was not needed because no amounts were yet set or collected. The county was not precluded from establishing user fees to retire capital debt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the State of Ohio, filed suit against defendants, a hazardous waste disposal corporation and its president, seeking penalties for alleged violations of, inter alia, Ohio Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 3745-66-71 and 3745-66-17(A). Defendants counterclaimed, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The State and defendants appealed various judgments from the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial resulted in the entry of judgment for the State on counts seven and 15, and judgment for the corporation on the remaining counts. The trial court also dismissed defendants' counterclaim. The court found that the entry of judgment for the State on count seven was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3745-66-71 did not, as the allegation suggested, expressly proscribe the storage of hazardous waste in containers that leaked or were not in good condition. The conclusion of the trial court that such an incident constituted a violation of &sect; 3745-66-71 was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. The court also found that entry of judgment for the State on count 15 was erroneous. Count 15 charged the corporation with failing to take adequate precautions to prevent accidental ignition of ignitable waste in violation of Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3745-66-17(A). The court concluded that the ignition occurred because of the action of the corporation's foreman and the corporation could not be held vicariously liable. Finally, the court concluded that defendants fairly stated a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the judgment entered against the corporation and in favor of the State on counts seven and 15. The court also reversed that portion of the judgment, which dismissed defendants' counterclaim, and remanded the matter for further proceedings. Having determined that the challenges presented on appeal by the State were not well taken, the court affirmed the balance of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court declared &sect; 6.04 of the city charter unconstitutional. The trial court stated that the city board of health was a political subdivision of the state and that board of health employees were not city employees. The health board and city appealed. In reversing, the court declared &sect; 6.04 constitutional and held that municipal local self-government power extended to creating a board of health which differed in structure from that set forth by statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3709.05, which thus &quot;anticipated&quot; this development. Also, as a state agency a board of health's employees, absent legislative authority, were free from municipal control. A chartered home rule municipality may create a board of health that differs in structure from that set forth in state statute as long as the board was established and maintained under authority of municipality's charter, had no extraterritorial effect, and was not an exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner held unimproved land that was in two different zoning classifications and requested that it be rezoned to Planned Development PD. He argued that the Residence A zoning was unconstitutional as applied to the land. On appeal, the court reversed. The trial court applied the correct standard for determining the constitutionality of the ordinance, however, its ruling was improper as it applied to the zoning classification upon annexation and the ordinance was unconstitutional as it applied to the property. The property owner did have the burden of establishing beyond fair debate that the ordinance did not bear a substantial relationship to the protection of the health and safety of the area. The trial court relied on improper considerations when it determined that the City had no need for further business development and it erred in finding the existence of a comprehensive community plan. The property owner did present evidence that the zoning restriction was unreasonable and arbitrary as applied to its land when it established that it was not economically feasible to develop the property for residential use under the current zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city imposed a three percent cinema admissions tax. The court previously upheld the facial constitutionality of the tax. The city then enacted an ordinance that authorized an entertainment admission tax. The tax applied to all places in the city offering entertainment and demanding an admission price, except cinemas. The amusement company's complaint alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to it and sought a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was void and unenforceable. The city alleged that the trial court erred failing to find that the doctrine of res judicata was a bar to the prosecution. The court agreed and determined that the issues that were before the trial court should have been brought before the trial court in the amusement company's suit challenging the validity of the cinema admissions tax. The court held that the trial court erred in holding that a tax on all cinemas with the city was unconstitutional when all the cinemas were taxed at the same rate and when there was evidence showing justification for the tax. The court found that the city was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

The landowner challenged the lower court's denial of attorney fees and prejudgment interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies obtained a permit from the city and, contiguous to the landowners' property, constructed an apartment complex. The new elevation of the developed land caused the landowner's property to frequently flood. On appeal of the lower court's award of damages to the landowner against the city and the companies, the court ruled that the city could be held liable for the negligent issuance of a building permit. The court ruled that the question of the city's negligence was properly set before the jury. The court also ruled that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the law. The court ruled against one company in its assertion that because the development was approved by the city, the company could not, as a matter of law, be found negligent. The court ruled that the reasonableness of what was done with the surface water, irrespective of the existence of a building permit, was a question for the jury. The court found that the landowner was properly denied attorney fees and prejudgment interest because his action was not for the public good. Finally, the court found that the damages, though high, did not shock the sensibilities of the court and were, thus, upheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court that found that city and the companies liable to the landowner and denied the landowner attorney fees and prejudgment interest.</SPAN></P>

The employee sought workers' compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a police officer, and while she was at roll call and during weapons' inspection, her weapon accidentally discharged. The bullet struck her commanding officer. Later that day, the employee experienced an adverse emotional reaction to the incident and sought treatment at the hospital. About three years later, the employee requested a medical leave of absence for post traumatic stress disorder. She filed workers' compensation claim, which was administratively denied. On appeal, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the employer. The court found that a worker's substantive right to compensation was measured by the statute in force on the date of the worker's injury. As such, the trial court applied the wrong version of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.01(C). It applied the version, which was amended in August 1986. Under that version, psychiatric conditions were expressly excluded from compensation. However, despite this error, the trial court reached the proper decision. While a physical injury caused by mental or emotional stress, arising out of employment was compensable, a mental condition caused solely by mental or emotional stress was not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband sought review of the decision from the trial court (Ohio), which found that the challenged legislation was constitutionally valid. The husband had filed a declaratory judgment action contesting the constitutionality of the two percent fee charged by appellee Bureau of Support for processing his alimony payments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the divorce, policy permitted direct payments and the husband made timely direct alimony payments to his former spouse. The court policy changed and the husband paid his monthly alimony payments through the Bureau of Support accompanied by poundage in the amount of $ 170 per month. The trial court found that Montgomery County, Ohio, Ct. C.P. Dom. Rel. Div. R. 4.01, and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2301.35, 2301.36 had a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state concern and that the two percent fee required by the legislation did not constitute the imposition of a tax. On appeal, the court found that the poundage fee paid by the husband was not commensurate with the service provided of processing the payments, but noted that the stated statutory purpose of the fee was to pay part of the cost of support enforcement. The statutory classification of support obligors did not manifest a patently arbitrary classification, utterly lacking in rational justification. The rule requiring all support obligors to pay support through the bureau was related to a legitimate state interest. The husband's remedy was with the general assembly and not with the courts.</SPAN></P>

Investigation of the open beer container subsequently resulted in the discovery of an unloaded revolver in the possession of defendant. Defendant filed a motion to suppress oral statements and a motion to suppress evidence as a result of an alleged unlawful search and seizure that resulted in the discovery of the revolver in his truck. The trial court denied defendant's motions to suppress. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in overruling his motions to suppress. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and found that there was probable cause for the investigatory stop. Although defendant's revolver was unloaded, the possession of the revolver in a truck fell within the parameters of carrying concealed weapons as prohibited by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12. Defendant had been previously convicted for the offense of attempted carrying concealed weapons. Thus, defendant's offense of carrying concealed weapons was properly enhanced as a felony of the third degree.</SPAN></P>

Relator's petition for a writ in quo warranto was prompted by conflicting appointments by the common pleas court and the board of trustees to fill a single vacancy on the board of park commissioners. The common pleas court appointed defendant to the board of park commissioners for a three-year term. The township board of trustees appointed relator to a three-year term to fill the same position. At a meeting of the board of park commissioners, defendant was installed as a park commissioner, and despite demand by relator, she refused to relinquish the office. Relator sought a writ of quo warranto, which the court granted. Since the township was entirely contained within the unincorporated area of the township, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 511.18, the township board of trustees, which appointed relator, and not the common pleas court, which appointed defendant, held the power of appointment to the board of park commissioners.

On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 531.10 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, violating his freedom of speech. The court held that &sect; 531.10 was unconstitutional because the statute's language was not sufficiently definite so that ordinary people could have understood at what volume level the sound-amplification device contravened the ordinance. The acceptable range of volume was not definite or apparent from the language, creating a variable standard that was not related not to the alleged public interest to be served.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County (Ohio) in which he was convicted, by a three judge panel, of aggravated murder, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01, with a specification for kidnapping, as set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.01. After he was convicted of aggravating circumstances listed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.05(A)(5), defendant was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that a five year old victim was incompetent to testify. The court on appeal disagreed, as the record clearly indicated that the victim had the ability to observe, recall, and relate accurately the events. Finding that the photographic and line-up identification procedures were not impermissibly suggestive, the court held that, under the totality of the circumstances, the identifications were reliable. The court next held that a trier of fact could have reasonably found defendant guilty of the aggravated murder of the five year old's mother, and that he killed her while committing a kidnapping. The court found that the trial court complied with the requirement in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03(F) by stating that the aggravating circumstance of defendant's conviction for kidnapping outweighed the mitigating factors. The court applied the five factors of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.05 in reaching its holding that the death penalty was properly imposed. Defendant kidnapped the mother and bludgeoned her to death while her son watched; thus, the court held that the death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for the execution of the sentence. The court ordered that a special mandate be issued directing the trial court to carry the judgment into execution.

On appeal, the mother, who was involved in a lesbian relationship, contended that the trial court erred by awarding custody of the child on the basis of the mother's sexual preference. The trial court had stated that the lesbian affair was the major issue it considered in making its decision. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that although the trial court was required to consider the effect the mother's lesbian relationship had on the child as it related to his best interests, it was not required to find that the relationship had an adverse impact in order to award custody to the father. The court found that there were factors other than the mother's lesbian relationship that influenced the trial court's decision, including the mother's alcoholism, her absences from home, and the child's relationship with the father. The court held that as a result, the trial court's judgment was supported by the testimony and its discretion was not abused.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed suit against the hospital, alleging that the hospital and various doctors under its control were negligent in the diagnosis, treatment, and delivery of her son. The hospital filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The trial court granted the motion, and the mother appealed. The court held that the trial court properly dismissed the mother's complaint against the hospital because the hospital, as a county hospital, was immune from liability for any alleged negligence occurring before 1975 under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.02(B), and the child was born in 1968; thus, the county was immune from suit. The court further held that: (1) while the statute of limitations might authorize the bringing of the mother's action, the doctrine of sovereign immunity foreclosed recovery against the county; (2) the doctrine of sovereign immunity did not violate the child's equal protection rights; and (3) the doctrine of sovereign immunity did not violate the child's due process rights because no right existed to sue the state or its instrumentalities, including counties and their agencies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the executrix of her deceased husband's estate, appealed a decision from the Common Pleas Court, County of Summit, Ohio, which granted summary judgment to defendant, the decedent's employer, in the executrix's an intentional tort resulting in her husband's death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was part of a crew that installed a switch atop a power transmission line. Prior to installation, the power pole had an existing ground wire on it. The drawings relied upon by the crew showed that the pole was properly grounded, even though, in reality, it was not. When the employer authorized the crew to open the switch, the decedent was electrocuted. Although he had safety equipment available, the decedent chose not to wear them. The executrix sued the employer for an intentional tort resulting in her husband's death. On appeal from a summary judgment grant for the employer, the court held that the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the employer because there was no evidence that the employer knew that the pole was improperly grounded or had put the decedent in danger by sending him to work on the switch. Absent a decision by the employer to put the decedent in a position substantially certain to cause his injury, there was no intentional tort. The court also held that the trial court committed no prejudicial error in applying the wrong standard of intent when the standard it used was more demanding than necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The referee recommended that the mother be awarded custody because she could provide a more stimulating environment for the child's growth and development. The trial court adopted the recommendation and awarded custody to the mother. The court ruled that the father waived his contention that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.04, the Ohio joint custody statute, was unconstitutional because he did not raise the issue in the trial court. Further, even had he raised the issue and it had merit, the father was not prejudiced because he always asserted that he wanted sole, not joint, custody. The father argued that the trial court erred in concluding that the referee's findings were sufficient to enable the trial court to make an independent analysis and conclude that it was in the child's best interest for the mother to have sole custody. The court disagreed, finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in accepting the referee's recommendation because the referee provided the trial court with a detailed report on which to base its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A lumber company initiated the annexation process by contacting the adjoining city about its tax and trash hauling costs. Several other landowners appointed the company as their representative in the process. After the adjoining city received the request, it paid the company's legal expenses, hired an engineer to prepare a map for the annexation proceedings, hired a consultant to prepare a report regarding the property values of land in the proposed annexed area, circulated annexation petitioners, and distributed the cost for services for residents in the proposed area. The annexation law provided for two separate processes for annexation, one was for use when the application was made by a citizen, the other when made by a city. The county commission followed the citizen process. The court affirmed the trial court's judgments granting the annexation. The court held that even though the adjacent city provided substantial support to the annexation movement, the process followed was proper as Ohio Rev. Code ch. 709 did not prohibit such assistance. The court also held there was sufficient evidence to support the determination that annexation was good for the annexed landowners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer filed a subrogation claim against the city, for losses paid to its insured after his vehicle was struck behind by a city police officer's cruiser, in the insured's suit to recover the diminution in value of his vehicle. The trial court awarded damages to the insured against the city but dismissed his claim against the officer, then dismissed the insurer's subrogation claim against the officer and the city under &sect; 2744.05(B), which took effect on the day the accident occurred. On review, the court found that &sect; 2744.05(B) constitutionally precluded an insurer's subrogation rights in suits involving Ohio's political subdivisions, and that when &sect; 2744.05(B) abolished the collateral source rule, the basis for subrogation no longer existed. The court found that protection of the fiscal integrity of Ohio's political subdivisions was a legitimate government interest, that &sect; 2744.05(B) treated all insureds and insurers in the same manner as to claims against political subdivisions, and that the insurer's contractual subrogation right never rose to the level of a property right because &sect; 2744.05 took effect before any right of action accrued.</SPAN></P>

The bank alleged that it received a rejection letter from the attorney representing the executor based on the bank's failure to present its claim pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The court affirmed and held that it was undisputed that the bank did not commence an action on the rejected claim until after the two month limitations period of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2117.12. The bank had an opportunity to present its constitutional challenge to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2117 in the special statutory proceeding provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2117.12.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a construction foreman at a mine, was on the back of a piece of equipment, a mule, which tipped forward causing him to hit the mine roof and incur extensive injuries. The employee alleged that the mule was defective, that the operator was not competent to safely operate the equipment, and that no notices were posted of the dangerous and defective condition of the mule. The court found that the trial court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the subsidiary where the employee worked not for the subsidiary, but for the parent company. The court found that the trial court correctly concluded that the employee did not fall within the purview of the intentional tort statute because the employer had no knowledge that the employee would be using the mule where employees were prohibited from riding on it, and the protective canopy the employer contended should not have been removed was not designed to protect riders since it was never anticipated that there would be any. Furthermore, the employer did not direct the employer to use the mule as he did. The court noted that the employee was a foreman with safety responsibilities who violated safety standards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of two counts of aggravated murder while committing an aggravated robbery and an aggravated burglary, he appealed. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by permitting the State to argue improperly. Defendant's counsel, on appeal, cited several instances in which alleged prosecutorial misconduct occurred at trial. The court noted that in all of the instances, the trial court sustained defense counsel's objection thereto. Furthermore, the court found that, at the time of the objections, defense counsel did not request any further relief from the trial court. The court stated that the trial court granted all of the relief requested by defense counsel and that defendant could not complain, therefore, on appeal that the trial court acted improperly. The court determined that the trial court did not err in failing to sustain defendant's motion to make the State elect on which aggravated murder offense defendant was actually convicted of prior to a mitigation hearing. The court concluded that the State properly made its election at the time of sentencing and that defendant was sentenced on only one count of aggravated murder.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2107.39, to take against the will.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The spouse was ordered to make an election to take under or against her husband's will by August 15, 1987. On August 26, 1987, the spouse signed an election to take against the will and her election was filed on September 3, 1987. The trial court found that, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2107.41, the wife was conclusively presumed to have taken under the will because her election was untimely. The spouse contended that she did not receive appropriate notice of the citation. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court's judgment was supported by competent, credible evidence because there was nothing in the record to show that the spouse was unaware her opportunity to elect under or against the will. She was not prejudiced by the trial court's failure to serve her notice by certified mail because her counsel's appearance in applying for several extensions of time constituted notice to her. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2107.43, requiring her to personally appear to make an election to take against the will, did not violation the Equal Protection Clause because it was rationally related to the government's purpose of protecting the interest of surviving spouses and decedents.</SPAN></P>

The neighbor tried to bar defendant from entering his home but failed to do so. Defendant filed a plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. A hearing determined defendant was competent to stand trial. Defendant contended that the trial court erred by overruling his motion to dismiss the charge for exceeding the statutory 270 day speedy trial time period mandated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71(C)(2). On appeal, the court determined that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.72(B) tolled the statutory period for any time when defendant was mentally incompetent or when his mental competency was being determined. In addition, the time between defendant's plea of not guilty by reason of insanity and a finding of his mental competency to stand trial directly resulting from such plea was not included in computing days under Ohio Rev.

On appeal, the court reversed. Although the legislature intended for &sect; 4123.411(C) to apply retroactively, the amended version as applied to injuries before its effective date with respect to self-insured employers was unconstitutionally retroactive. The language &quot;regardless of the date of injury&quot; in &sect; 4123.411(C) indicated the legislature's intent that the statute be applied retroactively. But Ohio Const. art. II. &sect; 28 barred retroactive application of laws affecting substantive rights, and the change in DWRF assessments affected the self-insured employers' substantive rights by imposing a new burden for a past occurrence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought dismissal of the resisting arrest charges against them. The trial court overruled the motion and defendants appealed, following their convictions for the charged offenses. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the arrest warrant against the wife was issued when she failed to attend a hearing scheduled due to her failure to pay court costs arising from the dismissal of a traffic citation. The court held that, because the money she owed to the municipal court was not a fine, it had no statutory authority to hold a hearing under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2947.14, and had no jurisdiction to punish her for failing to attend the hearing. Therefore, the arrest warrant was unlawful, her arrest itself was unlawful, and the city could not prove all the elements of the resisting arrest charge against her. Further, the charge against husband for resisting the wife's arrest was also defective, and the municipal court should have dismissed the charges. However, the husband's convictions for assault and resisting his own arrest were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a bench trial, defendant was found guilty of operating an overweight vehicle on local streets.

Although his vehicle weighed about eight tons and the traffic sign prohibited &quot;thru vehicles&quot; over three and on-half tons empty weight, the court found that he was not operating a &quot;through vehicle&quot; because he was driving to his home in the local area. Because the phrase &quot;thru vehicles&quot; was not defined in Brook Park, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 301 et seq., the court interpreted the term according to its plain meaning and held that it meant &quot;initiated at and destined for&quot; points outside a local zone. The court ruled that the traffic sign did not pertain to defendant's vehicle because he had a local destination and the sign was insufficient to advise him that the city prohibited all overweight vehicles on residential streets.

On the day of trial, defendant moved for a continuance until conclusion of the Bureau's hearing and moved for dismissal of the charge. The trial court overruled both motions. Defendant pled no contest and was convicted of driving under suspension. He appealed, arguing that &sect; 4509.101 was unconstitutional. The court stated that the constitutionality of a statute as it related to a criminal prosecution was to be raised at the trial court in order to preserve it as an issue for appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient, an 82-year-old woman, appealed a judgment of the Ohio Court of Claims in favor of defendant hospital in the patient's personal injury action against the hospital for negligence. Plaintiff sought treatment at the hospital complaining of aching knees and was placed on a stretcher in an examining room. However, a nurse later found her lying on the floor in pain, having broken her hip.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiff claimed that the hospital was negligent, but the trial court found for the hospital, and the court affirmed, largely because the patient's arguments were handicapped by her failure to provide a the court with trial transcript, and some of the exhibits she did provide could not be considered on appeal unless they were included within the transcript of proceedings. Thus, the court overruled the patient's objection that the hospital failed to follow its own safety standards for patients with mobility problems by negligently failing to put the side-rails up on her stretcher. The statement of policy alone did not establish the hospital's negligence, and the patient provided no other evidence of negligence. Further, the policy was only issued after the patient's accident, and it may have allowed the staff to use discretion with alert and ambulatory patients, which the patient was. There was also no support for the claim that the lack of side-rails was the proximate cause of the patient's injury, as she cited no evidence that they would have been an effective restraint in her case. It was unclear whether she fell off or whether she fell down after climbing off the stretcher.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for the hospital.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the convictions, the court rejected appellant's pretrial misjoinder claim as well as his guilt/innocence phase claims that unduly prejudicial prior bad acts evidence was introduce, that prosecutorial misconduct occurred, that the evidence was insufficient, and that the three-judge panel used the wrong standard and considered irrelevant material. In upholding the death sentence, the court rejected appellant's penalty phase claims of ineffective counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, improper admission of inflammatory evidence, and improper reliance on nonstatutory and duplicative aggravating factors. The noncapital punishments were set aside on procedural grounds. Finally, the court held that appellant's death sentence was neither excessive nor comparatively disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State challenged a judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which held in favor of defendant landlords and tenants on the State's suit for injunctions under Ohio's nuisance statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.03. The State sought to bar the landlords and tenants of the premises involved from distributing certain alleged obscene magazines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought injunctions to bar the landlords and tenants from distributing certain alleged obscene magazines. The trial court held that the dissemination of obscene magazines did not constitute a nuisance as defined by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.01(C) and that the material was not obscene. The court reversed and held that the State was entitled to the injunctions. The State had a cause of action under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.03 to bring the nuisance actions because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.37(B), which stated that premises used for repeated violations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2907.31 or .32 constituted a nuisance subject to abatement, required proof of violations not prior criminal convictions. Utilizing the Miller test for obscenity and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.01(F), the court held that the magazines, at least some of which depicted vaginal, oral, or anal intercourse, with penetration clearly visible, lacked serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. The court held that the magazines were obscene because the average person in the community would have viewed the magazines as appealing to the prurient interest in a patently offensive manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and held that the State was entitled to injunctions against the landlords and tenants to enjoin them from maintaining the nuisance proven.

The insurance company for the car driver paid its insured for her loss pursuant to its policy of collision insurance. The insurer then filed suit against the school bus driver and the Board of Education. The trial court dismissed the suit on the basis of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.05(B), which clearly precluded the insurer's subrogated claim. Section 2744.05(B) provided that if a claimant received benefits for injuries allegedly incurred from a policy or policies of insurance or any other source, the benefits were to be disclosed to the trial court, and the amount of the benefits was to be deducted from any award against a political subdivision recovered by the claimant. Section 2744.05(B) further stated that no insurer or other person was entitled to bring an action under a subrogation provision in an insurance or other contract against a political subdivision with respect to such benefits. The insurer argued on appeal that &sect; 2744.05(B) was violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.

Specifically, defendant asserted that the phrases &quot;torture or cruelly abuse&quot; and &quot;cruel manner&quot; as used in &sect; 2919.22(B), were unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court found that the phrases were such that a person of ordinary sensibilities and intelligence should have been capable of ascertaining their meaning and abiding by the proscriptions of the statute. Thus, Ohio Rev. Code Ann.&sect; 2919.22(B)(2) and (3) were not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Further, the court noted that the test to determine the sufficiency of the evidence was whether reasonable minds could reach different conclusions on the question of whether each element of an offense had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A post office postmistress was discovered in a field two counties away. The autopsy indicated that she had been stabbed at least 15 times. The jury found defendant guilty of kidnapping and aggravated murder. The jury's death penalty recommendation was accepted by the trial court. Defendant was not successful on appeal. The court rejected defendant's 65 assignments of error. The court rejected the contention that defendant was prejudiced by the state's failure to disclose defendant's brief oral confession to a postal inspector because he simply neglected to record the confession in his notes, the state had no notice of it, the defense counsel elicited the testimony, and other witnesses testified that defendant confessed to them. Most of the prosecutorial misconduct about which defendant complained took place during closing argument, during which some latitude and freedom of expression were permitted, and the comments did not result in an unfair verdict.

Defendant asserted that his common law spouse, who was also a witness for the state, was an accomplice, so the trial court was required to instruct the jury in accordance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.03(D). On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that as the evidence failed to indicate that defendant's wife was an accomplice and, because she was not charged as one, the jury instruction was not required. The crimes that defendant was charged with were not allied offenses of similar import because his conduct consisted of two separate and distinct actions. Thus, he could be convicted of both. The testimony indicated that defendant disciplined an eight week old infant on other occasions and totally contradicted his defense that an accident caused the baby's injuries. Thus, the trial court properly admitted it. The trial court had discretion to allow the testimony to be read to the jury during their deliberations and it was properly conducted in the presence of all parties without objection by defendant.

The trial court held that the tuition payments constituted a &quot;gift&quot; pursuant to Ohio Rev.

On appeal, the court held that &sect; 2301.36(A) did not create a conclusive presumption in violation of federal and state due process rights because it gave a payor spouse a sufficient opportunity to rebut the presumption that support payments not made through the bureau of support were gifts.The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to credit the tuition payments against the arrearages because the parties could not unilaterally change the divorce decree and attendance at parochial schools was not necessary for the children's support.</SPAN></P>

The other two officers were killed and defendant, who was driving, was unharmed. A fireman on the scene took defendant to the firehouse, evading police. Defendant's blood was not drawn until eight hours after the accident, at which time it was determined that he had a blood alcohol content of .002 percent. At trial, the lab technician who performed the test testified as to the results. The court held that the results of the blood alcohol test were inadmissible pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.06 because there was no proper foundation laid in the absence of expert testimony explaining the test results. However, there was substantial circumstantial evidence presented which supported a finding that defendant was the driver of the vehicle, that he was operating it in a criminally reckless manner which proximately resulted in two deaths, and that he was driving under the influence.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the judgment, the court found that defendant's contention that &sect; 2905.05 was void for vagueness, overbroad, and unconstitutional as to him was feckless. The statute provided reasonable notice of the conduct it prohibited, and the type of conduct in which defendant was engaged was precisely the type of conduct that the statute was designed to punish. Further, there was no merit to defendant's contention that the trial court erred in denying his motion for acquittal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from a summary judgment granted by the trial court in favor of the Board in a declaratory judgment action. The judgment was premised on the court's finding that plaintiffs lacked standing to maintain the action. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Plaintiffs argued that, absent declaratory relief, they risked criminal or civil liability were they to heed the director's determination that Ohio pharmacists might legally fill prescriptions written by out-of-state practitioners. The court held that if the members violated Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2925.02, Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2925.03 or Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2925.23, such conduct was contrary to plaintiffs' position regarding the validity of the statutes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant requested court-appointed counsel after he was charged with allowing his motor vehicle to be operated by an unlicensed driver, a violation of Galion, Ohio, Ordinance 335.05. The Judge appointed counsel for the defendant and informed him that he would be required to work 40 hours in an alternative service program to help defray the costs. The defendant then sought a writ of prohibition against the Judge. In that regard, a recent decision issued by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire found that a proposed statute requiring an indigent defendant to perform uncompensated work in order to repay the government for his court-appointed counsel was unconstitutional in that it conditioned a defendant's enjoyment of his Thirteenth Amendment rights on his relinquishment of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and vice-versa. The court found that reasoning also applied to the defendant's participation in an alternative service program. Therefore, the court issued a writ of prohibition because a contempt or habeas corpus proceeding would not offer an adequate remedy to the defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the employer as a rental agent at an apartment complex. After she was assaulted by a potential tenant, the employee and her husband filed an intentional tort action against the employer, who owned the apartment, and the managing agent. The employer moved for summary judgment, on the ground that the employee and husband were not entitled to judgment because &sect; 4121.80, if applied retroactively, created a workers' compensation claim to remedy intentional torts by employers. The employer argued that even if &sect; 4121.80 was not applied retroactively, the claim was precluded the employee's workers' compensation recovery. The trial court applied &sect; 4121.80 and granted the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed. It noted that retroactive application of &sect; 4121.80 was improper because it was a substantive revision of existing law. Furthermore, the claim was filed within the two-year statute of limitations in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.10. However, summary judgment was proper because reasonable minds could not conclude that harm to the employee was a substantial certainty, rather than a high risk, within the meaning of relevant case law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The abortion clinic sought a restraining order against defendant pro-life organizations as well as the members. The trial court dismissed the pro-life organizations from the action, finding that the pro-life organizations themselves did not participate in any of the picketing activities. However, the trial court certified a class of all would-be picketers as defendants and issued the restraining order against the class. On appeal, the court held: (1) the trial court abused its discretion in certifying a class action because the class as defined was too ambiguous and amorphous, the defenses of the representative parties were not typical of the defenses of the class, and the representative parties could not have fairly and adequately protected the interests of the class; and (3) the would-be picketers were bound by the injunction and could have been held in contempt if their conduct was such as to aid or abet the members in violating the injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record revealed that defendant made three telephone calls to three former school acquaintances in the early hours of one morning. Defendant identified himself as a police officer who was investigating a young woman who had been arrested for soliciting. Two of the calls were received by parents who were told that the woman was their daughter. The court rejected that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.21(A)(1) was unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. The statute prohibited a person from making a telephone call without identifying himself with the purpose to harass, abuse, or annoy another. It proscribed the making of a telephone call with the requisite intent and in the specified manner. The court found that the statute's prohibitions were clearly defined and provided fair notice of the conduct that was proscribed. Additionally, the statute focused on the caller, rather than on the content of the speech. The intent with which the call was made established the criminality of the conduct. The court held that the State had a legitimate interest in prohibiting obscene, threatening, and harassing phone calls, none of which were generally thought of as protected by the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tract owners conveyed by warranty deed all of the coal, oil, gas, and other minerals in and under two tracts of land to the tax seller. The tax seller failed to pay taxes on a tract, and the tract was sold to a tax purchaser through a tax sale. The tax purchaser's deed recited that he received all of the coal, oil, gas and other minerals under the tract. The tax purchaser quit claimed his estate to appellee. The tax seller also purported to convey the same mineral estate to an individual who, in turn, conveyed the tract to appellants. Both appellee and appellants purported to lease the mineral estate rights to the lessee. Appellee brought an action to quiet title to the mineral estate, and the common pleas court ruled for appellee. Affirming, the court held that the tax sale did not just transfer title to the coal. The fact that the words &quot;coal only&quot; appeared on the auditor's tax cards meant that only the coal had any value at the time, but all of the minerals were included. A sale for tax delinquency sold all of the interest held regardless of the auditor's opinion of tax value.

Code Ann. &sect; 2744.05. The claimant objected to the recommendation by raising a distinct possibility that her insurance rates would increase upon the insurer's payment of her claim. On appeal of the municipal court's adoption of the referee's recommendation, the court affirmed the claimant's $ 250 judgment by holding that, in the absence of a verifiable injury from an actual increase in her automobile insurance rate, the claimant had no standing to attack the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.05(B), which eliminated the collateral source rule in all actions against political subdivisions. Further, as the classification in &sect; 2744.05(B) did not prevent any class of persons from bringing an action against a political subdivision, but merely reduced the amount of damages insured claimants could recover, the classification was not constitutionally suspect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of Cincinnati appealed from a judgment of the Hamilton County Municipal Court, which granted defendant's motion to dismiss a citation charging him with operating a semi-trailer at speeds in excess of 55 miles per hour, in violation of Cincinnati, Ohio, Municipal Code &sect; 506-67.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was cited for operating a semi-trailer at an excessive speed in violation of Cincinnati, Ohio, Municipal Code &sect; 506-67. He argued below that &sect; 506-67 violated the Equal Protection Clause by singling out semi-trailers for discrimination. The trial court found the ordinance unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. The pivotal issue on appeal was whether the trial court erred in holding that &sect; 506-67 violated equal protection. Defendant failed to submit a responsive brief or to appear at the hearing on the merits. Accepting as correct the facts and one of the issues advanced by the City, the court found that the City's brief reasonably appeared to warrant reversal. Section 506-67 bore a real and substantial relationship to a proper subject of municipal police power under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3, and defendant failed to overcome a strong presumption in favor of its constitutionality. He had presented no evidence to the trial court and thus failed to sustain his burden of producing clear and convincing evidence that the ordinance lacked a real and substantial relationship to the City's legitimate regulation of semi-trailer traffic, in the interest of public safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners application for a zoning certificate for a home they wished to build was denied because the residence and accessory building exceeded the height restrictions set forth in Hudson Township, Ohio, Zoning Resolution art. VIII, &sect; 8.5 and Hudson Township, Ohio, Zoning Resolution art. V, &sect; 5.5. The zoning board of appeals granted a variance for the accessory building, but denied the request for the residence. The landowners sought an acceptance arguing the tower on the residence was a cupola. The zoning board reiterated its decision. The landowners modified their plans and a certificate was granted. The landowners began construction adhering to the original plans. A stop work order was issued. The zoning board denied a request for the same variance. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) where the landowners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies as to the zoning board's original decision that the tower was not a cupola, it was not properly before the trial court or the court; (2) the landowners failed to overcome the presumptive validity of the Resolutions; (3) the Resolutions were constitutional; and (4) the statutory conditions existed for granting an injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in sentencing her to an indefinite term of imprisonment because: (1) she was convicted of a fourth degree felony, which was not an offense of violence under Ohio Rev.

In affirming defendant's sentence, the court found that it was of no consequence that the offense was not included as an offense of violence under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.01(1). The statute did not provide an exclusive listing of offenses. The trial court could impose an indefinite term because a violence specification was included in the indictment and defendant was found to have caused physical harm to the victim. Ohio Rev.

On his pro se appeal, defendant raised eight assignments of error. The appellate court rejected these claimed errors, holding, inter alia, (1) that the prosecution complied with defendant's discovery request concerning the records of prior administrative hearings, (2) that the trial court properly sustained the prosecution's motion in limine to prevent defendant from challenging as unlawful the notice of violation and order of compliance and from asserting that he did not intend to violate the notice and order or did not know the law, (3) that the trial court did not err in citing defendant for contempt or in sentencing defendant, and (4) that defendant was not prejudiced by the prosecutor's improper remarks.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of the judgment from the court of common pleas (Ohio), which reduced appellee city employee's period of suspension, awarded him back pay, compensatory damages for breach of contract, and attorney fees under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12. The city alleged that the trial court had no jurisdiction because Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, who worked under a labor contract with the city, was discharged for insubordination and neglect of duty. The employee appealed to the civil service commission, which modified the discharge to a suspension without pay. The employee filed an action in the trial court in which he appealed from the commission's order and alleged breach of contract. The city appealed the trial court's judgment, alleging that the trial court had no jurisdiction over the breach-of-contract claim because the labor contract called for arbitration. On appeal, the court held that the employee had no claim for breach of contract. The labor contract did not fall within the provisions of &sect; 4117.10(A) because the city had expressly reserved the right to suspend or discharge employees for just cause. Thus, the commission had jurisdiction and was not bound by the labor contract. However, the trial court had no jurisdiction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12 to try the case de novo or to award the employee back pay. Furthermore, the trial court had no right to award attorney fees under &sect; 119.12 because &sect; 119.12 did not apply to hearings conducted prior to the statute's effective date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and dismissed the employee's claim for breach of contract and compensatory and punitive damages and attorney fees.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Ross County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which entered a judgment of conviction against defendant after a jury found him guilty of theft, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02, and for disrupting public services, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.04.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of cutting a railroad's radio communication wires. After a jury convicted defendant of theft and disrupting public services, he appealed. On appeal, he claimed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.04 was vague because it failed to define &quot;public transportation.&quot; Defendant further claimed that the trial court should have instructed the jury on the lesser-included offenses of attempt to commit theft and attempt to disrupt public services. He claimed that the wire never left the railroad's property and there was proof that the cutting of the wires actually prevented a train from running. On review, the court held that the term &quot;public transportation&quot; was defined by its ordinary meaning. The court concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02 did not require evidence that the property left the owner's premises. The statute merely required evidence that the criminal &quot;obtained or exerted control&quot; over the property. Further, contrary to defendant's argument, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.04 did not require evidence that the public transportation was actually interrupted. Evidence that the public transportation was impaired satisfied the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, with others, sat in a jeep outside the home of the high school principal, honked the horn, and yelled obscenities. One man exposed his buttocks. The principal was at home with his wife and two teen-aged daughters and all witnessed the incident. Defendant claimed, and the trial court found, that he exposed his buttocks but did not yell any of the obscenities. His conviction as an unruly child was proper. In so ruling, the court stated that, viewed in the light of the specific facts of the case, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Although &quot;mooning&quot; in some circumstances might be considered foolish but innocuous, under the specific facts of the case it was calculated to convey the same message of harassment as the obscenities. Further, inasmuch as defendant's conduct could arguably fall within the crime of public indecency, his conduct was proscribed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.022(C). Further, by use of the term &quot;endanger,&quot; the statute proscribed not only behavior that actually caused harm but also behavior that could be harmful.</SPAN></P>

The jury found defendant guilty of all charges and recommended the death sentence. The Ross County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) followed the jury's recommendation and sentenced defendant to death on the aggravated murder conviction and to 10 to 25 years in prison on the aggravated burglary conviction. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was murdered during a burglary. The grand jury indicted defendant for aggravated burglary and for aggravated murder with a death specification that the aggravated murder was done for the purpose of escaping detection and with a second death specification that the murder was done during the course of an aggravated burglary. Defendant was found guilty as charged. Defendant challenged his convictions and sentences, including a death sentence imposed upon the aggravated murder conviction. Rejecting each and every one of defendant's 29 assignments of error, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. Upon independent review pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.05(A), the court held that the aggravating specifications outweighed the mitigating factors that were admissible under &sect; 2929.04(B)(3)-(5), (6)-(7), including defendant's heavy intoxication by drugs or alcohol or both at the time of the offense, his &quot;youth&quot; of 23 years of age at the time of the offense, and the lack of significant history of prior criminal convictions. Nor did the court find that the death sentence was excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's death sentence that was imposed upon his conviction for aggravated murder.

The court held that the trustees were required to show a legal right or interest in the property sought to be annexed, and they failed to do so. The adjoining landowners failed to show that their interests would be adversely affected, and the finding that the general good of the territory would be served by annexation was not error. Further, the trial court properly determined that the area sought to be annexed was not unreasonably large. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to award costs and attorney's fees because the trustees did not engage in frivolous conduct in the filing of their action.</SPAN></P>

The property owners filed a petition to annex their land from the township to the city, and the request for annexation was granted over the objection of the township trustees. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment upholding the order for the owners. The court held that there was no evidence showing that the township's tax base would be significantly affected by the annexation, and the finding that the territory to be annexed was not unreasonably large was not erroneous. While township residents expressed their disapproval of the annexation, this evidence was not relevant to the question of whether the annexation would serve the general good of the territory. The trustees were notified of the date and time of the hearing after the annexation petition was filed, and the fact that the notice was sent out before the actual resolution by the commissioners was a technicality that created no harm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fayette County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) convicted defendant of trafficking in drugs and marijuana. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for trafficking in drugs for selling one valium tablet to an undercover agent (count one) and for trafficking in marijuana for selling three tenths of a gram of marijuana to the same agent (count two). A jury found defendant guilty as charged. Subsequent to the trial and sentencing, the trial court discovered that count two of the indictment was a minor misdemeanor offense rather than a felony offense. On appeal, the court found that defendant simply gave marijuana to the agent when the agent was persistent in his request for such. The court held that defendant proved the defense of entrapment and that the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict. The court also held that defendant was not entitled to a special instruction on mistake of fact simply because he was not aware of the full range of conduct prohibited by the trafficking statutes. The court determined the presentation of evidence and arguments that the gift of marijuana was similar to the &quot;sale&quot; of a valium tablet constituted prejudicial error to defendant. The court sustained defendant's assignments of error in part and overruled them in part.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded defendant's conviction for trafficking in drugs and discharged his conviction of trafficking in marijuana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an insured and her insurer, appealed the judgment of the trial court (Ohio), which sustained defendant city's motion to dismiss the insurer's claim in plaintiffs' action against the city to recover damages to the insured's automobile allegedly caused by a defective manhole in a city street.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss based upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(1), and for failure to state a claim pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6). Plaintiffs argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.05(B) was unconstitutional in violation of the Equal Protection Clauses of the Ohio Constitution and the United States Constitution. On appeal, the court affirmed. It held that the classification of the insurer bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose and, therefore, &sect; 2744.05(B) was presumed valid. The court concluded that the statutory classification was not barred by the Equal Protection Clauses. The court ruled that such bar existed only if the statutory classification manifested a patently arbitrary classification, utterly lacking in rational justification. The court found that &sect; 2744.05(B) merely re-imposed the doctrine of governmental immunity to the extent that an injured party had a collateral source by way of insurance. Because &sect; 2744(B) had not involved either fundamental rights or suspect classifications, a general rule of minimum level of judicial scrutiny applied to equal protection claims.</SPAN></P>
