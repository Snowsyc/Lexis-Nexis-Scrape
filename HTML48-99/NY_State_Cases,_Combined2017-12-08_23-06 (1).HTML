<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner director of state developmental center commenced a proceeding to challenge a do not resuscitate order for a mentally retarded individual issued by a physician after consultation with his sister, who was his legal guardian. Petitioner claimed that the order was improperly written under N.Y. Pub. Health Law art. 29-B.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner director of state developmental center challenged a do not resuscitate order (DNR) that was written under N.Y. Pub. Health Law art. 29-B (DNR statutes) by a mentally retarded patient's physician after consultation with the patient's legal guardian. The court granted the petition and struck down N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2965(3)(c)(iv). The court held that: (1) there was no evidence before the court demonstrating to a reasonable medical certainty that the patient's present medical condition would make cardiopulmonary resuscitation a medical futile treatment; (2) the right to decline treatment could not be exercised by a third-party; (3) the DNR statutes did not define the term &quot;extraordinary burden,&quot; and, thus, that part of the DNR statutes was unconstitutionally uncertain and vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petitioner director of state developmental center's request to strike down a do not resuscitate order written by a physician for a mentally retarded individual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health - &quot;Do Not Resuscitate&quot; Orders - Controversy Ripe for Judicial Review A proceeding commenced by a developmental center pursuant to Public Health Law article 29-B challenging a &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; order obtained by the guardian of a mentally disabled adult who resides in the center is not prematurely commenced even though the parties have not participated in any dispute mediation system as contemplated by the relevant statute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Health Law &sect; 2972).  The statute clearly provides that the Department of Health or a duly authorized agency may commence an action or proceeding to enjoin a violation of this article.  The Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities and, by extension, the center, has the responsibility for ensuring that the personal and civil rights of persons receiving care and treatment are adequately protected (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 13.07 [c]).  The person here is such a person and the instant proceeding is properly before the court.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health - &quot;Do Not Resuscitate&quot; Orders - Securing Order on Behalf of Mentally Incapacitated Adult - Determination of Decision-Making Abilities A physician's determination that an adult incapacitated patient in a facility lacks decision-making abilities must be made with a reasonable degree of medical certainty, must be in writing and must contain the physician's opinion regarding the cause and nature of the patient's incapacity as well as its extent and probable duration (Public Health Law &sect; 2963 [2]).  Thus, where the guardian of a mentally disabled adult obtained a &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; (DNR) order from the patient's physician, and no capacity determination was made before writing the DNR order and the written report made after the examination did not address capacity, the Public Health Law was violated even though no dispute exists that the person is profoundly retarded. The capacity determination must be made in each case because the statute presumes all persons have capacity notwithstanding that a guardian has previously been appointed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health - &quot;Do Not Resuscitate&quot; Orders - Surrogate Order - Determination of Medically Futile Treatment The &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; (DNR) order obtained by the guardian of a mentally incapacitated adult residing in a developmental center, which was not supported by a finding that the patient's current medical condition would make resuscitation a medically futile treatment was, in effect, a &quot;living will&quot;, to become effective prospectively in the event of an illness severe enough to cause respiratory and cardiac arrest and, thus, was a violation of Public Health Law &sect; 2965 (3) (c) which requires a surrogate DNR order to be supported by the current medical condition of the patient. &quot;Medically futile&quot; means that resuscitation would be unsuccessful in restoring cardiac and respiratory function or that the patient will experience repeated arrests in a short period of time before death occurs (Public Health Law &sect; 2961 [12]).  Here no evidence was presented that the patient's present medical condition would make resuscitation a medically futile treatment.  Although he has chronic illnesses, the patient is not acutely ill and his illnesses are not life-threatening. Further, living wills cannot be imputed to those who are incompetent to make them.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Surrogate &quot;Do Not Resuscitate&quot; Orders - Vagueness of &quot;Extraordinary Burden&quot; Element The &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; order obtained, pursuant to Public Health Law article 29-B, by the guardian of a mentally incapacitated adult residing in a developmental center, based upon the physicians' opinion that resuscitation would place an &quot;extraordinary burden&quot; on the patient is rescinded since the &quot;extraordinary burden&quot; section (Public Health Law &sect; 2965 [3] [c] [iv]) fails to pass constitutional muster.  The Public Health Law does not define &quot;extraordinary burden&quot; and the term, subject to numerous meanings, is uncertain and vague. Although his life as a developmentally disabled person may seem a small possession from the perspective of some, it remains his possession and no person or court should substitute its judgment as to what would be an acceptable quality of life for another.  The &quot;extraordinary burden&quot; provision opens the door to the treatment of the mentally and developmentally disabled as second-class citizens and any perceived possible diminution in their &quot;quality of life&quot; could be a basis for the denial of life-saving treatment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. The matter came before the court for a hearing on defendant's motion for an order suppressing physical evidence and several statements allegedly made to a law enforcement official.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to suppress physical evidence, namely a semiautomatic pistol, and several statements allegedly made to a law enforcement official. The court granted the motion to suppress in all respects. It made the factual determination that the stop of defendant's van was a so-called &quot;pretext stop&quot; and thus insufficient in law to serve as a predicate for the seizure of the gun. The court reasoned that the police officers admitted that they were following defendant and subsequently stopped the van because they believed he was carrying a gun. It observed that their belief was based upon their trained observations and experience, although not sufficient to establish the basis necessary for a lawful stop. The court stated that it was obliged to suppress the gun and the ensuing statements as fruits of a poisoned tree.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Unlawful Search and Seizure - Illegal Pretext Stop of Vehicle The gun seized from defendant is suppressed where the police officers observed him in an area known for previous drug and weapon possession arrests, observed him adjust his waistband, but did not see an actual object or bulge in his waistband, observed him enter the passenger side of a van, and followed and stopped the van when the driver turned without signaling, since the stop of the van was a &quot;pretext stop&quot; which violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  The police may not use traffic infractions to justify a stop of an individual when the police action is motivated by other reasons, namely, some suspicion that falls short of a reasonable suspicion that an occupant of a vehicle has committed, is in the process of or is about to commit a crime. Here, the police officers admitted that they stopped the van not because of the traffic infraction but because they believed the defendant was carrying a gun. Their belief was based upon their trained observations and experience, but these factors are insufficient to establish the basis necessary for a lawful stop.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment charging him with aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the first degree, in violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 511(3), alleging ex post facto and double jeopardy violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 511(3), which made it a class E felony to drive a vehicle with 10 or more license suspensions in effect, presented ex post facto problems because it imposed additional penalty for earlier crimes. Defendant also argued that he had already pleaded guilty to the crime in question, so that he could not be indicted again. The court found that the statute did not present ex post facto problems: the statute imposed a stiffer penalty for the current crime because it was repeated, rather than adding penalties for previous crimes, and, once the law was enacted, defendant had notice that continuing to drive with numerous license suspensions would result in stiff penalties. The court found that defendant had not pleaded guilty to the current crime because the crime resulting in the guilty plea and the current crime had different docket numbers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss, holding that the statute in question was a recidivist law, which created a stiffer penalty for the offense because it was a repeated one rather than imposing additional penalty, or putting defendant in jeopardy again, for earlier crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motor Vehicles - Aggravated Unlicensed Operation of Motor Vehicle - Utilizing Suspensions That Occurred Prior to Effective Date of Statute - No Ex Post Facto Law Defendant may be charged with a violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 511 (3) for operating a motor vehicle while he had in effect 10 or more suspensions, imposed on at least 10 separate dates for failure to answer, appear or pay a fine on a summons issued for a traffic violation, even though some of the suspensions occurred prior to the effective date of the statute, since section 511 permits utilization of suspensions occurring prior to the effective date to create the necessary predicate, and utilization of these suspensions does not make section 511 (3) an unconstitutional ex post facto law. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 511 (3) is a recidivist statute, not unlike the laws which enhance punishment for predicate felons.  The punishment to be imposed would not be punishment for earlier license suspensions but only a stiffened penalty for the present crime because it is a repetitive one.  Moreover, defendant was given fair warning by the amendment to section 511 that his continued operation of a motor vehicle while his license suspensions were in effect would be regarded as felonious conduct. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motor Vehicles - Former Jeopardy - Prosecution of Two Separate Traffic Violations The People did not subject defendant to double jeopardy when they prosecuted him for violating Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 511 (3) after he pleaded guilty to driving with tinted windows, and paid a fine, since the fine receipt indicates a docket number different than the docket number for the section 511 violation and, thus, these cases are separate.  More importantly, defendant failed to produce any documentation, i.e., plea minutes, showing that his guilty plea to the tinted windows charge was meant to satisfy the section 511 charge.  Hence, defendant's claim that prosecution on the section 511 charge constitutes double jeopardy is without support in the record.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer filed a motion for partial summary judgment in its action against defendant City of Albany seeking a declaration that the city's transient sales tax it collected under Albany, N.Y. Code &sect; 7-240 violated the Commerce Clause, and U.S. Const. Art. I, &sect; 8. The taxpayer also sought attorney' fees and damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 1988. The company had paid the city's transient sales tax under protest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sold consumer products. Its retail sales occurred primarily at prescheduled sales throughout the state. The taxpayer collected sales tax on and filed sales tax returns for its sales within the state. The taxpayer was required to obtain a transient retail business license and pay a transient sales tax for a sale in the city. The court in denying the taxpayer's motion, held that because the Albany, N.Y. Code &sect; 7-240 did not differentiate based on where a retailer's business was located, exempted those merchants who conducted permanent retail business in the city, and taxed the gross receipts of all transient retail merchants, both from in state and out of state, the ordinance was not per se unconstitutional. It further found that the ordinance was not unconstitutional because even though the ordinance had an indirect incidental effect on interstate commerce, the ordinance served a legitimate purpose of producing revenue and the taxpayer did not pay more than its fair share. The court ruled that because the taxpayer failed to show that a federally protected right was violated, it failed to state a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and was not entitled to attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Commerce Clause - Validity of Municipal Ordinance That Taxes Transient Retailers A city ordinance requiring plaintiff foreign corporation and transient retailer to pay a retail business tax based on the gross amount of sales at the same rate as other property is taxed is not per se unconstitutional.  The States and their political subdivisions are prohibited from discriminating against interstate trade in that they may not tax a transaction more heavily when it crosses State lines than when it occurs entirely within the State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US Const, art I, &sect; 8, cl [3]).  Here, the tax is not imposed based on the in-or out-of-State origin of the merchandise sold by transient retailers or the location of the transient retailer in or out of this State.  This tax differentiates between retailers based upon whether they intend to conduct retail sales on a permanent or temporary basis in the city and without regard to any interstate element.  Thus, the differential tax treatment here does not result solely from the sites of their activities in or out of State, and does not provide a direct commercial advantage to in-State retailers. Further, the ordinance does not impose the type of simple economic protectionism of in-State business for which a virtually per se rule of invalidity has been erected.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Commerce Clause - Validity of Municipal Ordinance That Taxes Transient Retailers A city ordinance requiring plaintiff foreign corporation and transient retailer to pay a retail business tax based on the gross amount of sales at the same rate as other property is taxed does not violate the Commerce Clause </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US Const, art I, &sect; 8, cl [3]).  The ordinance may have some indirect incidental effect on interstate commerce in that a portion of transient retailers who are subject to the gross receipts tax do business or are based in other States and cross State lines to conduct retail sales in the city.  Nevertheless, the ordinance taxes all transient businesses evenly, regardless of whether their permanent home is in or out of State, based upon the reasonable distinction between retail merchants with permanent businesses in the city who pay property taxes and transient retailers who do not (and instead pay taxes at the same rate as property is taxed in the city).  The ordinance serves the legitimate municipal public purpose of producing revenues by requiring transient retailers to pay their fair share of municipal costs already paid by permanent retailers in the city.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights - Federal Civil Rights Claim - Counsel Fees Where a city ordinance mandating that transient retailers pay a sales tax based upon gross receipts is upheld as constitutional against plaintiff transient retailer's challenge and, thus, plaintiff was not deprived of any rights under 42 USC &sect; 1983, plaintiff is not entitled to attorney's fees and costs under 42 USC &sect; 1988. To state a claim under section 1983, plaintiff must allege, at a minimum, conduct by a person acting under color of law which deprived it of a right, privilege or immunity guaranteed by the Federal Constitution or the Federal laws.  Plaintiff did not satisfy that burden, since no Federally protected right was violated.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff church filed a motion for summary judgment in its declaratory judgment action brought against board of education of a school district (district), which enacted a policy under which it would no longer provide, rent, or lease transportation for pupils between the public school site and the church's released-time religious education program site.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole reason the district no longer leased its buses to the church was because it believed it lacked authority to lease buses for an entirely religious undertaking. The school argued that it was a specified entity under the plain language of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 1501-b(1)(h), to which the district could lease buses. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the church. The programs to which the students were transported were educational and the leasing of buses to the church did not advance any religious purpose. Neither taxpayer money nor taxpayer property was being given to the church. Nor did the mere lease of a bus for transportation by itself aid or advance religion. The district was selling a service to a not-for-profit corporation for legislatively approved purposes. Those distinctions saved the lease from violating the Constitution. There was no realistic danger that the community would think that the district was endorsing religion in the leasing of buses to the church, and any benefit to religion in that context was insignificant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the church's motion for summary judgment and declared that the church was an entity to which the district was authorized to lease buses and the refusal of the district to lease buses to the church because of the religious nature of the not-for-profit corporation and/or the religious content of the instruction to which the buses transported youths would constitute discrimination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - Board of Education - Leasing Buses to Church Education Law &sect; 1501-b (1) (h) authorizes defendant school district to lease buses to plaintiff church, a not-for-profit corporation in a rural community, to transport students from school to and from released-time religious classes located at the church. Education Law &sect; 1501-b (1) (h) directs that a school district may, in its discretion, lease buses to any not-for-profit corporation which provides, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> education or employment for youths or adults in a rural county.  Educational means serving to educate; instructive.  It is impossible to exclude some instruction because of its religious content.  The fact that the material is taught from a religious perspective does not make it any less educational. Thus, the programs to which the students are transported are educational within the statutory definition.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Establishment of Religion - Freedom of Religion - School District's Right to Lease Buses to Church Defendant school district may lease buses to plaintiff church, a not-for-profit corporation located in a rural community, to transport students from school to and from released-time religious classes located at the church without violating any State or Federal constitutional requirement of separation of church and State.  First, the New York Constitution prohibits the use of tax dollars to advance religious purposes and the First Amendment of the US Constitution forbids government from favoring religion over nonreligion.  Here, the leasing of buses to plaintiff does not advance any religious purpose.  It is a straight financial transaction in which not a dollar of taxpayer money is expended.  In addition, the mere lease of a bus for transportation by itself does not aid or advance religion. The district is not providing a service but selling a service to a not-for-profit corporation for legislatively approved purposes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Education Law &sect; 1501-b [1] [h]).  Second, the Establishment Clause prohibits governmental policies that aid or handicap religion. It does not forbid all interaction of church and State.  The District need only satisfy the statutory criteria of the Education Law as to the identity of the organization and the services offered; it need not go beyond these requirements and analyze the content of the educational program offered.  Third, defendant's refusal to lease the buses solely on the basis of the religious viewpoint of the program offered would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer initiated an action alleging that the town illegally disbursed public funds to a retired public employee pursuant to resolutions by the town board. The taxpayer alleged that the town failed to comply with N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect;&sect; 51(90) and (92). The court held that the action was time-barred under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 215(4). The court determined that citizen taxpayer actions under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 51 were subject to the one year statute of limitation set forth in N.Y. C.P.L.R. 215(4) and not the six year limitations period under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 213(1) as asserted by the taxpayer. The court determined that the one year limitations period applied because the taxpayer's action was one to recover monies for the benefit of the political subdivision, similar to claims under article 7-A of the State Finance Law. The court also ruled that the mere showing of an illegal official act was insufficient to warrant relief without proof of potential waste or injury, and in the taxpayer's action there was not a potential waste or injury because the retired employee was entitled to the disbursed funds.</SPAN></P>

General Municipal Law &sect; 90 and 92 authorize governing boards of political subdivisions of the State, including towns, to provide for employee benefits by resolution.  Here, the two resolutions were passed and adopted prior to the effective date of retirement.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner lesbian partner filed an adoption petition to adopt the child of her partner, who was the child's biological mother. The court clerk returned the petition, pursuant to N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 115-b(5), on the ground that the petition was facially incomplete because lesbian partner was not a &quot;qualified adoptive parent,&quot; under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 115(1)(b). Lesbian partner requested that the court accept the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Lesbian partner argued she did not have to &quot;pre-certify,&quot; as the stepparent exemption under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 115-d(8) applied to the case because she wished to adopt the child as a &quot;second parent.&quot; The court held that the lesbian partner established good cause to waive the preplacement certification, as she and the child's biological mother had lived together in a committed relationship for nine years, the child had lived continuously with her biological mother and lesbian partner since her birth, and the biological mother consented to the adoption. The court noted that the child was already in the custody of lesbian partner and would have remained there whether or not the court required lesbian partner to become pre-certified. The court reasoned that &sect; 115(1)(b) was not intended to apply to the case because it was enacted to screen adoptive parents for fitness. Most importantly, the court opined that the language of &sect; 115(1)(b) reflected the traditional nuclear family structure as it existed at the time the statute was enacted, 1938, but that prohibiting homosexual would-be parents from adopting would not have reflected the reality of the 1990s.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adoption - Adoption by Same Sex Couples - Waiver of Preplacement Certification Petitioner, the lesbian partner of a child's biological mother, may adopt the child without obtaining preplacement certification where she has demonstrated good cause to waive such certification. The child has lived continuously with her mother and petitioner, petitioner has already assumed the parental role and is discharging parental responsibilities and the biological mother consents to the proposed adoption. Domestic Relations Law &sect; 115 (1) (b), which mandates that the adoptive parent be certified as a qualified parent, was not intended to apply to these facts and the purpose of the statute would not be advanced by requiring petitioner to become certified as a &quot;qualified adoptive parent&quot; as a condition precedent to her filing the adoption petition. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adoption - Adoption by Same Sex Couples - Application of Preplacement Certification Exemption to Second-Parent Adoption Petitioner, the lesbian partner of a child's biological mother, may adopt the child without obtaining preplacement certification since Domestic Relations Law &sect; 115-d (8), which provides that precertification shall not apply to a petition brought by a stepparent for the adoption of a stepchild where the stepchild has resided with the natural parent and the stepparent for a continuous period of at least one year, exempts petitioner from becoming certified as a &quot;qualified adoptive parent&quot;.  The child has lived continuously with her mother and petitioner, petitioner has already assumed the parental role and is discharging parental responsibilities and the biological mother consents to the proposed adoption. Domestic Relations Law &sect; 115-d (8) should apply to all &quot;second-parent&quot; adoptions.  The purpose of this adoption is not to create a nonmatrimonial legal status for the relationship between the petitioner and the child's biological mother, but to give legal recognition to the child's relationship to her second-parent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adoption - Adoption by Same Sex Couples - Termination of Biological Parent's Rights Petitioner, the lesbian partner of a child's biological mother, may adopt the child without terminating the biological parent's rights, notwithstanding that Domestic Relations Law &sect; 117 (1) (a) automatically relieves the natural parents of all parental duties toward and responsibilities for the child once an order of adoption is made, since Domestic Relations Law &sect; 117 (1) (d) provides that the biological parent's rights will not be terminated where the adoptive parent is a stepparent. The exception in section 117 (1) (d) applies to all &quot;second-parent&quot; adoptions.  Thus, petitioner is not rendered unsuitable to adopt because the biological parent's rights would have to be terminated.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants alleged that an impediment to conviction on the charge of driving with a suspended license, second degree in violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 511(2)(a), existed due to the fact that such revocation could only have been imposed for a finite period and could not have continued indefinitely. The court rejected their arguments and denied their motions, holding that the statute was clear on its face. It imposed a minimum period of revocation and so stated. Nothing could have been clearer than the language of the statute providing for the minimum period of revocation based upon certain occurrences and/or violations of the N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law. The court refused to declare the statute unconstitutional, finding that defendants were well within the statutory period of court &quot;custody,&quot; having been placed on probation and remaining on probation at the time of their arrests. The court held that it would have been acting recklessly if it attempted to set forth a rule which would have had the net effect of decreeing that a one-year revocation was well within the meaning and intent of the statute, but two or three or four years was not.</SPAN></P>

The statute is clear on its face and imposes only a minimum period of revocation. The revocation continues until such time as the holder reapplies for the restoration of driving privileges but the court cannot continue the revocation for a period longer than that which it has the defendant in its &quot;custody&quot;.  Consequently, there is no legal impediment to prosecuting a defendant on a charge of driving with a suspended license in the second degree (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 511 [2] [a]), as opposed to the lesser charge of unlicensed operation (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 509 [1]), where the arrest occurred after the expiration of the minimum revocation period while the defendant was on probation and thus still within the statutory period of court &quot;custody&quot; (CPL 410.50 [1]).  Furthermore, since the crimes of driving with a suspended license in the second degree and operating without a valid driver's license are both of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">malum prohibitum</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nature, the jury must be instructed that they must find that the defendant knew that his driving privileges were revoked, and that the failure of the People to establish scienter on the part of the defendant would warrant a finding of not guilty.  </SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs had been criminally indicted for killing a horse for the insurance proceeds and contended that defendant unreasonably denied them a request for an adjournment during a hearing to prepare their defense and for the opportunity to present exculpatory evidence. Plaintiffs alleged that defendant, in exercising its exclusive control over equestrian sport to bar plaintiffs from competition, violated antitrust provisions of the Donnelly Act, violated plaintiffs' due process rights, and alleged its acts constituted a breach of contract and fiduciary duty. The court denied defendant's motion to vacate a temporary restraining order and held that the determination by defendant suspending plaintiffs was arbitrary and capricious and imposed without a meaningful hearing and in the absence of substantial evidence.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Associations - Suspension from Membership - Validity of Rule Providing for Suspension upon Indictment A rule promulgated by a private association, which governs and controls all horse shows, contests and exhibitions in the United States and the persons deemed eligible to perform therein, providing for suspension or expulsion after a hearing of any person indicted for any act of cruelty or abuse to a horse is not on its face improper, but was improperly applied to suspend plaintiffs, association members who had been indicted for equine insurance fraud, because the hearing afforded was arbitrary, unfair and illusory.  Any member subject to suspension or expulsion from an association which controls its field is entitled to fair notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.  Here, the hearing was called on 20 days' notice and plaintiffs were denied an adjournment to prepare their defense and for the opportunity to present exculpatory evidence unless they would agree to a voluntary suspension. While an indictment and not guilty plea is enough under the association's rules to trigger the requirement for a hearing and, if unrefuted or unexplained, may be the basis for suspension, it cannot be the predicate for suspension without a meaningful hearing as to the merits, an opportunity to present rebuttal evidence and the weighing of alternatives to indefinite suspension. The association's rule calling for such hearing and the exercise of responsible discretion was wholly illusory in its application because the hearing panel considered only whether the indictment alleged cruelty and what the public perceptions might be about the accusations. Nor, in exercising its discretion, did the hearing panel weigh the consequences of suspension on the individuals charged.  Moreover, to the extent the association's rule permits suspension not only of the accused but also the accused's spouse, family members, companions, employees, agents or others, it constitutes a kind of Bill of Attainder.  </SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 24-141, which prohibited the release of detrimental substances into the air, and New York City, N.Y., Rules of the City of New York, tit. 15, &sect; 31-53, which allocated the burden of proof in administrative hearings, unconstitutional, in an action stemming from fines assessed against plaintiff by defendant New York City Environmental Control Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff auto body shop was fined for allowing aerosol paint fumes to escape into the air. In denying plaintiff's motion for judgment, the court held that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 24-141 was not void for vagueness. The court held that the statute gave the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited and that the law provided adequate standards for its application. The court held that the plain meaning of &quot;detriment&quot; in &sect; 24-141 and the definitions of the terms &quot;air contaminant&quot; and &quot;odorous air contaminant&quot; in New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 24-104, together with the non-exclusive list of substances in &sect; 24-141, including paint, the emission of which was proscribed, provided adequate notice to plaintiff. The court next held that New York City, N.Y., Rules of the City of New York, tit. 15, &sect; 31-53, did not violate the U.S. Const. amend. XIV for failure to define the burden of proof, as it was the preponderance of the evidence in civil matters generally, including administrative matters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion for judgment of plaintiff auto body shop.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Regulation of Air Contaminants Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 24-141, which prohibits emission of air contaminants that may cause detriment to the health, safety, welfare or comfort of any person, or injury to plant and animal life, is not unconstitutionally vague on its face or as applied to plaintiffs who were issued notices of violations for emitting paint fumes and noxious cooking odors and fumes, since section 24-141 provides sufficient notice to those to whom it is directed.  A statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face if it specifies no comprehensible standard or guide capable of interpretation or when it cannot validly be applied to any conduct.  The statute here has a core meaning that can reasonably be understood and it can validly be applied.  The terms air contaminant and odorous air contaminant are defined in section 24-104.  The provision is rationally related to the legislative objective which is to protect the health, safety, welfare and comfort of human, plant and animal life. In addition, section 24-141 (b) contains a list of examples of odorous air contaminants, which includes paint. Although section 24-141 (b) does require the exercise of some degree of administrative judgment, it does not have the broad power to punish all emissions. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, charged with trespass in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 140.05, moved for an order pursuant to N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect; 170.30, 170.35, 100.15, and 100.40 dismissing the information on the grounds that the information was facially insufficient and that the instant prosecution was violative of defendant's right to free speech and expression under U.S. Const. amend. I and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the superseding information, filed subsequent to the filing of the instant motion, was facially insufficient. The court held that the factual allegations of the superseding information together with the supporting depositions filed with it were sufficient to establish, if true, each and every element of the offense of trespass and the defendant's commission thereof and established a prima facie case against defendant. The element of knowledge had adequately been pleaded by the nonhearsay factual allegations that defendant was told to stop distributing literature and, on failing to stop, was then told to leave by an authorized representative of the church and by police officers. Whether defendant actually possessed the requisite knowledge upon which to base a conviction for trespass was a factual issue which must be determined at trial. On the issue of freedom of expression, the court applied the factors in Melara to find that defendant failed to demonstrate a significant degree of State involvement in the church feast sufficient to support a finding that the allegedly unconstitutional conduct of the church and its representatives constituted State action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to dismiss was denied. The fact that defendant may have had a defense of knowledge, to the prosecution did not provide a ground upon which to dismiss the information for facial insufficiency. Defendant failed to demonstrate a significant degree of State involvement sufficient to support a finding that the allegedly unconstitutional conduct of the church and its representatives constituted State action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Information - Facial Sufficiency - Trespass Charge against Political Candidate Distributing Literature at Church Festival The information charging defendant political candidate with trespass arising from his distribution of campaign literature on church premises during a festival is facially sufficient.  The superseding information contained nonhearsay factual allegations indicating that posted signs prohibited distribution of literature and that complainant, a representative of the church, and police officers requested defendant to cease distribution, and when defendant refused to stop they asked defendant to leave the premises.  In addition, two supporting depositions confirmed that complainant had authority to exclude from church premises any person who intentionally violated diocese and church rules, that signs were posted and that the police were instructed to arrest anyone who refused to cease distribution of literature and to leave church property. The factual allegations of the superseding information together with the supporting depositions establish, if true, each and every element of the offense of trespass and defendant's commission thereof.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - State Involvement in Church Festival Defendant political candidate, who was arrested for trespass when attempting to distribute literature at a church feast against a diocese and church rule, was not denied his right to freedom of speech since he failed to demonstrate a significant degree of State involvement in the church feast sufficient to support a finding that the allegedly unconstitutional conduct of the church and its representatives constituted State action.  The source of authority for the private action is not derived from the State, but is instead a private diocese and church rule prohibiting the distribution of literature on church property. Also, merely because a town building permit and gambling and liquor permits were required for the function does not elevate the private activity to the level of State action.  In addition, the presence of police officers to patrol the church grounds and enforce church rules does not constitute meaningful State participation in the private activity.  Finally, gambling, sale of alcoholic beverages and a park-like atmosphere did not effect a delegation of a traditional State function to the church sufficient to support a finding of State action.  A private activity is not deemed to constitute State action merely because it is subject to State regulation. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought dismissal of the charges against him for unlicensed general vending in violation of New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 20-453.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold photographs of individually posed combinations of his backdrops with persons at a particular location. Defendant contended that &sect; 20-453 did not apply to his activities because he was engaged in &quot;street performance&quot; and that his activities were an artistic expression protected by the First Amendment. Dismissing the charges against defendant, the court held that &sect; 20-453 did not apply to defendant's activities because he sold memorializations of performances rather than &quot;goods&quot; or &quot;wares&quot; and thus defendant did not fit the definition of a &quot;general vendor&quot; contained in New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 20-452. The court determined that even if New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 20-453 was applicable, the regulation was unconstitutional as applied to defendant because, although it was content-neutral and sufficiently narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, it did not leave defendant an ample alternative channel for communication of his expression. Licenses were only available on a first-come, first-served basis and the wait for a license was more than five years. Thus, defendant was effectively foreclosed from communicating his ideas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Unlicensed General Vending - Photographing Tourists on City Street for Fee The complaint charging defendant with unlicensed general vending and failure to display an appropriate tax certificate (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 20-453) arising from defendant having charged $ 5 to take photographs of people in front of a backdrop cloth on a city street is dismissed since the physical portion of what defendant sells--memorialization of his individually posed and stylized performances--does not fit the statutory language of &quot;goods&quot; or &quot;services&quot;, and defendant does not fit the definition of &quot;general vendor&quot; within the meaning of Administrative Code &sect; 20-452.  The photographs do not exist until after defendant has completed his performance and since they are all different, they are not souvenir photographs. In addition, the photograph cannot be displayed or spread out for viewing by any potential customer because it does not exist.  Rather, the activities are comparable to those of a street musician or mime, because these types of activities involve no possession of wares or stock of goods on display. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Photographing Tourists on City Street for Fee Defendant's activities in charging $ 5 to take a person's picture in front of a backdrop cloth on a city street are &quot;protected expression&quot; by the First Amendment of the US and NY Constitutions even though his street performing and photographic endeavors may never be displayed in a museum or formal forum for the display of &quot;art&quot;, since his expressive purpose is to perform for any audience which wishes to see, hear and/or participate and to produce and memorialize festive and joyous figurative and literal pictures of the city.  Neither defendant's photographic endeavors, nor the sale of them, are outside the protection of either State or Federal First Amendment protection of expression.  Thus, the activities, being &quot;expression&quot; (whether or not they are &quot;art&quot;), are constitutionally protected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Time, Place and Manner Restrictions - Photographing Tourists on City Street for Fee The unlicensed vending regulation (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 20-453), which requires vendors to annually obtain a license to lawfully sell goods or services on the street, is unconstitutional as applied to defendant who, without a vendor's license, charged $ 5 to take a person's picture in front of a backdrop cloth on a city street, since the regulation is not reasonably limited as to the time, place and manner of defendant's expression.  To be reasonable, such restrictions must be content-neutral, narrowly tailored and leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.  The vending licenses are issued on a first-come, first-served basis and the waiting period is at least five years.  Although the licensing restriction is content-neutral and narrowly tailored to serve the legitimate interest of regulating and maintaining pedestrian traffic, it appears unconstitutional as applied here because it closes off the only method for defendant to capture and communicate the idea he wishes to express--performance and photographic memorialization, with street audience participation in a bustling street setting.  He is precluded from using the desired public location within any reasonable time because of the license unavailability, and he is deprived of what he claims are elements of his expression--street sights, sounds and atmosphere.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered the motions for summary judgment filed by petitioners, landowner and buyer, and the opposition to the motions filed by respondents, State and State attorney general (State), and the State's motion for leave to conduct discovery.

The court denied the motions for summary judgment and granted the motion for leave to conduct discovery. The court held that &sect; 12(1) applied to the landowner's sale of the property to the buyer, and that under &sect; 12(1) the modifications were each new contracts which also had to be approved by the court.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious Corporations and Associations - Sale of Real Property - Court Approval Plaintiff Greek Orthodox Church, which contracted to sell church-owned property that was not used as a place of worship, was required to obtain court approval of the sale pursuant to Religious Corporations Law &sect; 12.  Religious Corporations Law &sect; 12 (1) provides that a &quot;religious corporation shall not sell, mortgage or lease for a term exceeding five years any of its real property without applying for and obtaining leave of the court&quot;.  The language of the statute, i.e., &quot;any of its real property&quot;, does not limit application of the statute to property used as a place of worship. Had the Legislature intended to limit section 12 it could have done so.  Thus, section 12 applies to the sale, mortgage or lease of any real property by a religious corporation, not merely to property used as a place of worship. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious Corporations and Associations - Sale of Real Property - Court Approval for Subsequent Contract Modifications Where plaintiff Greek Orthodox Church contracted to sell church-owned land with court approval </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Religious Corporations Law &sect; 12), and subsequently modified the contract of sale regarding price, the church is required to obtain nunc pro tunc approval of said modifications </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Religious Corporations Law &sect; 12 [9]).  Religious Corporations Law &sect; 12 (1) applies when a religious corporation shall &quot;sell, mortgage or lease for a term exceeding five years any of its real property&quot;.  A modification of a contract results in the establishment of a new agreement between the parties which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">pro tanto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supplants the affected provisions of the original agreement while leaving the balance of the agreement intact.  Thus, by entering into an agreement to modify the price to be paid on the original contract the church entered into a new contract of sale which had to be approved by the court pursuant to section 12 (1).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Notice to Attorney-General of Sale of Church Property - Establishment of Religion Religious Corporations Law &sect; 12 and 2-b (1) (d-1), which provide that certain churches are required to notify the Attorney-General when obtaining leave of court to sell, mortgage or lease real property, do not intrude into or entangle with the internal affairs of plaintiff Greek Orthodox Church which sold certain of its real property and, thus, they pass constitutional muster pursuant to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Lemon v Kurtzman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (403 US 602). The notice insures that the sale is in the best interest of the corporation and its members and that the proceeds are properly disbursed.  The purpose is secular and the statute was not motivated by an intent to endorse or disapprove religion. Also, the notice neither advances nor inhibits religion. The notice requirement does not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion. Routine regulatory interaction, such as the notice requirement, which involves no inquiries into religious doctrine, no delegation of State power to a religious body and no detailed monitoring and close administrative contact between secular and religious bodies, does not violate the nonentanglement command.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Notice to Attorney-General of Sale of Church Property - Freedom of Religion Religious Corporations Law &sect; 12 and 2-b (1) (d-1), which provide that certain churches are required to notify the Attorney-General when obtaining leave of court to sell, mortgage or lease real property, do not violate the Freedom of Religion Clause.  The notice requirement has no effect on and places no burden on the members of the church to practice their religion--either by pressuring them to commit some act forbidden by their religion or by preventing them from engaging in conduct mandated by their faith.  Any inquiry by the Attorney-General only involves the terms of the real estate transaction; it involves no inquiry into religious beliefs nor does it involve the regulation or prohibition of conduct undertaken for religious reasons.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Notice to Attorney-General of Sale of Church Property - Discrimination among Religions Religious Corporations Law &sect; 12 and 2-b (1) (d-1), which require that certain churches, including plaintiff Greek Orthodox Church, notify the Attorney-General when obtaining leave of court to sell, mortgage or lease real property, while other churches which are hierarchically structured are not required to notify the Attorney-General, do not discriminate between religious denominations since they meet a compelling State interest and are narrowly tailored. Hierarchically structured churches must obtain approval by their top executive to protect against abuse in the transfer of real property and the statutory notice affords nonhierarchical corporations the same type of safeguards, thereby satisfying a compelling State interest.  Also, the statute is narrowly tailored, particularly as applied to plaintiff church, which failed to notify the Attorney-General of a sale of real property, since plaintiff failed to prove it is a hierarchical church, and did not demonstrate that the church structure protects its members from abuses in the transfer of real property. Where the particular church does not assure that its members have an opportunity to review the sale of real property, the statute provides for notice to the Attorney-General to allow the Attorney-General to perform that role in a particular proceeding.  As such, the de minimis statutory obligation of notice to the Attorney-General is narrowly tailored to meet its objectives.  </SPAN></P>

The Legislature clearly omitted from section 511-d any language referring to mental culpability. Moreover, section 511-d's reference to Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 226 does not build a notice requirement into section 511-d.  Section 226 (3) (a), pertaining to the suspension of the privilege to drive for failing to answer, does not include a notice requirement; although section 226 (3) (b), which provides for a default conviction, imposes a notice requirement, it is inapplicable here since the People are proceeding under section 226 (3) (a) rather than section 226 (3) (b).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff community group and defendant city sought summary judgment in plaintiff's action against defendant seeking to have a gun control ordinance declared invalid and illegal and to permanently enjoin defendant from enforcing the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff community group brought an action against defendant city in which it sought to have a gun control ordinance declared invalid and illegal. Plaintiffs and defendant sought summary judgment. The court found that the gun control ordinance did not constitute an impermissible ban but rather a reasonable regulation as to place and circumstances of possession. The court held that defendant had the right to enforce the ordinance to the extent that it restricted the possession of semiautomatic rifles and shotguns, possessed simultaneously with ammunition feeding devices, resulting in a combined capacity of six rounds or more, and/or with the specified accessories. The court found that the defendant had the right to enforce the rest of the ordinance except for the portions that sought to regulate guns made by certain manufacturers and to regulate air guns and imitation weapons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that defendant city had the right to enforce the gun control ordinance to the extent that it restricted the possession of certain guns. The court found for plaintiff community group in part, holding that defendant could not enforce the portions of the ordinance which regulated specific manufacturers' guns, air guns, and imitation weapons.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Right to Bear Arms - Validity of Municipal Gun Control Law A municipal gun control ordinance, which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proscribes possession of semiautomatic rifles and shotguns having ammunition feeding devices permitting them to be loaded with a combination of more than six rounds in the feeding device and chamber, is a valid exercise of the police power that does not violate the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The Second Amendment limits only the power of Congress to infringe upon the right to keep and bear arms necessary for the militia; it creates no bar to State or local action.  Furthermore, plaintiffs' Second Amendment challenge to the ordinance must also fail since all members of the military as well as military uses of firearms are exempted under the express terms of the ordinance, the guns subject to the law are not military weapons, and plaintiffs have not alleged that they are members of the State or Federal National Guard, nor that the banned weapons are in use by these military groups.  Moreover, the State and Federal National Guard constitute the &quot;well regulated militia&quot; of the Second Amendment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights - Right to Bear Arms - Regulation of Semiautomatic Rifles and Shotguns A municipal gun control ordinance, which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proscribes possession of semiautomatic rifles and shotguns having ammunition feeding devices permitting them to be loaded with a combination of more than six rounds in the feeding device and chamber, is a lawful exercise of the police power that does not contravene Civil Rights Law &sect; 4 which establishes the right to keep and bear arms for a &quot;well regulated militia&quot;.  Plaintiffs have failed to meet the burden of demonstrating that the weapons proscribed by the ordinance will be used for the purpose specified in Civil Rights Law &sect; 4 and that they have more than a mere technical association with an unorganized, reserve militia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Control of Guns - Regulation of Semiautomatic Rifles and Shotguns A municipal gun control ordinance, which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proscribes possession of semiautomatic rifles and shotguns having ammunition feeding devices permitting them to be loaded with a combination of more than six rounds in the feeding device and chamber, is a lawful exercise of the police power. The ordinance does not constitute a ban on all military-style rifles without regard to the circumstances of possession, but rather a reasonable regulation as to place and circumstances of possession.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Federal Preemption - Regulation of Semiautomatic Rifles and Shotguns A municipal gun control ordinance, which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proscribes possession of semiautomatic rifles and shotguns having ammunition feeding devices permitting them to be loaded with a combination of more than six rounds in the feeding device and chamber, is a lawful exercise of the police power that is not preempted by Federal law because of conflicts with the Civilian Marksmanship Program (10 USC &sect;&sect; 4307-4317).  There is no conflict between the stated purposes of the Program, which permits participating gun clubs to store and possess certain weapons so long as they are stored in conformity with local law (32 CFR 543.17), and the challenged ordinance. Furthermore, since there are no licensed shooting galleries or ranges within defendant City, no competition or training conducted under the auspices of the Program could occur within the City limits, the only geographical area in which the law is applicable.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Laws - Preemption by State - Regulation of Semiautomatic Rifles and Shotguns A municipal gun control ordinance, which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proscribes possession of semiautomatic rifles and shotguns having ammunition feeding devices permitting them to be loaded with a combination of more than six rounds in the feeding device and chamber, is a lawful exercise of the police power that is not preempted by State gun control laws.  The State has not, either directly or indirectly, regulated all aspects of gun possession and use as to time, place and circumstance.  General Municipal Law &sect; 139-d, which regulates commercial storage of firearms and explosives, does not evince a legislative intent to prohibit regulation by a municipality of the individual possession of semiautomatic rifles or shotguns. However, local regulation of &quot;air guns&quot;, spring guns, and imitation arms is preempted by State and Federal laws (General Business Law &sect; 871 [2]; 15 USC &sect; 5001 [g]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Regulation of Semiautomatic Rifles and Shotguns A municipal gun control ordinance, which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proscribes possession of semiautomatic rifles and shotguns having ammunition feeding devices permitting them to be loaded with a combination of more than six rounds in the feeding device and chamber and which limits an individual from selling a gun within the City except through a licensed gun dealer, is a lawful exercise of the police power and does not constitute a taking of property and an unlawful interference with the dominion and control of a property.  The ordinance does not in any way seek to control the disposition of a licensed firearm within the City, nor does it seek to control any intrafamily transfer of a gun. The ordinance imposes no limits on gunsmiths or licensed gun dealers and imposes no fees on the transfer of any gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Regulation of Semiautomatic Rifles and Shotguns A municipal gun control ordinance, which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proscribes possession of semiautomatic rifles and shotguns having ammunition feeding devices permitting them to be loaded with a combination of more than six rounds in the feeding device and chamber and which limits an individual from selling a gun within the City except through a licensed gun dealer, is a lawful exercise of the police power. Constitutional free speech rights are not violated by the ordinance's limitation on the private advertisement for sale of guns within the City.  Regulation of commercial speech that is narrowly tailored, as here, to achieve the legitimate governmental purpose of limiting the proliferation of illegally possessed firearms, is not violative of constitutional free speech rights.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Control of Guns - Regulation of Semiautomatic Rifles and Shotguns - No Infringement on Right to Self-Defense A municipal gun control ordinance, which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proscribes possession of semiautomatic rifles and shotguns having ammunition feeding devices permitting them to be loaded with a combination of more than six rounds in the feeding device and chamber, is a lawful exercise of the police power that does not unlawfully infringe upon the right to self-defense.  The limitation of the kinds of guns or the number of rounds available in a single magazine, detailed in the ordinance, is not an important component of self-defense.  Therefore, the ordinance has no impact on the statutory right to defend oneself.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Declaratory Judgments - When Remedy Appropriate - Validity of Chemical Testing Provision of Municipal Gun Control Ordinance A declaratory judgment action is not a proper remedy to determine the validity of a municipal gun control ordinance which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> provides for chemical testing for the alcohol and drug content of the blood of individuals possessing firearms, rifles, shotguns, or air guns in public places.  Plaintiffs have shown no controversy involving an immediate threat of injury arising from the obligation to consent to blood or alcohol tests as required by the ordinance and they therefore lack standing to seek declaratory relief relative to this provision.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Control of Guns - Delegation of Authority to Chief of Police A municipal gun control ordinance, which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> specifically provides that the chief of police may grant permits to persons seeking to shoot clay pigeons or to target shoot at ranges, does not create an invalid delegation of legislative authority to the chief of police.  Rather, the ordinance grants the chief of police authority of a very specific nature, reasonably limited, in relation to the complexity of the particular area to be regulated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Regulation of Semiautomatic Rifles and Shotguns A municipal gun control ordinance, which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proscribes possession of semiautomatic rifles and shotguns having ammunition feeding devices permitting them to be loaded with a combination of more than six rounds in the feeding device and chamber, is violative of equal protection to the extent that it further prohibits certain specifically named assault weapons without regard to magazine capacity while excluding other identical assault-type weapons produced by different manufacturers. While the regulation of various types of weapons may be related to a legitimate State purpose, the ordinance's unequal treatment of identical weapons cannot withstand an equal protection challenge since there is no difference in the danger posed to society by identical guns produced by different manufacturers, and no such distinction can be found through an exercise of reason.  Accordingly, to the extent that the ordinance names individual weapons and excludes others that are identical, it may not be enforced by the City.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgments - Summary Judgment - Submission of Sworn Proof In a declaratory judgment action to determine the validity of a municipal gun control ordinance, defendant City sufficiently resisted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment by submitting sworn proof in the form of an affidavit of a City official which sets forth the items, facts, and primary sources of information upon which the City Council relied in adopting the legislation.  The City Council was not limited to enacting legislation only upon sworn evidence.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Control of Guns - Regulation of Semiautomatic Rifles and Shotguns A municipal gun control ordinance, which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proscribes possession of semiautomatic rifles and shotguns having ammunition feeding devices permitting them to be loaded with a combination of more than six rounds in the feeding device and chamber, is a valid exercise of the police power since there is a rational relationship between the control of semiautomatic weapons and and a legitimate municipal interest.  The underlying investigation conducted by the City Council presented a state of facts from which a rational relationship between the ordinance and a legitimate municipal interest may be presumed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Control of Guns - Regulation of &quot;Air Guns&quot; - Vagueness The portion of a municipal gun control ordinance which seeks to regulate &quot;air guns&quot; is vague and overbroad, and thus unenforceable, to the extent that the ordinance's definition of &quot;air guns&quot; would include and make criminal, not only traditional &quot;air guns&quot;, but also such items as staple and nailing guns, slingshots, and many toys.  When read as a whole, the law does not give individuals within the City reasonable notice of prohibited conduct.  Those charged with enforcement of the law would almost certainly be compelled to discriminatory enforcement to avoid an otherwise unintended result of arresting all housing contractors, handymen, and many of the City's children for technical violations of the law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with one count of unlawful solicitation, or begging, in the subway, in violation of N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 21, &sect; 1050.6(b)(2). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument on grounds that the city transit authority rule, which banned all begging in the New York City transit system, was violative of freedom of speech as guaranteed by the N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court reviewed the scope of the freedom of speech under the state constitution and, while it agreed that the state constitution granted greater protection to the individual liberties and rights of its citizens than the Federal Constitution, denied defendant's motion, concluding that the rule did not violate defendant's freedom of speech under the New York Constitution. The court reasoned that while begging was a form of protected speech, the transit system was a nonpublic forum, open only to limited speech activities, and expressly not extended to begging. Because the regulation against begging was reasonable, to provide safe and efficient transportation to passengers, the restriction was not violative of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion because the rule did not violate defendant's freedom of speech under the New York Constitution; while begging was a form of protected speech, the transit system was a nonpublic forum, open only to limited speech activities, and expressly not extended to begging.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Validity of Ban on Begging in New York City Transit System A rule of the New York City Transit Authority which bans all begging in the New York City transit system (21 NYCRR 1050.6 [b] [2]), but allows solicitation for needy causes by registered charities, is not unconstitutional as violative of freedom of speech as guaranteed by the New York Constitution (art I, &sect; 8), whether the ban on begging is viewed as content-based or merely as an incidental restriction on expressive activity. The Authority's ban on begging satisfies the constitutional requirement that a government restriction on access in a nonpublic forum, such as the transit system, be reasonable and viewpoint neutral.  While begging is constitutionally protected speech, begging can lawfully be banned within the limited boundaries of the transit system as a reasonable safety precaution.  Furthermore, the distinction made between beggars and organized charities is a reasonable one in light of the nature and function of the transit system. The inherently alarming quality of solicitations by individual beggars approaching passengers in close and confined passageways and on narrow platforms is an intrinsically dangerous situation, both in terms of potential accidents and in terms of increased assaults and thefts.  Additionally, registered charities may be investigated and overseen, limiting the risk of fraudulent solicitations. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to vacate conviction pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10(1)(h). The court found that defendant satisfied none of the elements to vacate the conviction pursuant to &sect; 440.10(1)(h). Defendant did not object to the language of the charge on an element of the crime. Defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of evidence made no reference to her knowledge of the weight of the narcotics, thus at no point during trial did defendant preserve that specific issue for appellate review. Nor did defendant's appeal raise the specific issue that she presented in this motion. At trial the prosecution based their case on the &quot;drug factory&quot; statutory presumption in N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Vacatur of Judgement of Conviction A judgment convicting defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance based upon the &quot;drug factory&quot; statutory presumption of possession (Penal Law &sect; 220.25 [2]) should not be vacated under CPL 440.10 (1) (h) as having been obtained in violation of due process of law because the trial court failed to instruct the jury on her knowledge of the weight of the narcotic allegedly possessed pursuant to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Ryan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (82 NY2d 497). Defendant did not register any objection to the language used by the court in defining the elements of each crime and the People's burden with respect to each element, and stated a single general objection to the fact that the room presumption was charged.  Moreover, defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of evidence made no reference whatever to the specific issue of knowledge of the weight of the narcotics. Thus, defendant did not preserve for appellate review the specific issue whether the People adduced legally sufficient evidence establishing that she had knowledge of the weight of the narcotics (CPL 470.05 [2]).  Nor did defendant's appeal raise the specific issue which she raises in this motion.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Controlled Substances - Effect of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Ryan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on &quot;Drug Factory&quot; Presumption The statutory &quot;drug factory&quot; presumption (Penal Law &sect; 220.25 [2]) of &quot;knowing possession&quot; of a narcotic drug in open view in a room by each and every person in close proximity to the narcotic drug at the time of discovery is unaffected by the holding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Ryan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (82 NY2d 497) that &quot;knowing possession&quot; as used in Penal Law article 220 includes knowledge of both the nature and weight of the substance possessed and, therefore, that there is a mens rea element associated with the weight of drug.  The clear and unambiguous purpose of section 220.25 (2) is to provide proof of knowing possession for narcotics found in the specific circumstances delineated in the statute.  To limit the applicability of the presumption to the nature of the substance, and thereby exclude it from the quantity, ignores the language of the statute and eviscerates the intent of the Legislature.  Accordingly, where defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance based upon the &quot;drug factory&quot; presumption, it cannot be said with respect to her CPL 440.10 motion to vacate the judgment of conviction after the direct appeal process had been concluded through retroactive application of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Ryan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> holding that there has been, since the appeal a retroactively effective change in the law controlling such issue.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Vacatur of Judgment of Conviction - Retroactive Application of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Ryan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Failure to Preserve Issue or Pursue Issue in Perfected Appeal Where defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance based upon the &quot;drug factory&quot; presumption of possession (Penal Law &sect; 220.25 [2]), her motion pursuant to CPL 440.10 (2) (a) to vacate the judgment of conviction made after the direct appeal process had been concluded seeking retroactive application to her case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Ryan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (82 NY2d 497) cannot be entertained.  An appellate court, evaluating defendant's claim of error at the trial, clearly would have found sufficient facts within the four corners of the record of defendant's trial to adjudicate defendant's claim.  Defendant failed to preserve the issue in the trial court and to pursue the specific issue in the appeal which was eventually perfected.  Such unjustifiable failure cannot serve to expand appellate review through collateral attack in direct contravention of CPL 440.10 (2) (c).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Vacatur of Judgment of Conviction - Writ of Error Coram Nobis A motion by defendant to vacate the judgment convicting her of criminal possession of a controlled substance based on the court's inherent power to issue a writ of error coram nobis is denied.  The claim of error asserted--that the People presented no evidence at trial of her knowledge of the weight of the heroin she allegedly possessed in contravention of the holding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Ryan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (82 NY2d 497), which she seeks to have retroactively applied to her case in which the direct appeal process has been concluded--is covered by CPL 440.10 and, thus, resort to coram nobis is unavailable.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly contacted six boys ranging in age from 12 to 15, through a computer bulletin board. Once he made contact, defendant had numerous phone conversations with said children where he claimed an ability to hypnotize them and directed them to masturbate. Defendant was arrested and charged him with four counts of endangering the welfare of a child. Defendant maintained that the police coerced him into making his statement and into consenting to a search of his residence. The court held that defendant's right to free speech was not violated. The government's interest in protecting children was firmly established in case law and the restrictions on defendant's right to have sexually explicit conversations with children was not constitutionally guaranteed. The court also denied defendant's motion to dismiss the complaints on the grounds that they were duplicitous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motions to dismiss the accusatory statements against him because the criminal informations satisfied the statutory requirements and the informations were not conclusory and therefore were sufficient. Plaintiff was not required to provide depositions, expert or otherwise, stating how the alleged phone conversations were injurious to the moral welfare of children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Endangering Welfare of Child - Engaging in Sexual Conversations on Telephone - Freedom of Speech Defendant was appropriately charged with a violation of Penal Law &sect; 260.10 (1), endangering the welfare of a child, for allegedly calling children on the telephone and engaging in sexual conversations. The statute is not an unconstitutional restriction on defendant's right to free speech. The legislative intent of this statute is to protect the physical health, morals, and well-being of children, and defendant's alleged solicitude relates not only to sexual offenses but to other dangers as well.  Also, nothing in the language of the statute, its legislative history, or the case law indicates this statute is meant to curtail acts and not speech and, thus, the statute does proscribe defendant's alleged activity.  In addition, the right to free speech is not absolute.  Where there is a compelling State interest, such as the interest here to protect the well-being of children, restrictions on speech may exist.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Endangering Welfare of Child - Overbreadth - Vagueness Penal Law &sect; 260.10 (1), endangering the welfare of a child, is not overly broad or vague and, thus, defendant was appropriately charged with a violation of section 260.10 (1) when he allegedly called children on the telephone and engaged in sexual conversations. In order for a statute to be constitutional, the statute must give notice to the accused of the illegality of his act.  Section 260.10 (1) uses ordinary terms to express ideas which find adequate interpretation in common usage and understanding.  The statute gives notice that a person may not knowingly engage in conduct which is likely to be injurious to the physical, mental, or moral welfare of a child.  Here, defendant knowingly contacted six children between the ages of 12 and 15 and allegedly encouraged, instructed and directed them to masturbate. This is precisely the sort of behavior that the statute intends to prohibit.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Information - Sufficiency of Information Charging Endangering Welfare of Child The criminal information charging defendant with violations of Penal Law &sect; 260.10 (1), endangering the welfare of a child, for allegedly calling children on the telephone and engaging in sexual conversations, satisfies CPL 100.15 and 100.40 and, therefore, should not be dismissed.  CPL 100.15 and 100.40 require that the information contain both an accusatory part designating the offenses charged and a factual part containing nonhearsay allegations which provide reasonable cause to believe that the defendant committed the offense.  The information in this case contains both parts.  In addition, the information is not conclusory. Although the People did not provide depositions stating how the alleged phone conversations were injurious to the moral welfare of the children, the victims' depositions describe in detail what, when and how the defendant committed the alleged crimes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Information - Duplicitous Information - Endangering Welfare of Child - Crime Committed by Multiple Acts The criminal information charging defendant with violations of Penal Law &sect; 260.10 (1), endangering the welfare of a child, for allegedly calling children on the telephone and engaging in sexual conversations, was not duplicitous. CPL 200.30 prohibits duplicitous counts in accusatory instruments, requiring that each count of an indictment may charge only one offense.  Crimes which by nature may be committed either by a single act or by multiple acts do not necessarily encompass more than one offense and are not duplicitous. Endangering the welfare of a child by its nature may be committed by multiple acts, and readily permits characterization as a continuing offense over a period of time. Thus, the fact that the depositions contain allegations of more than one conversation with the complainants does not render the information duplicitous. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Information - Duplicitous Information - Endangering Welfare of Child - Sufficiency of Notice of Time, Place and Manner of Offense Charged The criminal information charging defendant with violations of Penal Law &sect; 260.10 (1), endangering the welfare of a child, for allegedly calling children on the telephone and engaging in sexual conversations, was not duplicitous or in violation of US Constitution Sixth Amendment and NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 6 on the ground that it failed to provide the accused with fair notice of the charges and the manner, time and place of the underlying conduct in order to allow the defendant to prepare a defense.  The depositions alleging phone conversations &quot;about one year ago&quot; and &quot;during the month of November 1993&quot; do give defendant sufficient notice of the charges against him.  Unless a date is itself an essential ingredient of the crime, it is not vital to the sufficiency of an indictment. Here, the supporting depositions and informations set forth the approximate date and time of each violation.  Moreover, each information alleges a different offense involving a different victim, and notifies defendant of the charges against him, the place of the occurrence, and how defendant perpetrated the crime.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff individuals filed an action against defendant state that sought a declaration that 1994 N.Y. Laws 241 and 279 were unconstitutional. The individuals applied for a temporary restraining order and for preliminary injunctive relief enjoining implementation of chapters 241 and 279.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals contended that 1994 N.Y. Laws 241 and 279, which was enacted when the United States Supreme Court found that 1989 N.Y. Laws 748 violated the Establishment of Religion Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, was unconstitutional as well. The court held that facially, under chapters 241 and 279, the conditions established for the creation of the new school district were religion-neutral, reasonable and appropriate, and effectuated a legitimate state function. The manner in which the new school district was to be created further assured a religion-neutral shield to the new legislation. The court held that the individuals had not demonstrated the irreparable harm required in order for a temporary restraining order to have been granted. Nor had the individuals met their heavy burden of likelihood of ultimate success. The court noted that but for a declaration of unconstitutionality, the relief sought was exactly the relief sought by the individuals in their complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injunctions - Temporary Restraining Order - Enjoining Funding and Operation of New School District Plaintiffs are not entitled to a temporary restraining order to enjoin funding and operation of a school district, formed under chapters 241 and 279 of the Laws of 1994 and located in a municipality comprised mostly of Hasidic Jews.  The relief requested is the same relief sought by plaintiffs in their complaint, but for a declaration that the statutes are unconstitutional.  Temporary injunctions which give the same relief expected to be obtained by final judgment are granted with caution and only when required by urgent situations or grave necessity, and then only on the clearest of evidence.  First, plaintiffs have not met their heavy burden of likelihood of ultimate success on the merits.  Facially, the conditions established by the Legislature for the creation of new school districts under chapter 241 appear religion-neutral, reasonable, and appropriate, and effectuate a legitimate State function.  Second, plaintiffs' claim, as citizen-taxpayers, that they will suffer irreparable harm because moneys for the school year will be unconstitutionally disbursed and expended is meritless.  No harm is apparent inasmuch as the State aid will be disbursed for the education of the children regardless of the school district they attend.  Third, the balance of equities does not favor plaintiffs.  An injunction would have serious disruptive effects on defendants and the children.  In addition, dissolution of the school district pending the outcome would cause administrative expense and disruption for no practical reason and to no effect.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filmmaker filed an action in the Supreme Court of New York, seeking monetary damages and equitable relief from defendant cable company for its refusal to broadcast portions of her films. The cable company sought a grant of its motion to dismiss the complaint, or a declaratory judgment that N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 829(3)&nbsp;unconstitutionally infringed its free speech interests and press rights, and, alternatively, was preempted by federal law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The filmmaker filed an action against the cable company, seeking equitable relief and damages, after it refused to air portions of the filmmaker's non-obscene films. The court granted the filmmaker's cross-motion to compel the broadcast of her film but dismissed the remainder of the action. The court held that (1) N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 829(c) was not preempted by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-549, codified at 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 521 et seq., because both merely forbade the cable company from editing non-obscene programming on public educational and government (PEG) access channels; (2) N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 829(c) did not abridge the cable company's free speech rights because it contained a content-neutral prohibition against editorial control of PEG channel programming that burdened no more speech than was necessary to promote the substantial government interest in fostering public programming; (3) The filmmaker was collaterally estopped from pursuing federal constitutional claims that she had already litigated; and (4) The filmmaker lacked standing to claim that the cable company violated her N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 rights because it was not a state actor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the filmmaker's cross-motion to compel the broadcast of her films, but dismissed the remainder of the action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio and Television - Cable Television - Censorship Prohibited on Public Access Channels - No Federal Preemption Plaintiff's action for equitable relief and monetary damages based upon defendant cable television company's cancellation of plaintiff's scheduled public access program, allegedly in violation of Executive Law &sect; 829 (3), which prohibits censorship on public access channels, is not preempted by the Federal Cable Television Consumer Protection Act of 1992 (Pub L 102-385, amending 47 USC &sect; 521 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Federal law also forbids a cable operator from exercising editorial control over public access programming unless the programming contains obscene or sexually explicit materials or materials soliciting or promoting unlawful conduct. Plaintiff's program only involved allegations of misconduct by a home improvement contractor.  In the absence of any allegations that plaintiff's program is obscene, sexually explicit, or that it solicits or promotes unlawful conduct, there is no conflict between the operations of the State and Federal statutes.  In either case, defendant is prohibited from exercising editorial control over public access programming. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio and Television - Cable Television - Prohibition against Censorship of Public Access Programming Not Violative of Cable Operator's Constitutional Right to Freedom of Speech Executive Law &sect; 829 (3), which prohibits a cable operator from exercising editorial control over its public educational and government access programming, does not unconstitutionally abridge defendant cable television company's First Amendment right to freedom of speech so as to require dismissal of plaintiff's action for equitable relief and monetary damages based upon defendant's alleged violation of the statute in refusing to broadcast on its public access channel material submitted by plaintiff.  The statute's incidental restriction on the First Amendment rights of cable operators survives constitutional scrutiny under the intermediate balancing test applicable to such a content-neutral regulation since the regulation promotes the substantial governmental interest of enhancing and encouraging public interest in cable television by providing speakers with lesser market appeal access to cable systems.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgments - Collateral Estoppel - Cable Operator's Refusal to Broadcast Public Access Programming In plaintiff's action for equitable relief and monetary damages based upon defendant cable television company's refusal to broadcast on its public access channel material submitted by plaintiff, the causes of action alleging a violation of plaintiff's constitutionally protected rights to freedom of speech and press are dismissed on collateral estoppel grounds.  The determination made in plaintiff's related Federal action that plaintiff did not state a claim under the United States Constitution because defendants were private persons and not State actors bars plaintiff from relitigating that issue in this action.  Similarly, the lack of State involvement also bars any State constitutional claims.  The fact that a cable company is considered a public utility does not imbue any of the defendants with the power or authority of the State.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negligence - What Constitutes - Cable Operator's Cancellation of Scheduled Public Access Programming In plaintiff's action for equitable relief and monetary damages based upon defendant cable television company's refusal to broadcast on its public access channel material submitted by plaintiff, the cause of action alleging that defendants were negligent in cancelling plaintiff's scheduled programming must be dismissed since the undisputed facts clearly demonstrate that defendants intentionally cancelled plaintiff's program.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libel and Slander - Actionable Words - Cable Operator's Cancellation of Scheduled Public Access Programming In plaintiff's action for equitable relief and monetary damages based upon defendant cable television company's refusal to broadcast on its public access channel material submitted by plaintiff, the cause of action alleging damage to plaintiff's reputation must be dismissed since the complaint does not allege, nor do the facts indicate, that defendants engaged in either libel or slander. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negligence - Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress - Cable Operator's Cancellation of Scheduled Public Access Programming In plaintiff's action for equitable relief and monetary damages based upon defendant cable television company's refusal to broadcast on its public access channel material submitted by plaintiff involving allegations of misconduct by a home improvement contractor, the cause of action alleging negligent and intentional infliction of mental disturbance must be dismissed in the absence of any proof that plaintiff suffers from any definite physical symptoms purporting to indicate any mental injury caused by defendants' conduct.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner wife filed a supplemental petition, alleging that respondent husband failed to obey a modified order of protection. At the dispositional phase of the supplemental proceeding brought under N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 846, the court civilly committed the husband to two terms of incarceration, for six months and four months to run consecutively. The husband filed a motion, seeking reargument of the dispositional order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband argued that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act art. 8 did not authorize imposition of consecutive commitments. He cited a recent decision of the Third Department, which stated that in its view the statute, on its face, prohibited consecutive commitments. The court found that the holding, in a practical sense, constituted a judicial fiat that regardless of the number of separate willful violations committed by a respondent under an extant order of protection, the respondent risked civil commitment under Family Court auspices for only up to six months. The court declared that study of the legislative history underlying article 8 and the plain language of the statute as well as the public policy imbued therein prompted the conclusion that the appellate court in the recent decision engaged in judicial legislation. The court concluded that it was not bound by the holding. The court found that the grant of authority in N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect;&sect; 846 and 846-a implicitly invoked the power to make such commitments run concurrently or consecutively where appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the husband's motion seeking reargument of the dispositional order.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Order of Protection - Imposition of Consecutive Commitments Exceeding Six Months for Distinct Violations Pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 846-a, a guilty respondent may be committed to jail for a term not to exceed six months for each separate failure to obey an order of protection, and such commitments may run concurrently or consecutively.  Moreover, two individual contempts committed with respect to one order of protection constitute separate offenses for Sixth Amendment purposes and, therefore, the imposition of consecutive commitments for those contempts in excess of a total period of six months does not invoke jury trial relief applicable where the potential sentence for a criminal offense exceeds six months' imprisonment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dating service wanted to bring its operations to New York, but brought this action to determine if the controlling statute would be applicable to its operations. The court rejected the dating service's assertion that because they did not actually do the &quot;matching&quot; of the people, they should not be subject to the statute. The court found that the statute applied to not only those who did the matching, but also agencies (such as the dating service) that made available the means for persons to do their own matching. The court concluded that the statute therefore would apply to any operations that the dating service set up in the state. The court concluded that the price restrictions in the statute were constitutional because the legislature was operating within the bounds of their police power when they sought to guard against abuse in a limited manner as a matter of public policy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Declaratory Judgments - When Remedy Appropriate - Declaration That Business Not Engaged in Regulated Conduct - Statute Regulating Social Referral Services Plaintiff, a videotape dating service planning to commence operations in New York, may maintain a declaratory judgment action pursuant to CPLR 3001 seeking to obtain a declaration that it does not engage in &quot;social referral services&quot; so as to subject it to regulation under General Business Law &sect; 394-c.  Plaintiff is not attempting to obtain an advisory opinion. Rather, plaintiff should not be required to expend substantial funds, enter into contracts, acquire facilities, hire employees and do advertising before knowing whether it must conform its activities to a regulatory statute, which it challenges both as to scope and validity.  When, as here, there is a genuine controversy as to disputed relations, a declaratory judgment as to future obligations, which would enable parties to avoid loss and injury, is appropriate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer Protection - Social Referral Services - Regulation of Videotape Dating Service Plaintiff, a videotape dating service planning to commence operations in New York, engages in &quot;social referral services&quot; and would thus be subject to regulation under General Business Law &sect; 394-c, which covers any service for a fee &quot;providing matching of members of the opposite sex, by use of computer or any other means, for the purposes of dating and general social contact&quot;.  The scope of the statute is not limited to service agencies which actively match individuals, but encompasses those agencies, such as plaintiff, which make available the means for persons to do their own matching. Plaintiff is acting more than a mere computer &quot;dater bank&quot; when it makes the matching of members available by use of its technological facilities.  Furthermore, the adoption by the Legislature of the language &quot;any other means&quot; contemplated that matching could be made by techniques or technologies which were unknown at the time of the statute's enactment in 1971.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer Protection - Social Referral Services - Validity of Regulatory Statute&nbsp;General Business Law &sect; 394-c, which subjects to regulation any &quot;social referral service&quot; which, for a fee, provides &quot;matching of members of the opposite sex, by use of computer or any other means, for the purposes of dating and general social contact&quot;, is a constitutional exercise of the State's police power to prevent fraudulent and unscrupulous services.  In addition, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague or ambiguous.  The statutory language conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.  Furthermore, the statutory $ 250 maximum fee limitation does not constitute unconstitutional price control. As long as the Legislature has chosen a limited degree of regulation as a matter of public policy to guard against abuse and exorbitance, the courts may approve legislative price regulation as a legitimate exercise of the police power. Accordingly, plaintiff, a videotape dating service planning to commence operations in New York, would be subject to regulation under the statute.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother challenged an order from the hearing examiner (New York), which declared that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 545(1) was unconstitutional and held that respondent father did not owe child support from the date for which the mother's eligibility for public assistance was first effective and reduced the father's child support obligation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was held by the court to be the father of the mother's child and the matter was referred to a hearing examiner for a hearing on support. The hearing examiner denied awarding child support retroactive to the date that the child first received public assistance, as was required by N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 545(1). She held that the statute was unconstitutional in that it permitted child support to be awarded prior to the filing of the petition if the child was in receipt of public assistance, and that it denied equal protection to children who did not receive public assistance. On appeal, the court reversed. The statute involved neither a suspect classification nor a fundamental interest. Children were not treated differently. The child support rights were assigned to the local commissioner if public assistance had been received. The statute did not involve consequences that might be severe or damage that was irreparable. The conclusion of unconstitutionality was not inescapable. The statute was not clearly and unequivocally violative of the constitution and arguments could be advanced to support the enactment's rationality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the hearing examiner's decision as to the constitutionality of the statute and modified the determination by requiring child support to be retroactive to the last date that the mother's eligibility for public assistance was effective prior to the filing of the paternity petition against the father.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Hearing Examiners - Power to Determine Constitutionality of Statute - Support Order in Paternity Proceeding Involving Child Receiving Public Assistance In a paternity proceeding involving a child receiving public assistance, the Hearing Examiner erred in declaring unconstitutional, as violative of equal protection, the provision of Family Court Act &sect; 545 (1), which mandates that where a child is in receipt of public assistance, child support be awarded retroactively to the &quot;earlier of the date of the application for an order of filiation&quot;, or the date for which the child's &quot;eligibility for public assistance was effective&quot;.  While a Hearing Examiner may, in certain limited circumstances, enter a declaration of unconstitutionality, the Hearing Examiner herein erred in entering such a declaration based only upon the assertion of unconstitutionality made by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">pro se</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> respondent without establishing an adequate record or notifying the Attorney-General of the proceeding as required by CPLR 1012 (b).  Hearing Examiners and courts of inferior jurisdiction should be very circumspect before making a determination that a statute is unconstitutional.  The statute herein is not clearly and unequivocally unconstitutional.  In the absence of a complete review of the statutory framework, it cannot be said that the challenged classification lacks a rational basis and bears no reasonable relationship to some legitimate legislative objective. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children Born out of Wedlock - Paternity Proceeding - Retroactive Support Order Where Child is Receiving Public Assistance Pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 545 (1), which, in a paternity proceeding involving a child receiving public assistance, requires the court to order support retroactively to the date the child's &quot;eligibility for public assistance was effective&quot;, support should only be awarded retroactively to the date for which the eligibility for the public assistance the child is then receiving was effective and should not include prior periods of public assistance that may have occurred many years before.  Accordingly, where petitioner first went on public assistance in 1984 and went on and off public assistance several times thereafter, with her last application being from September 18, 1991 to January 29, 1993, the child support order in this paternity proceeding will be retroactive only to September 18, 1991, which was the last date that petitioner's eligibility for public assistance was effective prior to the filing of the paternity petition on February 13, 1992.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, city and school boards, filed an action against defendant State, seeking a judgment declaring the method for distributing education funds to be unconstitutional and requesting an injunction. The State filed a motion to dismiss the complaints and challenged the legal sufficiency of the pleadings filed by the city and the school boards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State asserted that the city and the school boards lacked the capacity to bring this action either in their own right or on behalf of other individuals such as schoolchildren. The court noted that the education article of N.Y. Const., art. XI, &sect; 1 was intended to assure only a sound basic education as opposed to a state-wide equality of all public educational facilities and services. The court, thus, concluded that the portion of the complaint, which asserted that the State had not adopted a systematic method for financing education so as to meet the state-wide minimum standards, could possibly warrant judicial interference in the school financing system. The court also determined that the complaints filed by the city and the school boards did not set forth a requisite complaint of intentional discrimination, and thus, application of a rational basis standard mandated dismissal of that portion of the complaints. The court also concluded that a financing system, which was discriminatory in effect albeit not in intent, may have violated civil rights recognized by the N.Y.C.P.L.R. 291(2).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Standing of Municipality and School Boards to Challenge State's Public School Financing System The City of New York and various City Community School Board Districts lack standing to challenge the State's public school financing scheme as violative of equal protection and the education article of the State Constitution (NY Const, art XI, &sect; 1) since they have failed to demonstrate any exception to the general rule that municipalities and school boards, as political subdivisions created by the State, lack the substantive right to challenge the constitutionality of acts of the State Legislature.  The municipal plaintiffs have not demonstrated that any State action would require them to violate a constitutional proscription nor do their claims for additional State school funding create proprietary rights under the home rule article of the Constitution (NY Const, art IX) such as would enable them to sue the State.  In addition, plaintiffs also lack the capacity to assert the constitutional and statutory claims on behalf of school children who reside within the City.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Constitutionality of Public School Financing System under Education Article - Adherence to Minimum Educational Standards Plaintiffs' challenge to the State's public school financing scheme as violative of the education article of the State Constitution (NY Const, art XI, &sect; 1) states a viable cause of action to the extent that the complaint alleges that education has fallen below the State-wide minimum standard of educational quality and quantity fixed by the Board of Regents because of a &quot;gross and glaring inadequacy&quot; in funding. The education article requires the State to provide public school students with a sound basic education, and the provision of a sound basic education must be equated with adherence to minimum educational standards approved by the Board of Regents.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Constitutionality of Public School Financing System - Equal Protection Heightened Scrutiny Analysis Not Applicable In view of the holding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Board of Educ. v Nyquist</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (57 NY2d 27) that the State's public school financing scheme does not violate equal protection under the rational basis standard despite disparities in per pupil expenditures caused by differences in the value of assessable property among school districts, plaintiffs' challenge to the current financing system on similar equal protection grounds must be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. The standard of more careful scrutiny applicable when challenged State action results in intentional discrimination against a class of persons should not be applied to plaintiffs' equal protection claims in the absence of any allegation of intentional discrimination which would trigger a heightened scrutiny analysis.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Validity of Public School Financing System under Federal Civil Rights Act Plaintiffs' challenge to the State's public school financing scheme as violative of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC &sect; 2000d </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by creating and perpetuating a dual system which adversely affects the quality of education available to New York City's predominantly minority student body is dismissed for failure to state a cause of action absent a showing of deliberate discrimination.  However, plaintiffs state a cause of action to the extent that they allege violations of 34 CFR 100.3, which also prohibits discrimination based upon race, color or national origin but only requires a mere showing of discriminatory effect.  Liability under the regulation has been sufficiently pleaded based upon the allegation that a substantial number of students are being deprived of meaningful education on the ground of race, color or national origin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Constitutionality of Public School Financing System under Antidiscrimination Clause Plaintiffs' challenge to the State's public school financing scheme as violative of the constitutional proscription against discrimination in civil rights &quot;because of race, color, creed or religion&quot; (NY Const, art I, &sect; 11) states a viable cause of action in view of the statutory declaration of the &quot;opportunity to obtain education&quot; as a &quot;civil right&quot; (Executive Law &sect; 291 [2]).  A system which is discriminatory in effect may violate civil rights recognized by the statute.  Accordingly, plaintiffs' discrimination claim is viable without an allegation of discriminatory intent.  </SPAN></P>

The corporations argued that the Petroleum Business Tax was unconstitutional in that it violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution by discriminating against interstate commerce. The Commissioner argued that the tax was not a use tax, but a privilege tax. In granting the petition, the court held that the imposition by other states of a tax statute similar to &sect; 301 would have resulted in multiple taxation in situations involving consumers who purchased their fuel from an out-of-state source, which would have had a discriminatory effect against interstate commerce in that it would favor local, intrastate commerce by way of potentially lower intrastate fuel prices than fuel purchased interstate because one less tax would be involved.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action was filed on behalf of a proposed class of public assistance applicants and recipients of Home Relief, who had resided in the state of New York for less than six months.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services - Public Assistance - Home Relief - Unconstitutionality of Six-Month Durational Residency Requirement as Violative of State's Duty to Provide Aid to Needy The amendment to Social Services Law &sect; 158 (f) (L 1992, ch 41), which, effective until July 1, 1994, establishes a durational residency requirement for the Home Relief program, resulting in reduced benefits for needy persons who have been residents of the State for six months or less and have come from States without comparable public assistance benefits, is unconstitutional as violative of the State's constitutional duty to aid the needy (NY Const, art XVII, &sect; 1) since it creates a classification for purposes of Home Relief benefits, residency for a period of six months, that is unrelated in any way to the determination of need.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services - Public Assistance - Home Relief - Unconstitutionality of Six-Month Durational Residency Requirement as Violative of State Equal Protection The amendment to Social Services Law &sect; 158 (f) (L 1992, ch 41), which, effective until July 1, 1994, establishes a durational residency requirement for the Home Relief program, resulting in reduced benefits for needy persons who have been residents of the State for six months or less and have come from States without comparable public assistance benefits, is unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection requirements of NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 11.  Although the State has a legitimate interest in reducing the public assistance caseload, as well as reducing the cost of the Home Relief program, the accomplishment of such result by arbitrarily denying full benefits to one class of persons, which are available to all other longer term residents, cannot be justified as rationally related to a legitimate State interest.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services - Public Assistance - Home Relief - Unconstitutionality of Six-Month Durational Residency Requirement as Violative of Federal Equal Protection and Right to Travel The amendment to Social Services Law &sect; 158 (f) (L 1992, ch 41), which, effective until July 1, 1994, establishes a durational residency requirement for the Home Relief program, resulting in reduced benefits for needy persons who have been residents for six months or less and have come from States without comparable public assistance benefits, is unconstitutional as violative of the right to travel and equal protection, as guaranteed by the United States Constitution.  The right to travel is violated by laws deterring migration into a State, or by statutes which seek to penalize the exercise of the right to travel. A statute which, as here, creates a classification which touches on the fundamental right of interstate movement, must be judged by the stricter constitutional standard of whether it promotes a compelling State interest; the conservation of the taxpayers' purse is not a sufficient State interest to sustain a durational residency requirement. In any event, the classification created by the statute does not bear a rational relationship to a legitimate State interest for equal protection purposes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services - Public Assistance - Home Relief - Unconstitutionality of Six-Month Durational Residency Requirement - Constitutionality of Lack of Notice of Residency Requirement The amendment to Social Services Law &sect; 158 (f) (L 1992, ch 41), which, effective until July 1, 1994, establishes a durational residency requirement for the Home Relief program, resulting in reduced benefits for needy persons who have been residents for six months or less and have come from States without comparable public assistance benefits, is unconstitutional.  However, respondents' administrative procedures in failing to provide petitioners with notice of reduced benefits did not constitute a violation of petitioners' due process rights.  The initial approval of an application for public assistance, notwithstanding the fact that the grant represents a reduced amount as compared to other residents, must be distinguished from the reduction or termination of benefits after a receipt thereof for a period of time.  In any event, one year after the enactment of the law, the local Departments of Social Services were instructed by the State Department of Social Services to provide applicants with notice of the residency limitation at the time of requesting Home Relief benefits.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actions - Class Actions - Denial of Class Action Certification in Action to Declare Unconstitutional Six-Month Durational Residency Requirement for Home Relief Benefits Although petitioners, who were granted reduced Home Relief benefits pursuant to the six-month durational residency requirement established by the amendment to Social Services Law &sect; 158 (f) (L 1992, ch 41), are granted judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional and are entitled to a restoration of benefits, their application for class action certification pursuant to CPLR 901 (a) is denied in view of the statute's July 1, 1994 expiration date and the fact that the parties are unable to demonstrate the number of persons who have been adversely affected by the durational residency requirement, for purposes of the Home Relief program.  In addition, the State has represented that the Department of Social Services would adhere to the doctrine of stare decisis in this case.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies contended that exclusive jurisdiction over the seizure cases lied in the federal courts because New York had no jurisdiction to enforce its tax laws with respect to Indian commerce on an Indian reservation. The court held that despite state law having been used as a standard of measurement to determine whether introduction of alcohol into Indian country was lawful, the enforcement mechanisms provided for in federal law respecting alcohol on Indian reservations were exclusively a federal concern, and the federal courts had exclusive jurisdiction over such seizures. The court held that Congress had preempted the field of regulating trade with Indians on reservations and had left no room for the application of supplementary state tax laws that imposed additional burdens. The court held that the state's seizure and failure to promptly return the liquor upon learning the importer's identity as an Indian trader constituted a burden on Indian traders which was impermissible. The court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, holding that the burdens imposed by the tax statutes were significant and were, accordingly, preempted by federal law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Federal Preemption - Indian Trader Statutes - State Registration Requirements for Distributors of Alcoholic Beverages New York's taxing scheme under Tax Law articles 18 and 37, to the extent that it imposes on the Indian trader an elaborate recordation system for distributors (Tax Law &sect; 421) to insure the collection of State taxes upon liquor bound for an Indian reservation and authorizes the seizure and forfeiture of alcoholic beverages and the vehicles carrying such beverages when the alcoholic beverages are imported into the State by an unregistered distributor, without distinguishing Indian traders (Tax Law &sect; 1845), places an impermissibly &quot;significant&quot; burden on Indian trade and is thus preempted by the Federal Indian Trader statutes (25 USC &sect; 261 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While, under Federal law, State law may be used as a standard of measurement to determine whether introduction of alcohol into Indian country is lawful (18 USC &sect; 1161), the enforcement mechanisms as provided for in Federal law respecting alcohol on Indian reservations (18 USC &sect;&sect; 1154, 1156) are exclusively a Federal concern, and the Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over such seizures. Furthermore, since the sale of liquor on an Indian reservation to an Indian is exempt from sales and excise taxes, a similar exemption for the distributor recordation and registration requirements is applicable to defendants herein.  Accordingly, New York has no subject matter jurisdiction to maintain a forfeiture action arising from the seizure of liquor being transported by an unregistered Indian trader to an Indian reservation. </SPAN></P>

Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 53.1(s). The court granted plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint and found that plaintiff made a sufficient showing, based upon the SLA's official records to prove the nonexistence of appropriate statutory authority for the rule in issue. The court declared defendant's six-foot rule was null and void, for want of statutory authority to promulgate it and the court enjoined defendant from enforcing the rule. The court concluded that a declaratory judgment action did not lie on the issue of whether the use of the liquid latex bras rendered plaintiff's premises disorderly because plaintiff specifically denied that its activities were within the proscribed parameters of the rule and plaintiff was required to first exhaust its administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

The amended and supplemental complaint merely sets forth additional theories of recovery based upon the same set of facts as originally pleaded.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intoxicating Liquors - Licenses - Topless Dancing - Validity of Proximity Rule Banning Topless Dancing within Six Feet of Bar Patrons A rule of the State Liquor Authority (SLA) banning topless dancers from performing within six feet of bar patrons (9 NYCRR 53.1 [s]) regardless of how &quot;orderly&quot; the licensed premises may otherwise be is null and void for want of statutory authority to promulgate it.  Topless dancing is a constitutionally protected form of expression that cannot be &quot;categorically&quot; banned in the absence of evidence that such a ban is sufficiently functionally related to the exercise of the State's police power as to overcome the State constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression. Plaintiff, a cabaret operator, has made a sufficient showing, based upon official records maintained and produced by the SLA, that there is no appropriate statutory authority to support such a categorical, &quot;no-fault&quot; proximity rule.  However, to the extent that plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that its use of liquid applied latex bras does not render the premises &quot;disorderly&quot;, the complaint is dismissed as premature since plaintiff must first exhaust its administrative remedies.  </SPAN></P>

The plaintiffs claimed that the appropriations bill was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers doctrine, lacked specificity, and violated the prohibition against giving state money private individuals or organizations. The court found that the appropriations bill did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers because nothing in the bill provided that the legislature would have the power to determine how the money provided for would be spent. The mere fact that, in the spirit of comity, the legislature was allowed input into how the money was spent did not make the bill illegal. The court also found that providing more detail in how the money would be spent would have been impracticable given the hundreds of programs involved. Finally, the court found that the grant of public funds to the private entities was not unconstitutional because the funds were granted for a public purpose rather than a private purpose.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Separation of Powers - Lump-Sum Appropriations Bill - Effect of Provision Permitting Legislative Recommendations as to Expenditure </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The 1994 Aid to Localities Budget, which provides for a $ 48 million lump-sum member-item appropriation, does not violate the New York Constitution's separation of powers doctrine merely because the bill permits the Legislature to recommend to the executive how the funds being appropriated should be spent. The bill does not contain a specific legislative direction providing that the Legislature has the power to segregate (itemize) the lump-sum appropriation. In fact, nothing in the legislation permits the Legislature to determine how the $ 48 million should be spent. Moreover, not only is there no delegation of power to the Legislature, the bill contains an affirmative grant of power to the executive to determine how the $ 48 million should be awarded.  The executive may choose to give effect to legislative recommendation, but the extent to which the legislative recommendations are followed is in the discretion of the executive.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legislature - Lump-Sum Appropriations Bill - What Constitutes Itemization </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The 1994 Aid to Localities Budget, which provides for a $ 48 million lump-sum member-item appropriation, does not violate New York Constitution, article VII, &sect; 4, which requires that items of appropriation added by the Legislature &quot;refer each to a single object or purpose&quot;, since the appropriation is specifically for &quot;services and expenses or for contracts with municipalities and/or private not-for-profit community agencies&quot;.  While &quot;itemization&quot; is required in budget bills, there is no specific standard for such itemization and it is not a proper function of the courts to police the degree of itemization necessary.  Here, the degree of itemization is that which would enable the Governor to perform his complementary review function of exercising a line-item veto.  In addition, the appropriation involved makes it impracticable and unworkable for the Legislature to provide further detail.  Finally, a specific level of detail in budget bills cannot be required, not only because of the practical difficulty of articulating such a standard to apply to the variety of appropriations in the budget, but also because the necessary level of detail is self-determined through the implementation of the constitutional budget process. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Gift of Public Funds - Lump-Sum Appropriations Bill - Public Purpose </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The 1994 Aid to Localities Budget, which provides for a $ 48 million lump-sum member-item appropriation, does not violate either New York Constitution, article VII, &sect; 8 or article VIII, &sect; 1 which prohibit (1) the gift or loan of State credit or money to private entities for private purposes, and (2) the gift or loan of money or property of a municipality or school district to private entities for private purposes, respectively.  Here, the items appropriated to the Department of Economic Development were for a public purpose because economic underdevelopment and stagnation are threats to the public.  The items appropriated to the Division for Youth and to the Natural Heritage Trust are for a public purpose because the expenditure of public money for recreation, entertainment, amusement, education and enlightenment of the public is for a public benefit and purpose.  The appropriation to the Division of Housing and Community Renewal is valid because urban redevelopment programs are for a public purpose. Finally, those appropriations for services and expenses or for contracts with municipalities and/or private, not-for-profit community agencies are valid because the agencies provide a variety of programs to the public.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Necessary Parties - Recipients of Allegedly Unconstitutional Budget Bill Appropriations </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiffs' complaint challenging, on constitutional grounds, the 1994 Aid to Localities Budget, which provides for a $ 48 million lump-sum member-item appropriation, is dismissed for failure to join, as necessary parties, identified recipients of the alleged unconstitutional appropriations. These entities have at least a colorable claim to the appropriations; thus they have a right to be heard before the court deprives them of any claim they may have to funds appropriated. Notice and the opportunity to be heard are required before one's rights may be adversely affected.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecutor filed a motion to enhance defendant's sentence for first degree robbery for defendant's perjured testimony during the jury trial. Defendant opposed the motion on the basis that defendant had testified truthfully and that enhancement violated defendant's state constitutional guarantees of due process and the right to testify on his own behalf.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted to some guilty conduct during his grand jury testimony. However, at trial, defendant denied that testimony and claimed he was elsewhere when the robbery occurred. Defendant was convicted by the jury for first degree robbery. The prosecution filed a motion to enhance defendant's sentence based on perjury. The court granted the enhancement. The court found that constitutional challenges to enhancement were without merit. The enhancement for perjured trial testimony did not impermissibly chill defendant's exercise of the right to testify on his own behalf, because there was no right to perjured testimony. Defendant's due process rights were not violated when perjury was used to enhance the sentence, even though it was not separately charged and tried, because the perjury occurred in front of the court, involved basic adjudicative facts, the perjury was material to the issues, and the perjury was only one factor considered in light of the sentencing goals. The court found that defendant's case was appropriate for the enhancement because there was overwhelming evidence of defendant's pattern of perjury, slander, and manipulation, which made rehabilitation unlikely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the prosecutor's motion to enhance defendant's first degree robbery sentence and sentenced defendant to an indeterminate sentence of 4 to 12 years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Imposition of Enhanced Sentence Based upon Defendant's Trial Perjury A sentencing Judge is authorized to consider a defendant's trial perjury in enhancing a defendant's sentence under New York's indeterminate sentencing laws.  Sentence enhancement based on the defendant's trial perjury does not impermissibly chill the defendant's constitutional right to testify since the right to testify is not a license to commit perjury. Nor is sentence enhancement a denial of due process merely because the defendant was not formally charged and tried for the perjury. Due process is ensured by adherence to the specific standards set forth by the United States Supreme Court when a trial court considers a defendant's trial perjury in imposing sentence. Accordingly, in this case in which defendant was convicted of the knifepoint robbery of complainant's jacket, defendant's denial at trial of any involvement in the crime after he admitted before the Grand Jury that he and an accomplice forcibly took complainant's jacket, and his accusation under oath that his first assigned attorney suborned perjury by advising him to testify falsely before the Grand Jury in order to &quot;get probation&quot;, establishes a pattern of flagrant perjury in the proceedings against him so as to warrant the enhancement of his sentence from a term of 3 to 9 years which would have otherwise been imposed to a term of 4 to 12 years.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with disruption or disturbance of a religious service in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.21. Defendants argued that the charges were unconstitutional. The court found no violation of the establishment clause, because classification the violation as a class A misdemeanor was an attempt to protect individuals' rights of religious freedom. The law did not violate defendants' rights to freedom of religion, because they were free to express their beliefs; however, they could not intentionally interfere with the progress of a religious service. The law was not overbroad where the conduct prohibited was only proscribed when it was coupled with the intent to prevent the conduct of a religious service.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Disruption or Disturbance of Religious Service - Establishment Clause Defendants' motion to dismiss charges of disruption, or disturbance of a religious service (Penal Law &sect; 240.21) on the ground that the statute violates the Establishment Clause by designating the statute as a class A misdemeanor, while the disruption of a nonreligious assembly is designated in the Penal Law as a violation </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 240.20), is denied.  The Legislature may designate an offense a class A misdemeanor when the proscribed conduct interferes with a fundamental right.  Here the purpose of Penal Law &sect; 240.21 is not to establish any right; its purpose is to protect the rights of those individuals who choose to exercise their fundamental right of freedom of religion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Disruption or Disturbance of Religious Service - Freedom of Religion Defendants' motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument charging them with disruption, or disturbance of a religious service (Penal Law &sect; 240.21) on the grounds that, as applied, the statute is an unconstitutional infringement of their First Amendment right to freedom of religion is denied.  An individual may not exercise his or her own constitutional rights and in this process infringe on the constitutional rights of others.  Additionally, an individual may not exercise claimed First Amendment rights at any time or at any place.  Here, where it is acknowledged by defendants that their actions were intended as &quot;an attempt to prevent the sacrilege of a Mass&quot; and the complaint alleges considerable disruptive conduct by the defendants, including blocking the way of the priest and the deacon at the beginning of the service and shouting several things that did not constitute a prayer of any type at the priest, the conduct, if as alleged, infringed on the rights of those persons in attendance who were exercising their freedom of religion and who were participating in a Mass.  The challenged statute is not intended to punish the exercise of religion but rather it is intended to protect the rights of persons to exercise their own religious beliefs without impermissible interference.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Disruption or Disturbance of Religious Service - Overbreadth Defendants' motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument charging defendants with disruption, or disturbance of a religious service (Penal Law &sect; 240.21) on the ground that the statute is facially overbroad and therefore unconstitutional is denied.  A person is guilty of that offense if he or she makes unreasonable noise or disturbance while within 100 feet of a lawfully assembled religious service, with intent to cause annoyance or alarm or recklessly creating a risk thereof.  The statute is not meant to proscribe the conduct of an individual who is standing fewer than 100 feet from a religious service and whose conduct is not coupled with the requisite intent to disturb the service or recklessly creating a risk thereof.  Furthermore, the State has a justifiable interest in protecting the rights of those who wish to exercise their freedom of religion over the interest of those individuals who intend to infringe these First Amendment rights.  The language of the challenged statute, given its normal meaning, is not so broad that its sanctions might apply to conduct that is constitutionally protected.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Standing to Raise Overbreadth Claim Defendants charged with disruption, or disturbance of a religious service (Penal Law &sect; 240.21) have standing to raise an overbreadth claim even though their conduct allegedly occurred inside a church and, therefore, falls squarely within the hard core of the statute's proscriptions.  Under the overbreadth doctrine, a person may be permitted to litigate the rights of third parties, even though that individual's alleged actions do not necessarily fall under the scope of these arguments.  A person has standing to make an overbreadth challenge even though it might be constitutionally permissible to regulate that person's conduct under a more narrowly drawn and specified statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Aggravated Disorderly Conduct - Disruption or Disturbance of Religious Service - Dismissal in Furtherance of Justice Defendants' motion to dismiss a charge of disruption, or disturbance of a religious service (Penal Law &sect; 240.21) in the interest of justice, pursuant to CPL 170.40, is denied, where defendants allegedly chanted during the service and physically approached the priest and others participating in the Mass, as the defendants have failed to sustain the burden of showing factors which would compel the dismissal.  The court may dismiss in the interest of justice to allow justice to prevail over the strict letter of the law so as to prevent a miscarriage of justice, but the motion should not be granted unless the facts and circumstances are such that to deny relief would shock the conscience of the court.  Here, the actual harm that results from defendants' alleged actions is both tangible and intangible: tangible harm results from the halting or interruption of church services; and consequent harm, the disturbance of peaceful exercise of freedom of religion, is a serious disturbance of the rights of the worshippers. Therefore, a balance of the equities simply does not render unjust the continuance of this prosecution.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village enacted an ordinance that prohibited the use of metal sheets on the exterior of a premises in order to prevent or impede access into said premises. The property owner had erected steel gates before the enactment of the ordinance and in response to criminal activity on the property. The village filed suit to enforce the ordinance. The property owner filed a motion to dismiss, which the court granted. The court held that while the ordinance was designed to enhance the aesthetic character of the area, a permissible goal, it was unconstitutional because the village failed to show that the property owner's gate was a substantial offense to the eye or how the benefit of a proposed substituted security system would outweigh the monetary loss of property and business of the property owner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Police Power - Constitutionality of Aesthetics-Based Use Restriction as Applied to Existing Structure </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Village Code, which prohibits metal sheets on the exterior of premises to prevent or impede access into the premises, and which is designed to improve the aesthetics of storefronts under the guise of promoting the health, safety and welfare of Village residents, is unconstitutional as applied to defendant owner of a commercial building who, prior to enactment of the Code, erected steel security gates on the extension of its building in response to repeated incidents of vandalism and burglary.  Notwithstanding that aesthetics, in itself, constitutes a valid basis for the exercise of a municipality's police power just as safety does, such regulation which is enacted merely to enhance the aesthetics of a community, which is the obvious case here, generally does not provide the compelling reasons for implementation with respect to existing structures or uses.  A property owner has the right to use his property in a certain fashion and exercise reasonable means to protect and secure that property.  A denial of that right solely on aesthetic grounds should be based upon a showing that the offense to the eye is substantial and has a material effect on the community or district pattern.  The Village has not met its burden in this regard.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a company that was awarded city contracts and various persons associated with the company, filed a motion in a trial court (New York) for discovery and inspection of the grand jury minutes that supported the indictments against them, and for dismissal of the indictment. The defendants were indicted for violations of the penal code regarding the wages paid and professional supervision required in performing certain city contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city awarded contracts to defendants that required a certain wage rate to be paid and professional supervision of the work. The indictment generally alleged that the defendants never intended to comply with the wage and supervision requirements. The defendants sought dismissal of the indictment. The court held that evidence presented to the grand jury was: (1) sufficient to show a scheme to defraud or a pattern of behavior calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension; (2) insufficient regarding larceny and conspiracy; (3) sufficient regarding the filing of false wage and professional supervision certifications; (4) sufficient regarding the perjury charge; and (5) sufficient to establish that the wage certifications were materially false and intended to deceive the city. The court held that the city was not required to show pecuniary loss, that the prevailing wage rate statutes were not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, that the state's labor laws did not provide the exclusive criminal penalties for conduct within their ambit, and that the prosecution had adequately responded to the defendants' discovery requests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss the indictment. The court denied the motion to discover and inspect the grand jury minutes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Scheme to Defraud - Municipal Contractor's Failure to Pay Workers Prevailing Hourly Wage </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants, the contracting officers in a company awarded municipal water meter installation contracts requiring the contractor to pay its workers the prevailing hourly wage in accordance with Labor Law &sect; 220, may properly be prosecuted for the crime of scheme to defraud in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 190.65) for having allegedly cheated their meter installers by advertising a high hourly wage and then paying them at the lower piecework rate.  The definition of property for purposes of the crime of scheme to defraud is broad enough to encompass the services provided by the installers. Furthermore, sufficient evidence was presented to the Grand Jury to demonstrate that the installers were deceived by defendants' words and conduct, including alleged misleading advertisements, and misstatements to trainees and installers. The sum total of defendants' conduct constitutes a pattern of behavior calculated to deceive persons of ordinary prudence and comprehension.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Larceny - Larceny by False Promise - Theft of Municipal Contract </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendants, the contracting officers in a company awarded municipal water meter installation contracts, cannot be prosecuted under Penal Law &sect; 155.05 (2) (d) for having stolen the government contracts they entered into because of allegedly false promises made during the contract formation process concerning the company's intention to comply with the contracts' prevailing wage and preplumbing master plumber requirements since the contracts herein cannot be deemed property capable of being stolen within the meaning of the larceny statute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 155.00 [1]).  The parties to a contract exist in a commercial form of symbiotic relationship.  The &quot;contract&quot; does not exist independent of that relationship.  Viewed in this context, a party to a contract, or in the case of a corporate entity, as here, its contracting officers, cannot steal that contract.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Larceny - Larceny by False Pretense - No Criminal Liability for Municipal Contractor's Contractual Misrepresentations </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendants, the contracting officers in a company awarded municipal water meter installation contracts, cannot be prosecuted for larceny by false pretense (Penal Law &sect; 155.05 [2] [a]) for having accepted full payment under the contracts despite having made misrepresentations that the company had paid its meter installers the prevailing hourly wage and that preplumbing work had been performed under the supervision of a licensed master plumber as required by the contracts.  Charging a contractor with stealing the entire contract price when the contractor did not perform strictly in accordance with the methodology agreed upon but delivered the essence of the performance at a price which is in no way inflated would constitute a dangerous expansion of the larceny statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Offering False Instrument for Filing - False Certifications Regarding Compliance with Prevailing Wage and Master Plumber Requirements in Municipal Contract - Showing of Municipality's Pecuniary Loss Not Required </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendants, the contracting officers in a company awarded municipal water meter installation contracts, may be prosecuted for multiple counts of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree for having submitted false certifications that the company had complied with the contracts' prevailing hourly wage requirement (Labor Law &sect;&sect; 220, 220-a) and the requirement that all preplumbing work would be supervised by a licensed master plumber since sufficient testimony of installers and team leaders was presented to the Grand Jury to demonstrate that employees were not paid the prevailing wage and that the master plumber simply lent the use of his seal while having no other involvement, directly or indirectly, in the preplumbing work.  Furthermore, the statute only requires that legitimate government interests and processes were frustrated by defendants' false filings and does not require proof that the City suffered any pecuniary loss.  The City's reason for requiring such filings was to ensure its interest in having the prevailing wage paid and proper plumbing supervision, and the filings frustrated such government interests.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Perjury - False Sworn Certificates Regarding Compliance with Prevailing Wage Requirement in Municipal Contract - No Requirement That Notary Public Testify before Grand Jury </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Defendants, the contracting officers in a company awarded municipal water meter installation contracts, may be prosecuted for perjury for having submitted false sworn certificates that the company had complied with the contracts' prevailing hourly wage requirement (Labor Law &sect;&sect; 220, 220-a) since the evidence before the Grand Jury established that the piecework payments made to the meter installers were substantially less than the prevailing hourly wages defendants were required to pay.  Furthermore, it was not necessary that the notary public before whom the certificates were sworn has testified before the Grand Jury since a jurat and signature of the notary are prima facie evidence that the oath was administered.  Lastly, the evidence before the Grand Jury was sufficient to establish that the certificates were materially false and were intended to deceive the City of New York.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Scheme to Defraud - Municipal Contractor's Failure to Pay Workers Prevailing Hourly Wage - Exclusivity of Labor Law Provisions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Defendants, the contracting officers in a company awarded municipal water meter installation contracts requiring the contractor to pay its workers the prevailing hourly wage in accordance with Labor Law &sect; 220, may properly be prosecuted for the crime of scheme to defraud in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 190.65) for having allegedly cheated their meter installers by advertising a high hourly wage and then paying them at the lower piecework rate.  The criminal penalties available under the prevailing wage statute are not the exclusive remedy available for failure to pay the prevailing wage in the absence of any specific evidence of legislative intent to have the Labor Law provide the exclusive criminal penalties for conduct within its ambit.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Federal Preemption - Criminal Prosecution Predicated upon Municipal Contractor's Failure to Pay Workers Prevailing Hourly Wage Not Preempted by ERISA </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The criminal prosecution of defendants, the contracting officers in a company awarded municipal water meter installation contracts, for Penal Law violations predicated upon the failure to pay workers the prevailing hourly wage in accordance with Labor Law &sect; 220 as required by the contracts is not preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) (29 USC &sect; 1001 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ERISA only preempts those State laws in the area in which it legislates and, moreover, preemption does not apply, as here, to &quot;any generally applicable criminal law of a State&quot; (29 USC &sect; 1144 [b] [4]).  The fact that misrepresentations as to compliance with Labor Law &sect; 220 may form part of the predicate for Penal Law violations cannot convert those criminal statutes into prohibited laws aimed specifically at employee benefit plans.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Prevailing Wage Statute - Criminal Prosecution Predicated upon Municipal Contractor's Failure to Pay Workers Prevailing Hourly Wage Not Barred </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The criminal prosecution of defendants, the contracting officers in a company awarded municipal water meter installation contracts, predicated upon the failure to pay workers the prevailing hourly wage in accordance with Labor Law &sect; 220 as required by the contracts, is not barred because of the alleged unconstitutionality of the prevailing wage statute.  The prevailing wage statute does not unconstitutionally delegate the legislative process to private parties by requiring the Comptroller, without discretion, to select prevailing wages from collective bargaining agreements.  Rather, the statute grants the Comptroller discretion to select the rates and, in this case, the Comptroller did make findings and set the rates.  Moreover, there is no allegation of collusive negotiation of collective bargaining agreements.  Lastly, the statute's definition of &quot;locality&quot; is not impermissibly vague.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grand Jury - Defective Proceeding - Failure to Present Exculpatory Evidence - Fair Presentation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. In the criminal prosecution of defendants, the contracting officers in a company awarded municipal water meter installation, contracts, predicated upon the failure to pay workers the prevailing hourly wage in accordance with Labor Law &sect; 220 as required by the contracts, the People were not obligated to present allegedly exculpatory evidence to the Grand Jury that certain employees received payment in excess of the prevailing wage. The People do not have the same obligations at the Grand Jury phase as they have at the trial phase.  In this case, a reading of the Grand Jury minutes indicates that the presentation was fair and proper and that there was sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case.  Defendants have presented nothing but speculation to support their claims of irregularities.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between petitioner employee's union and respondent employer, the employee challenged his dismissal for testing positive for a prescription medication to the arbitration board (board). The board upheld the termination because the employee failed to inform his employer about the prescription and it was his second offense. The employee sought vacatur of the arbitration award under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7511.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that the employer, a city transit authority, was guilty of misconduct and that the award violated public policy. The employer claimed the employee lacked standing to challenge the award and that he waived his objections to the first drug test by not timely challenging it. The court held that the test results could not be considered by the board because the first test was not based upon individualized suspicion and was an unreasonable search in violation of the New York and Federal Constitutions, and the second drug test was fruit of the poisonous tree. The employee was a party for the purposes of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7511 and had standing to challenge the award because the agreement provided that he could represent himself through all the grievance steps and personally appeal to the next step and to arbitration. The union did not waive the employee's constitutional rights when it agreed to random drug testing because the unconstitutional testing violated the state's strong public policy. The court held that, without the first blood test, dismissal was excessively harsh by the board's own standards, and the award was both contrary to public policy and irrational.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the employee's petition and vacated the arbitration award on the grounds that it was irrational and violative of a strong public policy. The court ordered reinstatement of the employee to the position he held prior to termination and back pay from the date of termination until reinstatement minus any unemployment benefits and earnings accrued during that period.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to &sect; 50-e, the driver submitted a claim notice to the city's comptroller. The city's comptroller notified the driver that the matter was under investigation. The city comptroller failed to act on the claim. The driver initiated a personal injury action against the city health corporation. The city health corporation the matter for seven months. The city health corporation then filed a motion to dismiss claiming that the driver gave the claim notice to the wrong agency.

Procedural requirements such as the notice of claim provisions of General Municipal Law &sect; 50-e need not be strictly applied in the Small Claims Court.  In addition, since the defendant repeatedly adjourned this case for seven months, which was approximately 14 months after the accident, the defendant should be estopped from asserting the lack of a timely notice of claim upon it because its own acts delayed the proceeding to such an extent that the plaintiff was beyond the statutory time within which to move to extend the time to file a late notice of claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A patient died while giving birth, and her administrator filed a medical malpractice action against the hospital and the attending physician. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the administrator in finding that the hospital was 30 percent responsible and that the physician was 70 percent responsible, and the award was later reduced by the court. Then, pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to being sentenced upon his conviction for misdemeanor third degree assault, defendant asked court to declare N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;720.20 to be unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, because sentencing judge in superior court had authority to deny him youthful offender status, while a local criminal court judge would not have had that power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of felony assault and robbery. Defendant was convicted of third degree assault. Before sentencing, he moved to be mandatorily accorded youthful offender (Y.O.) status and asked court to find N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 720.20 to be unconstitutional. He alleged law was a violation of equal protection because he was eligible for Y.O. treatment but court could deny him that status because it had discretion to grant or deny youthful offender treatment, whereas a local criminal court would be required to treat him as a youthful offender. Court denied motion and found &sect; 720.20 to be constitutional because broader discretion afforded to superior court to deny youthful offender status was based on gravity of crime originally charged, and there was a rational basis to distinguish between a youth charged with a felony and one accused of a misdemeanor. It was rational to allow superior court judges, being aware of evidence, to weigh all reasonable sentencing options. Finally, the discretion did not grant prosecutors unlimited power to prevent mandatory adjudication of defendants as a Y.O. simply by deciding to level charges in a superior, rather than lower court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Statute was deemed constitutional, and defendant's motion to be mandatorily adjudicated as a youthful offender (Y.O.) was denied because superior court could deny Y.O. treatment based upon gravity of crimes defendant was originally charged with, and there was a rational basis for making distinctions between youths charged with felonies and those charged with misdemeanors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Infants - Youthful Offenders - Mandatory Treatment </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 720.20 (1) does not violate defendant's equal protection guarantees by vesting only a superior court with discretion to grant or deny youthful offender treatment where defendant, an eligible youth charged with a felony, and convicted by a County Court jury of a misdemeanor, was not given mandatorily accorded youthful offender status.  CPL 720.20 (1) mandates that an eligible defendant must receive youthful offender treatment for a maiden misdemeanor conviction secured in a local criminal court.  Yet, if a conviction is obtained in a County Court, a Judge there is vested with discretion to deny youthful offender status.  This difference in treatment has a rational basis in that the statutory classification, which gives superior courts broader discretion than lower courts to deny youthful offender status, is based on the gravity of the crime originally charged. This is especially evident here where the original evidence supported multiple felony charges, charges properly heard in a superior court only.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife and defendant husband executed a separation agreement which was incorporated into a judgment of divorce but was not merged into it.

The wife moved to have the modification agreement incorporated in the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife argued that to deny her the requested relief would permit her to enforce the original divorce judgment, including those portions which were modified, according to their original form. The court found that the result did not follow. The modification agreement was a contract by which the wife explicitly agreed to limit her rights with respect to the matters dealt with; thus, by the terms of the new contract, the modification agreement, the wife is barred from enforcing the original judgment to the extent it was modified. The court held that the wife's remedy, to proceed on the modified terms as though this were a contract action, could deprive her of certain procedural benefits while also offering the husband fewer defenses to enforcement. The court concluded that the benefits to be obtained by either party were items to be negotiated when the parties entered into the modification agreement. At the insistence of one side, the court would not alter the modification agreement more than seven years after it was signed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where plaintiff wife and defendant husband executed a separation agreement which was incorporated but not merged into a judgment of divorce and the parties modified the agreement in certain regards including maintenance and child support, the plaintiff's motion to have the modification agreement incorporated into the divorce judgment is denied. A separation agreement that is incorporated but not merged with the divorce degree remains an independent contract and absent compelling circumstances, the court must give controlling effect to a separation agreement. Here, the language of the parties did not agree to a modification of the judgment. Moreover, terms of the separation agreement cannot be added or deleted under the guise of construction. Further, no modification of a judgment incorporating the terms of a separation agreement shall be made as to maintenance without a showing of extreme hardship (Domestic Relations Law &sect; 236 [B] [9] [b]) and plaintiff failed to offer any facts which would lead to a finding of extreme hardship. Finally, the standard for modifying a child support judgment is whether in the interests of the child, changed circumstances exist which warrant an increase. That standard has not been met.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, charged with refusing to treat a person in need of emergency medical treatment under N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2805-b(2)(b), falsifying business records in the first degree under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 175.10, and tampering with physical evidence under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged defendant with refusing to treat a person in need of emergency medical treatment under N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2805-b (2)(b), falsifying business records in the first degree under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 175.10, and tampering with physical evidence under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 215.40. Defendant sought dismissal of the Public Health Law charge on various constitutional grounds. The court denied the motion, holding N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2805-b (2)(b) was not unconstitutional. The court found that that the legislature intended by the statute in question, to impose strict liability on licensed medical practitioners with respect to the element of whether the person seeking emergency treatment was actually in need of such treatment. The court found that the statute met the Penal Law's minimum requirements for imposing criminal liability on individuals because it required the performance by a person of conduct which included a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act which he is physically capable of performing under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 15.10.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion for dismissal of a charge against him under a public health law as the law in question was constitutional.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Strict Liability Offenses - Refusal of Medical Practitioner to Treat Emergency Patient Public Health Law &sect; 2805-b (2) (b), which provides that any licensed medical practitioner who refuses to treat a person arriving at a general hospital to receive emergency medical treatment who is in need of such treatment shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, imposes strict liability on licensed medical practitioners to the extent that they may be culpable without having actual knowledge that the person they refused to treat was in need of emergency medical treatment at the time they refused to treat them.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Public Health Law &sect; 2805-b (2) (b) - Vagueness Public Health Law &sect; 2805-b (2) (b), which provides that any licensed medical practitioner who refuses to treat a person arriving at a general hospital to receive emergency medical treatment who is in need of such treatment shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, is not unconstitutionally vague on the ground that the statute does not define the terms &quot;treat&quot; and &quot;emergency medical treatment&quot; or enunciate criteria as to how and by whom such concepts are to be developed.  &quot;Treat&quot; and &quot;emergency&quot; give sufficient notice because each is a term of general import and has a definite and ascertainable meaning intelligible to the average licensed medical practitioner without definition by the Legislature.  That licensed medical practitioners do not always agree on a proper course of treatment has no constitutional import, since the question the statute raises is whether or not a licensed medical practitioner refused to treat a person.  Moreover, the statute is reasonably read to require licensed medical practitioners to examine and diagnose persons seeking treatment.  While licensed medical practitioners sometimes differ on whether certain cases present &quot;emergency&quot; situations, when, as here, the general class of offenses to which the statute is directed is plainly within its terms, the statute will not be struck down as vague, even though marginal cases could be put where doubts may arise.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Public Health Law &sect; 2805-b (2) (b) - Vagueness - Malum In Se Conduct Public Health Law &sect; 2805-b (2) (b), which provides that any licensed medical practitioner who refuses to treat a person arriving at a general hospital to receive emergency medical treatment who is in need of such treatment shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, does not punish otherwise innocent conduct so as to require that the elements of the offense be spelled out in words even more explicitly in order to withstand a constitutional challenge for vagueness. The conduct proscibed may accurately be characterized as malum in se with regard to medical professionals since guilt does not consist entirely in violation of a legislative fiat, but rather a legislative determination to criminalize professionally improper conduct.  Moreover, there is a reasonable relationship between preventing unnecessary deaths or disabilities among persons seeking and in need of emergency medical treatment and prohibiting those directly responsible for rendering such care from refusing to treat them.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Public Health Law &sect; 2805-b (2) (b) - Overbreadth Public Health Law &sect; 2805-b (2) (b), which provides that any licensed medical practitioner who refuses to treat a person arriving at a general hospital to receive emergency medical treatment who is in need of such treatment shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, is not unconstitutionally overbroad or irrational.  The language regarding the breadth of paragraph (b)'s coverage could not be clearer.  A plain reading of the statute reveals that it applies to general hospitals, both private and public, and has no limitation based on where, at such hospital, a person arrives to seek treatment, whether it be at a designated &quot;emergency room&quot; or not.  Further, the proscriptions of paragraph (b) are rationally related to its purpose of preventing unnecessary deaths or disabilities among persons seeking and in need of emergency medical treatment and prohibiting licensed medical practitioners at general hospitals from refusing to treat them, whether or not such persons arrive at designated &quot;emergency&quot; rooms.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People sought to have defendant sentenced as a second felony offender following her guilty plea to the reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree on the ground that defendant had one prior felony drug conviction under indictment for which she had received an unconditional discharge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to a reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree. She had one prior felony drug conviction under a 1991 indictment for which she had received an unconditional discharge. The unconditional discharge was vacated because no reason had been set forth in the record, and defendant was resentenced to a probationary term. The People asked the court to sentence defendant as a second felony offender. Although they did not dispute the fact that the sentence under the 1991 indictment was illegal, they argued that the vacatur of the original sentence did not alter the fact that the first sentence resulted in a final conviction and that the resentence was deemed nunc pro tunc to the original sentencing date. Defendant asserted that the vacated sentence was a legal nullity and that she was not, in effect, sentenced on the 1991 indictment prior to the commission of this offense. The court held that because no valid legal sentence was imposed on defendant under the 1991 indictment before she committed the instant offense, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06 dictated that she did not qualify as a second felony offender.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Second Felony Offender - Effect of Vacatur of Prior Sentence - Cruel and Unusual Punishment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant may not be sentenced as a second felony offender where the sentence of unconditional discharge on her one prior felony drug conviction was vacated as illegal and she was resentenced to a probationary term subsequent to the second felony conviction. A defendant can be adjudicated a second felony offender only if the prior felony sentence was imposed before the commission of the subsequent felony (Penal Law &sect; 70.06 [1] [b] [ii]). A sentence which was illegally imposed and subsequently vacated is a nullity and can be given no legal effect. Since no valid legal sentence had been imposed on defendant before she committed the instant offense, she does not qualify as a second felony offender. Moreover, even if the prior conviction does constitute a predicate felony notwithstanding the resentence, treating defendant as a second felony offender would constitute cruel and unusual punishment and would be contrary to the legislative purpose of the predicate felony statutes under the facts and circumstances of his case in view of defendant's untreated drug addiction underlying her criminal acts and her late involvement with the criminal justice system.  </SPAN></P>

Fines must be based on convictions and not on the number of arrests. Moreover, it is the exclusive responsibility of the court to impose sentences and levy fines. Furthermore, while the spirit and intent of the statute was to have someone of parental authority request the return of the skateboard after it was confiscated for violation of the statute, the statute does not imply this, stating that &quot;a parent of the child ... shall come to the Village&quot;; therefore, this discriminates against children without parents.  Additionally, the confiscation or taking of any property without provision of a hearing is illegal unless the seized property is the object or instrumentality alleged to have been used in some sort of criminal activity, which does not fit here since it may be returned, after a period of time, and upon request with a warning. </SPAN></P>

New York's enterprise corruption statute, which renders a person guilty of enterprise corruption when, having knowledge of the existence of a criminal enterprise and the nature of its activities, and being employed by or associated with such enterprise, such person intentionally conducts or participates in the affairs of an enterprise by participating in a &quot;pattern of criminal activity&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 460.20 [1] [a]), and which defines a &quot;pattern of criminal activity&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 460.10 [4] [b]) to be &quot;conduct engaged in by persons charged in an enterprise corruption count constituting three or more criminal acts that&quot;, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;are neither isolated incidents, nor so closely related and connected in point of time or circumstance of commission as to constitute a criminal offense or criminal transaction&quot;, does not require proof that each of the defendants jointly indicted herein for enterprise corruption and related crimes have participated in three separate criminal conspiracies. Section 460.10 (4) was intended to establish that three criminal acts constitute a pattern only where they evince the requisite elements of continuity and relatedness.  The criminal enterprise must be proven to exist apart from the pattern of its criminal activity. Acts which are part of a common criminal scheme or plan are included within the &quot;pattern of criminal activity&quot; where there are other unrelated acts sufficient to establish the required continuity of criminality.  Therefore, a defendant associated with the enterprise, acting with the necessary knowledge and intent, who engages in three criminal acts which are part of a single criminal transaction may nonetheless be guilty of enterprise corruption where the transaction is itself part of the &quot;pattern of criminal activity&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant may not be prosecuted for enterprise corruption (Penal Law &sect; 460.20 [1] [a]) for his involvement in a criminal enterprise that engaged in a &quot;pattern of criminal activity&quot; designed to control a newspaper's circulation department by means of extortion, coercion, falsification of business records, bribery and other crimes for financial gain, where the evidence presented to the Grand Jury failed to establish that defendant, a member of a crime organization, committed or is otherwise liable for at least the requisite three &quot;pattern&quot; criminal acts in furtherance net of the affairs of the criminal enterprise (Penal Law &sect; 460.10 [4]).  Defendant's illegal possession of a firearm at his residence cannot properly be alleged as a criminal act of participation in the &quot;pattern of criminal activity&quot; encompassed by the enterprise.  In addition, defendant's involvement in a no-show job scheme, whereby he collected a weekly paycheck from the newspaper over a three-year period, only constitutes a single continuous larceny for purposes of the enterprise corruption statute, thereby leaving only two criminal acts having the necessary connection to the criminal enterprise.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant's possession of loaded firearms on the newspaper's premises cannot constitute &quot;pattern&quot; crimes in the absence of any evidence that such possession was in any way related to the criminal enterprise.  In addition, the evidence only establishes that defendant aided in the theft from the newspaper of at most $ 660 in the larcenous scheme involving falsified &quot;returns&quot; of nonredeemable papers, and petit larceny is not among the criminal acts designated in the enterprise corruption statute (Penal Law &sect; 460.10 [1]).  Similarly, the evidence is insufficient to support the crimes relating to the circulation scheme in the absence of any evidence that defendant was aware of the alleged conspiracy to inflate circulation figures by the creation of false delivery routes.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant, the director of circulation at a newspaper which was the target of a criminal enterprise that engaged in a &quot;pattern of criminal activity&quot; designed to control its circulation department by means of extortion, coercion, falsification of business records, bribery and other crimes for financial gain, may not be prosecuted for enterprise corruption (Penal Law &sect; 460.20 [1] [a]) for his involvement in an alleged conspiracy to inflate circulation figures since there is no evidence that defendant committed the alleged crimes of scheme to defraud and falsifying business records in order to further the criminal enterprise (Penal Law &sect; 460.10 [2]).  Rather, the evidence only supports the inference that defendant conceived and committed these crimes independently of the criminal enterprise, using some of the members of the criminal enterprise, to further the newspaper's interests by fraudulent means unrelated to the purposes of the criminal enterprise.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Defendant, a member of a criminal enterprise designed to control a newspaper's circulation department by means of extortion, coercion, falsification of business records, bribery and other crimes for financial gain, may properly be prosecuted for enterprise corruption (Penal Law &sect; 460.20 [1] [a]) based upon his commission of 20 acts of forgery in the second degree in connection with his endorsement of payroll checks issued to a deceased employee and upon his participation in the conspiracy to commit grand larceny (Penal Law &sect; 460.10 [1] [a]).  The evidence before the Grand Jury justified the inference that the larceny benefited various members of the criminal enterprise and that defendant committed the forgeries with the intent to participate in and to advance the affairs of the criminal enterprise.  Defendant's commission of three or more criminal acts as part of a common scheme or plan constitutes participation in the &quot;pattern of criminal activity&quot;, where the transaction is part of a larger pattern established by evidence of other unrelated criminal transactions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Enterprise Corruption - &quot;Pattern of Criminal Activity&quot; - Participation in Three or More &quot;Pattern&quot; Crimes - Improper Charge on Forgery Counts </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Defendants, foremen at a newspaper which was the target of a criminal enterprise that engaged in a &quot;pattern of criminal activity&quot; designed to control its circulation department by means of extortion, coercion, falsification of business records, bribery and other crimes for financial gain, may not be prosecuted for enterprise corruption (Penal Law &sect; 460.20 [1] [a]) based upon their commission of the crime of conspiracy to commit grand larceny pursuant to a payroll scheme, whereby they each endorsed payroll checks issued to a deceased employee, and upon the &quot;pattern&quot; crimes of forgery, possession of a forged instrument and falsifying business records since the prosecutor did not adequately instruct the Grand Jury as to the elements constituting the alleged &quot;pattern&quot; criminal acts. Defendants signed the payroll checks in their own names in a representative capacity as foremen.  Under such circumstances, the instruments could only have been forgeries if defendants knew that the payee was nonexistent (Penal Law &sect; 170.00 [5]), but the Grand Jury was not instructed as to this legal principle.  Therefore, the prosecution may not rely on the alleged &quot;pattern&quot; crimes of forgery or of criminal possession of a forged instrument as to those defendants who signed their names to the payroll checks in the absence of any other evidence of intent to defraud.  Furthermore, although the evidence was sufficient as to the defendant foreman who deposited a payroll check into his own account, the single criminal act does not establish that this defendant committed the requisite three criminal acts included within the &quot;pattern of criminal activity&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 460.10 [4]; &sect; 460.20 [2]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner homosexual law student filed a petition for review of an order of respondent Commissioner of the Division of Human Rights, which dismissed appellant's complaint and reversed a determination of the Division of Human Rights that respondent law school engaged in an improper discriminatory action when it permitted the use of law school placement services by an employer which discriminated upon the basis of sexual orientation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent law school allowed military recruiters to use its placement services and facilities. Petitioner homosexual law student filed a complaint claiming respondent law school violated Governor's Exec. Order No. 28.1, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 4.28, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, because the military engaged in such discrimination. The Division of Human Rights found that respondent law school engaged in an improper discriminatory action, but respondent Commissioner of the Division of Human Rights (commissioner) reversed, finding that state and federal law required respondent law school to provide access to the military for recruitment. The court granted the petition for review. A plain reading of state law permitted application of a uniform anti-discrimination policy by an educational institution. Further, respondent commissioner's findings, that the executive order could not prohibit lawful discrimination and that the military policy of exclusion based upon sexual orientation was lawful under federal law, was error as it ignored the direct violation of the executive order by respondent law school, a part of the executive branch.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colleges and Universities - Military Recruitment - Denying Access to Military Recruiters at State Institutions Due to Sexual Orientation Discrimination in Employment Practices - No Federal Preemption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law school at a State University engaged in an improper discriminatory action in violation of Governor's Executive Order No. 28, which prohibits sexual orientation discrimination by any State agency or department (9 NYCRR 4.28), by allowing military recruiters the use of its placement services and university facilities since the military currently engages in sexual orientation discrimination in its employment practices. State law, which mandates on-campus military recruitment access &quot;on the same basis&quot; as other employers (Education Law &sect; 2-a), permits application of a uniform antidiscrimination policy by an educational institution to which the statute applies and does not grant any preferential treatment to military recruiters so as to require the law school to provide access to the military for recruitment. The statute is not violated by applying to military recruiters the same antidiscrimination policies applicable to other potential employers. Furthermore, the fact that the military's practice of discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation is permissible under Federal law does not deprive the State, on preemption grounds, of power of prohibit discriminatory employment practices and limit recruitment speech.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tortfeasors, a husband and wife, sought to protect transcripts and memoranda relating to surveillance tapes taken of plaintiff injured party as attorney's work product as privileged under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tortfeasors admitted liability for negligence after their vehicle struck the injured party. Prior to commencement of the damages portion of the trial, the tortfeasors turned over, for examination to the other side, videotapes taken of the injured party unbeknownst to him. The injured party asserted that he was entitled to see any existing notes or memos relating to the tapes pursuant to N.Y. C.P.LR. 3101(i). The tortfeasors took the position that any such material was privileged and violated the attorney-client relationship. The court held that fairness required any memoranda to be disclosed because a hidden manipulation could become apparent from the contents of the documents. In addition, there was no basis to raise a constitutional issue since the parties were on an equal footing and the only remaining issue was the amount of damages. The court declined to extend, in a civil case, the protection guaranteed in criminal prosecutions under the Fifth Amendment. The underlying policy of the privilege was designed to protect individuals from oppression at the hands of a state exercising its awesome powers of investigation and could not be used in this civil matter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs are entitled to disclosure of memoranda of videotapes taken by defendants' investigators to refute plaintiff's claim of alleged serious injuries because the memoranda are discoverable material pursuant to CPLR 3101 (i). Videotapes and memoranda regarding videotapes are easily manipulated. Thus, they must be disclosed so that an adversary will be able to discover whether the tape has been distorted or manipulated. A sense of fairness requires any memoranda be disclosed as part of discovery prior to trial. A court may, however, authorize redaction of any information in the memoranda that constitutes attorney's work product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disclosure - Material Exempt from Disclosure - Material Prepared for Litigation - Surveillance Tapes and Memoranda of Surveillance Tapes of Personal Injury Plaintiff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiffs are entitled to disclosure of memoranda of videotapes taken by defendants' investigators to refute plaintiff's claim of alleged serious injuries because the memoranda are discoverable material, pursuant to CPLR 3101 (i), and discovery of the tapes is not excessive and unconstitutional. New York law favors an open disclosure policy and liberal interpretation of CPLR 3101 has been the hallmark of this policy. A mere allegation of infirmity is insufficient to raise an issue under CPLR 3101 (i) where no specific facts are offered to support the claim. In addition, because parties to a civil action are on an equal footing, the Court of Appeals has declined to extend to civil cases the protection guaranteed in criminal prosecutions under the Fifth Amendment. Thus, the defendants have no basis to raise a constitutional issue. </SPAN></P>

Sculptor filed suit seeking damages for copies of the cast which he had planned to reproduce and sell. Tenant, landlord, and apartment building managing agent contended that because sculptor made the cast without tenant's consent and planned to sell copies thereof, his actions constituted trade under N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action by plaintiff sculptor to recover damages allegedly arising from the corporate and individual defendants' negligent destruction of a plaster casting made of the individual defendant, and modified by plaintiff without the individual defendant's consent, which plaintiff intended to use to make a limited edition of 10 copies thereof for sale, plaintiff is not barred from introducing evidence as to his claim for damages for the 10 copies on the ground that his actual and intended actions constituted &quot;trade&quot; for which the individual defendant could have obtained injunctive relief and damages under Civil Rights Law &sect;&sect; 50 and 51. Although generally these statutes are utilized to obtain affirmative relief, the concept that underlies them can be used defensively as defendants do here. However, because Civil Rights Law &sect; 50 is a penal provision, it does not apply to the civil act here; additionally, just because plaintiff incidentally intended to sell a limited number of copies of his creation, that does not mean that he was acting &quot;for the purpose of trade&quot;, which is barred by Civil Rights Law &sect; 51. While a person's right of privacy as protected by sections 50 and 51 is a very significant right, it must fall to the constitutionally protected right of freedom of speech. An artist may make a work of art that includes a recognizable likeness of a person without his or her consent and sell a limited number of copies thereof without violating Civil Rights Law &sect;&sect; 50 and 51.  </SPAN></P>

New York City is authorized to enact the term limit legislation proposed in the voter initiative petitions under its home rule powers since such legislation relates to the City's &quot;affairs&quot; and/or &quot;government&quot; as well as to the &quot;terms of office&quot; of its &quot;officers&quot; (Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 [1] [i], [ii] [a] [1]; NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [c]).

The limitation of the number of consecutive terms of certain City officials is not an arbitrary exclusion from office, but rather is a rational decision that would have a neutral application toward all candidates and would not discriminate on the basis of race, creed, color or sex.  Furthermore, the proposed term limit legislation has rational bases, viz., to broaden opportunities for political and public participation, reduce the opportunities for corruption, and increase citizens' confidence in the integrity of their government.  </SPAN></P>

All voters will still be able to find, on the ballot, a candidate who most nearly reflects his or her policy preferences on contemporary issues.  The proposed local law would be neutrally applied to all political parties, so as not to burden the right to vote by restricting the individual voter's choice to only major-party candidates. The proposed local law would in no way violate the constitutional rule of &quot;one voter, one vote&quot; nor would the constitutional right of association be infringed since associational rights do not require that any particular individual serve as a candidate. </SPAN></P>

The proposed term limit law would not unconstitutionally infringe on the equal protection or due process rights of elected officials to seek or hold office since there is no &quot;fundamental right&quot; to be a candidate. Term limits can be sustained as being rationally related to such legitimate governmental purposes as broadening opportunities for political and public participation, reducing the opportunities for corruption, and increasing citizens' confidence in the integrity of their government.  Respondents have otherwise failed to demonstrate that term limits of public officers of New York City are of sufficient importance to the State, generally, to render term limits an improper subject of local legislation.  Rather, the proposed law is a proper subject of local legislation under the City's home rule powers (Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 [1] [i], [ii] [a] [1]; NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [c]) since it clearly implicates substantial matters of local concern.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers sought to enjoin the Board from enforcing &sect; 440, which allowed the Board to compel officers to appear before and respond to inquiries of the Board and its civilian investigators, arguing that &sect; 440 violated their constitutional right against self-incrimination. The court found that the officers failed to demonstrate any likelihood of ultimate success on the merits of their claims, and therefore denied injunctive relief. The court rejected the officers' argument regarding self-incrimination because it found that the officers' responses were automatically cloaked with immunity and could not be used against them in a subsequent criminal prosecution, even though &sect; 440 did not expressly authorize the Board to grant use immunity. The court held that when a public employee was compelled to give testimony under the threat of job loss, the responses were cloaked with use immunity. Accordingly, in this case, because the officers were required to respond to questions by the Board, the court found that their responses were protected. The court also rejected the officers' argument that &sect; 440 impaired their contractual rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 440 of the New York City Charter, which establishes a new Civilian Complaint Review Board comprised entirely of non-police-department personnel, is not unconstitutional for failing to expressly protect the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination of police officers called to testify before the Board since use immunity requires no specific statutory authorization. An officer responding to a Board inquiry and threatened with suspension or discharge from the force if the officer refuses to respond to any questions is automatically cloaked with use immunity in any future criminal proceedings.

The judgment creditor argued that full payment was required because the judgment debtor tendered payment of its first installment of $ 43,471 due under the second amended judgment on July 7 rather than July 1, 1993. However, article 5044 did not define what constituted a failure to make a payment in a timely fashion. The court found the judgment creditor did not establish that the judgment debtor had failed to make a payment in a timely fashion within the meaning of article 5044 on this record.

The court is vested with some discretion in determining whether a judgment debtor's conduct has actually amounted to a failure to make a payment in a timely fashion in the context presented.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer challenged two regulations promulgated by the state insurance agency, asserting that they were beyond the scope of authority delegated to the agency by the legislature. The court determined that the pool contributions mandated by Regulation 146, N.Y. Comp.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Standing of Commercial Health Insurer to Challenge Mandatory Pooling Mechanism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Petitioner, a commercial health insurer, has standing to challenge an Insurance Department regulation (11 NYCRR part 361) which, pursuant to the statutory mandate of chapter 501 of the Laws of 1992 that commercial health insurers doing business in New York employ community rating and offer open enrollment for any insurance market in which they participate, requires it to make payment to an insurance pool, even though petitioner has not clearly demonstrated its claim of injury in fact. The merits of the claim should be reached in this case in view of the important purpose of the enabling statute of broadening the availability and affordability of health insurance in New York by precluding commercial insurers from offering coverage only to low-risk individuals and in view of the Legislature's strongly expressed interest in encouraging insurers to remain in the individual and small group markets to assure greater availability of health insurance in the State. While standing principles require something more than the interest of the public at large to entitle a person to seek judicial review, proof of special damage or injury in fact is not required in every instance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurance - Health and Accident Insurance - Individual and Small Group Health Insurance - Validity of Mandatory Pool Contributions by Insurers Having Lower Share of High-Risk Insureds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An Insurance Department regulation which establishes a pooling mechanism whereby commercial health insurers who have a lower share of high-risk insureds must contribute to the pool while insurers who have a higher share of high-risk insureds may withdraw from the pool, is authorized by the enabling statute (L 1992, ch 501) and is in all respects valid. The mandatory pool contributions do not constitute an unconstitutional tax and are within the State's power to regulate the industry. Nor do such contributions constitute a taking by regulation without just compensation since any insurer required to contribute to the pool may include the contribution amount in its rate increase application. Moreover, any property interest an insurer has in its business arises from, and may be altered by, State law, especially in view of the State's constitutional authority to protect its citizens against sickness, by insurance or otherwise (NY Const. art VII, &sect; 8 [2]). Furthermore, nothing in the enabling statute limits application of the pooling mechanism to only future policies written after the statute's effective date. In addition, the regulation represents a rational interpretation of the enabling statute, which was intended to extend the burden of insuring high-risk customers to commercial insurers; it is reasonable to interpret the pooling mechanism as a device which was intended to benefit Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield, the only insurer in the State which was obligated to provide coverage for high-risk insureds. Lastly, the Legislature must be deemed to have intended that contributions to the pooling mechanism be mandatory since a pool dependent on voluntary contributions would likely be wholly ineffective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurance - Health and Accident Insurance - Individual and Small Group Health Insurance - Validity of Regulation Requiring Insurers of &quot;Small Groups&quot; to Extend Health Coverage to Individual Proprietors and Groups of Two</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An Insurance Department regulation which, pursuant to the statutory mandate of chapter 501 of the Laws of 1992 that Commercial health insurers doing business in New York employ community rating and offer open enrollment for any insurance market in which they participate in order to precluded commercial insurers from offering coverage only to low-risk individuals, requires insurers of &quot;small groups&quot; to also extend coverage to individual proprietors and groups of two (11 NYCRR 360.4 [c]), is contrary to the unambiguous statutory directive defining &quot;small group&quot; as groups of 3 to 50 (Insurance Law &sect; 3233 [a]) and is thus invalid for exceeding the scope of the delegated authority. Insurance Law &sect; 3231 (b), which provides that &quot;[i]ndividual proprietors and groups of two must be classified in the individual or small group rating category by the insurer&quot;, applies only to the rating of policies, requiring insurers who offer insurance to individual proprietors and groups of two to rate them in either the individual or small group category, and does not provide authority for requiring insurers of small groups to extend coverage to individual proprietors and groups of two. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurance - Health and Accident Insurance - Individual and Small Group Health Insurance - Validity of Regulation Changing Minimum Participation Levels among Employees in Order to Qualify for Small Group Health Coverage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  An Insurance Department regulation which, pursuant to the statutory mandate of chapter 501 of the Laws of 1992 that commercial health insurers doing business in New York employ community rating and offer open enrollment for any insurance market in which they participate in order to preclude commercial insurers from offering coverage only to low-risk individuals, amends existing law establishing minimum participation levels among employees in order to qualify for small group coverage (Insurance Law &sect; 4235 [c]) by requiring the insurer to offer a group policy if 50% of the employees elect to participate in the small group policy or in a policy offered by a health maintenance organization (11 NYCRR 360.3 [a][1][ii]), is null and void as exceeding the limit of authority delegated to the Department. While the regulation is not inconsistent with the Legislature's goal of making coverage more widely available, it conflicts with the express statement that commercial insurers should be encouraged to remain in the small group market in pursuit of that goal. General statements of legislative intent do not provide unlimited authorization to the Insurance Department to effect substantive changes in existing law. </SPAN></P>

The Bill of Particulars did not give specific dates of instances of the crime being committed and instead stated that the crime was for an unspecified period lasting sixteen months. The court concluded that both criminal usury and grand larceny fell into the category of crimes that were sometimes continuous and sometimes not continuous. As the Bill of Particulars alleged a single loan to a single individual with a single purpose that constituted a common scheme or plan for personal gain, the court found that each of payment of interest was part of a single continuous course of conduct. As such, the motion to dismiss Count 1 of the Indictment was denied as the period specified in the indictment complied with constitutional mandates and was not duplicitous. The motion also was denied as to Count 2, since the allegations pertaining to it were also sufficient.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's motion to dismiss count one of the indictment charging criminal usury in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 190.42) on the ground that the indictment is vague and duplicitous is denied, where the People allege a single loan, to a single individual, with a single purpose, constituting a single common scheme or plan, for personal gain. Given the legislative intent and purposes, and the nature of the crime, criminal usury falls into a hybrid category of crimes, which have an element that sometimes can be committed by a single act or omission or by several different acts or omissions over a period of time; here, the People's allegations militate toward the conclusion that each payment of interest be deemed part of a single continuous course of conduct. Additionally, the prosecution is directed to particularize the approximate month in which the crime commenced, absent which the &quot;16-month&quot; period stated in the bill of particulars is too nonspecific.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Citizens challenged chapter 56's mechanism for financing a bond plan authorized for the transportation authority and the thruway authority.

The doctrine of stare decisis required the court to follow precedent. The citizens failed to prove that chapter 56 was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. The legislature had the authority to dedicate proceeds of particular taxes to the use of a public corporation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs asserted a civil claim against defendants, publications company and newspapers, under the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2510 et seq. Defendant publications company filed a pre-answer motion for dismissal of the complaint on the basis that it did not state a claim against it upon which relief can be granted under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211(a)(7). Defendant newspaper then filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that defendants eavesdropped and illegally intercepted and recorded private telephonic communications of plaintiffs. The complaint alleged that defendants intentionally and maliciously used electronic, mechanical, and other devices to intercept plaintiffs' telephonic communications in order to obtain political, economic, personal and other advantage at plaintiffs' expense. It was alleged that a certain illegally recorded tape of a private communication between plaintiffs was distributed by defendants to the media defendants. It was further alleged that the student college newspaper and its editors intentionally published, disclosed to the public, and used the contents of the illegally recorded oral wire and electronic communications in an article. The local daily newspaper allegedly intentionally published, disclosed, and used the contents of the same illegally intercepted and recorded tape in an article. The court stated that the governmental interest in protecting the privacy of telephonic communications from unauthorized intrusion was sufficiently substantial to permit the punishment of the publication of truthful information lawfully obtained.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant newspapers' motion to dismiss a complaint asserting a civil claim pursuant to 18 USC &sect; 2510 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., and alleging that they intentionally published, disclosed to the public and used in newspaper articles the contents of illegally recorded private telephonic conversations relating to matters of public interest procured by private parties in the first instance is denied. Defendants are not protected by a blanket rule, based upon the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, prohibiting an award of damages against the media for publication of true information lawfully acquired.  18 USC &sect; 2511 prohibits knowing disclosure by third parties without regard to participation in the illegal interception, and no exception is made for the media. The rule prohibiting the publication of the contents of illegal wiretapes or other electronic surveillance with knowledge of the illegality has sufficiently defined parameters to be readily understood and applied, and the civil sanctions of 18 USC &sect; 2520 are narrowly tailored to a Federal constitutional interest of the highest order. While there is a weighty fundamental interest in the free dissemination of information under the First Amendment, the conversations intercepted were purely private and no public interest is served by their revelation. The governmental interest in protecting the privacy of telephone communications from unauthorized intrusion is sufficiently substantial to permit the punishment of the publication of truthful information lawfully obtained in this case.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of multiple kidnapping, sexual assault, and other offenses. At his jury trial, the trial judge had become incapacitated after evidence had begun and was replaced by another judge without defendant's consent. Defendant then appealed and sought to have the guilty verdicts set aside.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue of whether a judge, who became incapacitated after evidence had begun at a criminal jury trial, could be replaced by another judge to complete the trial over defendant's objection was one of first impression in New York. Defendant's trial had already begun when the sitting judge was admitted to the hospital for cardiac surgery. The judge that ultimately heard the case was approached about the consequences of a possible substitution in an &quot;academic discussion.&quot; The judge then was assigned the case, upon which defendant sought recusal. The court refused to set aside the guilty verdicts and held that recusal was not required. There was no suggestion of actual or apparent bias, and no prejudice was claimed by defendant. The judge thoroughly read the trial transcript for the earlier portion of the trial. Neither federal nor New York law precluded a midtrial substitution for an incapacitated judge without defendant's consent. The case was tried to a jury, thereby removing the possibility of unfairness to defendant. Because New York adhered to a strict separation between the responsibilities of the judge and jury, substitution in the instant case was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the substitution of trial judges was proper and that it would have been entirely unwarranted to set aside the jury verdict and require a retrial. Defendant's motion was denied in all respects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judges - Recusal - Midtrial Substitution for Incapacitated Judge in Criminal Jury Trial </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Judge who replaced an incapacitated Judge to complete a criminal jury trial over defendant's objection to the midtrial substitution need not recuse himself on defendant's motion to have the guilty verdicts set aside on the ground that continuation of the trial was improper, in the absence of any actual or apparent bias arising from some personal interest in the outcome of the case or some connection with it that would require disqualification as a matter of law.  The fact that the substituted Judge, in casual conversation with defendant's attorney prior to the actual substitution, expressed a preliminary view that midtrial substitution would be permissible provided that the new Judge adhered to all rulings made by the original Judge and was furnished with the record of prior proceedings to become familiar with the evidence in the case, does not disqualify the substituted Judge from now deciding defendant's postverdict motion.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Trial - Propriety of Midtrial Substitution for Incapacitated Judge in Jury Trial </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the absence of a showing of prejudice, substitution for an incapacitated Trial Judge after evidence has begun in a criminal jury trial by a Judge of coordinate jurisdiction who has reviewed and become thoroughly familiar with the trial record and who is bound by the rulings of the original Judge, is permissible even without defendant's consent.  Since New York law establishes and adheres to a strict separation between the responsibility of the Judge to decide questions of law and the jury to find the facts, neither Judiciary Law &sect; 21, which provides that a lower court Judge cannot decide any question argued during his or her absence, nor any other statutory provision prevents a substituted Judge from completing a jury trial in which the Judge will not be called upon to render a decision based upon an evaluation of unheard testimony.  The fact that a substituted Judge has not personally heard the witnesses who testified before the substitution does not, in and of itself, impair that Judge's ability to perform the judicial functions and responsibilities necessary for the completion of a jury trial in conformance with New York law.  Accordingly, midtrial substitution herein was proper after the original Judge became incapacitated due to cardiac surgery and defendant's motion to set aside the guilty verdicts because of the substitution is therefore denied.  </SPAN></P>

The harassing conduct of defendant in repeatedly threatening and physically abusing the complainant at his place of employment because of complainant's perceived race or creed provided a factual basis for the jury's verdict that defendant intentionally interfered with complainant's &quot;civil right&quot; to pursue employment and to engage in the use and occupancy of the food store, in contravention of the statute.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the city condemnor filed its condemnation application under &sect; 20(2), the parties, in response to the court's inquiry concerning the justiciability of the application, stipulated that &sect; 20(2) was constitutional and that it did not call for an advisory opinion. The court held that the application presented a dispute which was not justiciable because it called for an advisory opinion, it presented a question which was not ripe for determination, and it presented a contingent question. In so holding, the court found: (1) because there was no de facto taking or acquisition of the property under &sect; 20(2), it did not have jurisdiction over the proceeding pursuant to Article 5 of the Eminent Domain Procedure; (2) the relief sought was advisory because it sought a decision declaring what method of valuation the court would use and did not concern the legal rights and obligations of the parties; (3) the question presented and relief sought was contingent and not ripe for determination because the &sect; 20(2) provision that permitted the condemnor to withdraw the proceeding if not satisfied with the method of valuation or the actual valuation would render any decision void.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A proceeding brought by the City of New York pursuant to General City Law &sect; 20 (2) to have the court determine in advance, prior to any valuation trial, the appropriate method of valuation and the value of the property that the City proposes to acquire for its water distribution system must be dismissed since the petition presents a dispute which is not justiciable in that it calls for an advisory opinion, presents a question which is not ripe for judicial review, and presents a question which is contingent upon the happening of a future event that may or may not come to pass.  A declaration of the method of valuation and a declaration of the value of the property the City proposes to acquire does not present a cognizable claim for declaratory judgment relief pursuant to CPLR 3001 since the petition seeks a determination of wholly factual matters and does not concern the legal rights, obligations, or relations of the parties.  Furthermore, although General City Law &sect; 20 (2) clearly provides a basis for the relief sought, the statute is unconstitutional to the extent that it directs the court to render an advisory opinion regarding valuation only, prior to any taking of any property or any legal commitment by the City to acquire the property, and prior to the condemnee suffering any actual damages.  The Legislature is without power to direct the court to act as an appraiser of damages and advise the City regarding the appropriate method of valuation and to estimate the value of the property the City proposes to acquire, before the City makes any legal commitment to acquire the property.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The radio common carriers sought a declaratory judgment that N.Y. Tax Law &sect;1150, entitled &quot;Special fee on paging devices,&quot; was unconstitutional on its face and as applied. They also requested that attorneys' fees be awarded pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1988. Contending that the fee was in reality a tax, the radio common carriers argued that it impermissibly discriminated against interstate commerce, unconstitutionally imposed an exaction upon out-of-state customers, and violated the due process and equal protection Clauses of the constitutions of the United States and the State of New York. Upon review, the court agreed and held for the radio common carriers on all counts. The court also found that the statute was impermissibly vague and violated the prohibition against double taxation. The court granted the radio carrier's request that attorneys' fees be paid by defendants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. New York's flat $ 1 monthly &quot;fee&quot; imposed on each radio &quot;paging device used or authorized for use in conjunction with a paging service, where such service is provided for consideration&quot; (Tax Law &sect; 1150) is an unconstitutional tax violative of the Commerce Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 8, cl [3]) under the United States Supreme Court's four-part test, which requires findings that the tax is applied to an activity with a &quot;substantial nexus&quot; with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to services provided by the State.  The &quot;substantial nexus&quot; component of the test is not satisfied merely because electronic signals pass through the State nor does the tax imposed by section 1150 insure that New York taxes only its fair share of an interstate transaction.  Furthermore, the levy also places a disproportionate burden on transactions that cross State lines, in that out-of-State users who seldom, if ever, use their pagers in New York, are subjected to the same amount of tax as is paid by intrastate users. In addition, it cannot be said that section 1150 is fairly related to any services provided by the State to the class of out-of-State users involved in this case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Sales and Use Taxes - Special &quot;Fee&quot; on Paging Devices Unconstitutional as Violative of Due Process and Prohibition against Double Taxation </SPAN></P>

New York's flat $ 1 monthly &quot;fee&quot; imposed on each radio &quot;paging device used or authorized for use in conjunction with a paging service, where such service is provided for consideration&quot; (Tax Law &sect; 1150), violates the Due Process Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions since there is no link, definite or otherwise, between New York and the class of users who reside, work and use their pagers outside of New York.  The mere &quot;authorization&quot; to use one's beeper in this State is an insufficient connection to satisfy due process requirements.  Furthermore, the tax statute, by incorporating some other &quot;provisions&quot; of the sales tax article, &quot;insofar as [they] can be made applicable&quot; and by not defining the &quot;modifications as may be necessary to adapt such other provisions to the fee so imposed&quot;, is also impermissibly vague. In addition, the statute also violates the prohibition against double taxation without specific legislative authorization by imposing a tax in addition to the sales tax on the sale or lease of a beeper. The statute's designation of the payment as a &quot;fee&quot; indicates that the Legislature did not intend to impose double taxation. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner police submitted two search warrant applications, particularly in order to seize vehicles where no search was desired. Reviewing N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law 690.10, seizure of the four vehicles purchased with the proceeds of drug transactions did not fit into any one of the four categories in that section. No warrant could be issued for them. The application to obtain the vehicle used in commission of the crimes alleged sufficient facts to justify issuing the warrant, by alleging that cocaine was unlawfully possessed in the vehicle and by alleging that cocaine was possessed in the vehicle for the purpose of unlawful sale. The search warrant did not permit the forfeiture of the vehicle; however, if the officers wished to obtain forfeiture there were other statutory provisions available for them to proceed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The application for the first search warrant to seize the suspect individual's motor vehicle as the instrumentality of a drug transaction was granted, and the application for the second search warrant to seize the suspect individual's four motor vehicles as the substituted proceeds of drug transactions was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Search warrants cannot be used for any purpose except as stated in the applicable criminal statutes.  Thus, an application for a search warrant pursuant to CPL 690.10 to seize the suspect individual's motor vehicle as an instrumentality of a drug transaction is granted under the authority of Public Health Law &sect; 3388, which authorizes the seizure and forfeiture of a vehicle used to facilitate illegal drug transactions, where the application seeks to seize the suspect individual's vehicle and not to search that vehicle and seize cocaine if it is located, as is provided for under CPL 690.10.  Public Health Law &sect; 3388 provides a procedure for the police to seize only the suspect individual's vehicle, and does not require judicial intervention; however, since the constitutionality of this section is doubtful, the safest course is for the police to comply by applying for a seizure warrant upon a showing of probable cause for forfeiture, as is the case here.  Additionally, a second search warrant application to authorize the seizure of the suspect individual's four particularly described motor vehicles as the substituted proceeds of drug transactions is denied where the allegations do not fit into any of the categories in CPL 690.10 or Public Health Law &sect; 3388.  Forfeiture of all five vehicles would be available pursuant to Penal Law article 480 or CPLR article 13-A.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate, a native of Haiti who spoke French, appeared before the New York State Board of Parole (Board) for early release. The court vacated the decision of the Board that affirmed the denial of the inmate's release, holding that it was affected by an error of law. The court held that the Board's ability to determine whether the inmate could live without violating the law necessitated exploring various questions relating to her offense. However, the inmate's ability to understand the questions was reduced by the fact that they were posed to her in Spanish, a language she understood, but not very well. The substantial decrease in the inmate's capacity to be successfully interviewed caused by the absence of an adequate interpreter detrimentally affected her chances for parole release. The court held that, given that the record did not support the Board's decision to utilize a Spanish interpreter, the hearing was not fair, and was not an interview under N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 259-i(2)(a). Because the inmate was not afforded an interview, the appeals unit of the Board could not accede in a decision to deny her application for parole release.</SPAN></P>

A parole hearing conducted entirely in English can be deemed to be &quot;fair&quot; only where the parole applicant demonstrably understood clearly the questions and comments made during the course of the hearing and where the applicant further demonstrably gave responses in English that adequately addressed the subject matter presented and were understood by the members of the Parole Board who conducted the interview. Unless interpreters in a language preferred by the parole applicant are demonstrably unavailable or nonexistent, a decision to utilize a non-English language other than that preferred by the applicant is irrational if, as here, as a result of the applicant's relative degrees of fluency and/or comprehension, the decision to utilize such third language could have affected the outcome of the proceeding to the detriment of the applicant.  Furthermore, the fact that one panel member was able to understand petitioner's English does not meet the regulatory requirement of an &quot;interview&quot; conducted by two members of the Board of Parole where the second member never asserted his ability to understand petitioner's English.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent comptroller found that petitioner state employee had been overpaid due to his submission of allegedly fraudulent time sheets. Respondent determined that the state was entitled to a set off and recoup from petitioner's lump-sum separation from service entitlement. Petitioner filed an application to declare respondent's determination null and void. The court reversed, granted the petition, and held that respondents' powers were exercised arbitrarily and capriciously. The court found that petitioner was never given timely notice of respondent's audit of his payroll account or its intent to offset the claim for overtime overpayment against his severance allowance.

The Comptroller has the inherent authority to recoup an overpayment made to a State employee from the employee's salary; however, where, as here, the alleged overpayment did not result from the State's &quot;administrative error&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;State Finance Law &sect; 200 [3] [b] [iii]), a condition precedent to the right of recoupment is a quasi-judicial, due process determination by the Comptroller that there exists a valid claim subject to recoupment. The disciplinary proceeding instituted against petitioner was abandoned upon his retirement and never resulted in a due process determination of the validity of respondent's claim that petitioner owed the State money.  Petitioner was never given notice of the Comptroller's audit of his payroll account or intent to offset the claim for overtime overpayment against his severance allowance prior to the Comptroller's action.  Petitioner was therefore not afforded a meaningful opportunity to submit evidence or arguments in opposition to the Comptroller's action nor did he have a meaningful opportunity to be heard by the agency by which he was employed before that agency requested the offset from the Comptroller. </SPAN></P>

The court conducted a hearing on defendant's motion to suppress the gun and ordered that the gun must be suppressed. The court held that N.Y. Comp.

Although the regulation herein satisfies the first two prongs, in that the government's interest in highway safety is substantial and the defendant has a diminished expectation of privacy in his vehicle, the absence of any safeguards on the otherwise unlimited discretion of police officers in conducting safety inspections renders the regulation unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 4204.15 (1983) was adopted to require the off-track betting corporations (OTB) to restore to the betting public &quot;missed pool&quot; bets taken in by OTBs, which failed to be included in the pari-mutuel betting pool, and were thus not used to calculate payouts. The effect of the procedure was to reduce the amount that was payable to all winners had the wagers been included in the pool, and to permit the OTBs to pocket amounts that properly should have accrued to successful bettors. The court upheld the board's broad powers to regulate, and found that the manner in which the regulation was published and enacted was proper. However, the court found that the regulation was vague and not susceptible of precise meaning because the memorandum directive for implementation provided no guidance to effect the return of the accumulated &quot;missed pool&quot; gains or profits. The court granted a preliminary injunction to the OTBs until a proper implementing regulation was devised that showed that the profits and gains would be going into the proper betting pools for redistribution. The court denied a counterclaim to carry out the Board's directives.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the payments directed by the regulation and memorandum directive do not constitute an improper and unauthorized penalty.  The Board has the power to order that the profits or gains from &quot;missed pool&quot; bets be returned to bettors at a later date.  However, the regulation and implementing directive are impermissibly vague and impossible of performance to the extent that there is no detailed plan for the infusion of the total amount of &quot;missed pool&quot; gains and profits back into specific races and specific bets. </SPAN></P>

Even if the funds should be distributed to &quot;participating counties&quot; and not turned back to the bettors, there is no assurance in the record that the funds would actually reach the counties.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The State Racing and Wagering Board is authorized, by way of regulation (9 NYCRR 5204.15) and implementing memorandum directive, to require plaintiffs, the State's six off-track betting corporations (OTBs), to restore to the betting public, in the form of &quot;sweetened pools&quot; for winning bettors on a designated special racing day, &quot;missed pool&quot; bets from 1983 to 1990 that were taken in by the OTBs but not included in the on-track pari-mutuel betting pool and thus not used to calculate the payouts, but plaintiffs are granted preliminary injunctive relief against compliance until a proper implementing regulation or memorandum is devised which clearly shows that the &quot;missing pools&quot; profits and gains will be going into the proper betting pools for redistribution.  Defendant New York Racing Association (NYRA) is not entitled to an order directing the OTBs to &quot;carry out the Board's directives&quot; so as to assure that the bank transfer clearance &quot;mechanism&quot; will work on the special racing day in the event there is an imbalance in a pool among successful wagers at various OTBs and the track since there are no grounds for such an order directing the OTBs to comply with any directives that have not as yet been formulated.  Furthermore, plaintiffs state a valid cause of action under the regulation against intervenors NYRA and a track operator for their failure to have included timely transmitted bets into the State-wide pool, thereby resulting in the OTBs ending up with &quot;missed pools&quot; funds as to which they either made a profit or a loss depending on the number of winning tickets that they sold, but such cause of action is severed since the outcome of the main dispute is not dependent on any rights of recovery that the OTBs may have against the track operators.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The State Racing and Wagering Board has the authority, by way of regulation (9 NYCRR 5204.15) and implementing memorandum directive, to require plaintiffs, the State's six off-track betting corporations, to restore to the betting public, in the form of &quot;sweetened pools&quot; for winning bettors on a designated special racing day, &quot;missed pool&quot; bets from 1983 through 1990 that were taken in by the OTBs but not included in the on-track pari-mutuel betting pool and thus not used to calculate the payouts, but plaintiffs are granted preliminary injunctive relief against compliance until a proper implementing regulation or memorandum is devised which clearly shows that the profits and gains will be going into the proper betting pools for redistribution.  Furthermore, the regulation is invalid as to Nassau and Suffolk OTBs to the extent that it does not allow any offsetting of losses against gains involving the &quot;missed pool&quot; funds.  While the Board has authority to mandate that gains or profits that are made on &quot;missed pool&quot; bets should be returned to the bettors, only net gains or profits should be so returned.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs originally filed a complaint against the individual in order to recover damages for injuries that resulted from an automobile accident. By a written stipulation between the attorney for plaintiffs and the individual, it was agreed that plaintiffs could file an amended complaint. In the amended complaint, plaintiffs added on the car corporations as defendants, and filed the amended complaint and a supplemental summons without first seeking the permission of the court. In their answer to the amended complaint, the car corporations alleged that the court lacked jurisdiction over them because of plaintiffs' failure to obtain court approval prior to adding them as parties as required by N.Y. C.P.L.R. 1003. The car corporations filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The court denied the motion of the car corporations and held that service upon the car corporations gave the court jurisdiction, and that the service was not a nullity by reason of the failure to obtain prior court approval for the addition of the car corporations as defendants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Adding Additional Party - Valid Addition Absent Court Order </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where the parties to an action, by written stipulation, agreed that plaintiff may file a supplemental summons and amended complaint naming additional parties defendant and stating new causes of action against them, the service of the papers upon the additional defendants was not a nullity even though they were served without prior court approval.  CPLR 1003 provides that parties may be added by the court at any stage of the action and CPLR 3025 (b) provides that a party may amend a pleading at any time by leave of court or by stipulation of all parties.  CPLR 1003 does not contain a provision permitting joinder upon agreement of all parties.  Nevertheless, the only objection to an addition of new parties may be made by an existing party over whom the court has jurisdiction.  Normally, on an application to add parties, the defendant to be added is not present as jurisdiction over such prospective defendant is not a prerequisite to determining the motion.  Thus, absent an objection, there would be no basis for a court to reject the existing parties' desire to have additional defendants added.  In addition, parties by stipulation are free to chart their own course in the process of litigation.  Also, no rights of the nonparty are in any way affected by its joinder as any defense it possesses may be raised after joinder. Finally, because of the unusual fact pattern presented, the parties sought to be added are already before the court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughters had chosen to avoid contact with the grandfather for intensely personal reasons, arising from the circumstances of his divorce from their mother. Both daughters had intact marriages with the fathers of the grandchildren. The court held that the grandfather had no standing to bring the petition, and dismissed. The court found it could not equitably intervene to force visitation when there was total estrangement between the grandfather and the daughters, no pre-existing relationship between the grandfather and the grandchildren, and all four parents in the two intact families objected to visitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Visitation Rights of Grandparents - Lack of Standing - No Circumstances Establishing Equitable Intervention </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner maternal grandfather's petition seeking visitation with his grandchildren is denied for lack of standing where respondents, the parents of the grandchildren, are alive and object to the visitation and no equitable circumstances exist to permit the court to entertain the petition.  Because the parents are alive, and the families are intact, the grandfather does not have an absolute right to standing; thus, the petition may be entertained if the grandfather can establish circumstances in which equity would see fit to intervene. Equitable circumstances include whether the family is intact, the nature and basis of the parents' objection and the nature and extent of the grandparent-grandchild relationship.  Here, due to petitioner's divorce from his wife, petitioner had very little personal contact with his daughters from 1984 until he discovered that they had children in 1991.  In addition, petitioner was very critical of his daughters as children, all four parents are opposed to visitation emanating from the total estrangement of petitioner and his daughters, and no preexisting grandparent-grandchild relationship exists.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Commissioner of Social Services appealed the decision and order of support filed by the Hearing Examiner, which found that N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act. &sect; 449 required the payment of child support from the earlier of the date of the filing of the petition, or, if the child for whom support is sought was on public assistance, the date from which the eligibility for public assistance was effective. As a preliminary matter, the court found that the Hearing Examiner did have the power to determine the constitutionality of the legislation, although generally not the practice of courts of first instance and limited jurisdiction such as the Family Court. However, the court agreed with petitioner Commissioner of Social Services that because the question of the constitutionality of the statute was raised by the court, without the urging of the respondent father, his consent or knowledge, the Hearing Examiner committed reversible error. Before the statute could be challenged, there must have been an &quot;injury-in-fact&quot; or aggrieved party before the court could properly determine if the subject statute was or was not constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Hearing Examiners - Powers - Determination of Constitutionality of Statute&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a support proceeding involving the Child Support Standards Act, a Family Court Hearing Examiner possesses the power to determine the constitutionality of the Act as it relates to issues of support.  A Hearing Examiner is empowered to hear, determine and grant any relief within the powers of the Family Court in support or maintenance proceedings (Family Ct Act &sect; 439 [a]).  Family Court, a court of first instance and limited jurisdiction, should not ordinarily set aside a statute as unconstitutional unless such a conclusion is inescapable. A Hearing Examiner is not precluded from determining the invalidity of a statute where he or she believes that the invalidity of the statute is apparent on its face.  In addition, the constitutionality of a statute can properly be raised before a Hearing Examiner or Family Court without resort to a declaratory judgment action since a declaratory judgment action is not the sole avenue to test a statute's constitutionality in Family Court.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - No Determination of Validity Absent Aggrieved Party </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a support proceeding involving Family Court Act &sect; 449, where respondent failed to appear for the hearing, the support order was entered on default and respondent did not move to vacate the default nor file a rebuttal to petitioner's objections, respondent waived his right to raise the constitutionality of the statute; thus, the Family Court Hearing Examiner improperly raised, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">sua sponte,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and determined, the constitutionality of the statute.  The constitutionality of statutes and ordinances can be determined only in an action where the question is raised by a party aggrieved. The void-statute exception to the party aggrieved requirement for standing, available if the statute can be found unconstitutional as to others not before the court and the constitutional and unconstitutional features cannot be meaningfully severed thus rendering the entire statute invalid, is not applicable in this case.  </SPAN></P>

Codes R. &amp; Regs. &sect; 352.2(b) so that SSI income was no longer invisible for recipients of HR. In granting the commissioner's motion, the court held that the beneficiaries failed to establish that Federal law required the invisibility or disregard of SSI benefits for any purpose but Aid to Families with Dependent Children calculations. The court also found that no matter what policy was adopted concerning the special needs of the disabled, it could not be argued that mixed households were entitled to more assistance than those composed entirely of SSI recipients. The court concluded that under the new rule the beneficiaries would continue to receive benefits at a level equal to the needs of others generally.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services - Home Relief - Validity of Including Supplemental Security Income in Determining Household's Home Relief Benefits </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's inclusion of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) received by a member of a &quot;mixed household&quot; in determining the household's Home Relief benefits pursuant to a rule change (18 NYCRR 352.2 [b]) is not invalid for being in conflict with the Social Security Act since plaintiffs have failed to establish that Federal law requires the invisibility or disregard of SSI benefits for any purpose other than the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (42 USC &sect; 602 [a] [24]).  Nor is such inclusion violative of the State's affirmative duty to aid the needy (NY Const, art XVII, &sect; 1) on the ground that it deprives plaintiffs of a constitutionally mandated level of support by forcing them to devote a portion of their income to their spouse's needs, since all constitutional requirements are met by the maintenance of plaintiffs' benefits at a level equal to those of the able-bodied supported by Home Relief. There is no constitutional mandate for a higher level of support for the aged, blind and disabled. Furthermore, the rule change was lawfully promulgated pursuant to the authorization granted the Commissioner of Social Services in the 1991 Aid to Localities Budget to contain welfare costs by revising &quot;budget methodology for mixed households&quot;.  That legislative authorization was directly related to the function of a budget--the allocation of funds--and thus did not violate the constitutional prohibition against the inclusion of &quot;general legislation&quot; in appropriation bills (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 6).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor, an advocacy corporation for disabled individuals, sought a declaration that N.Y. Mental Hyg.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intervenor sought a declaration that N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law art. 78 was unconstitutional because of its failure to provide for the appointment of counsel for indigent subjects of committeeship proceedings. The Attorney General opposed the application primarily on procedural grounds. The court found that the intervenor had standing, and that the issue was ripe for judicial review. The fact that the challenged provision of the Mental Hygiene Law would be repealed and replaced with a new statute that did provide for appointment of counsel did not render the issue moot. The guardian ad litem provided pursuant to the statute did not fulfill the alleged incompetent's right. The guardian asserted what he or she believed was in the alleged incompetent's best interests rather than his or her subjective interests. The court found merit in the intervenor's request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the intervenor's application to the extent that it was determined and declared that the pertinent article of the Mental Hygiene Law was constitutional upon condition that it be construed to require the assignment of counsel at public expense to represent the subjective wishes of an indigent alleged incompetent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An application for a declaration that article 78 of the Mental Hygiene Law is unconstitutional because of its failure to provide for the appointment of counsel for indigent subjects of committeeship proceedings presents a justiciable controversy ripe for review and has not been rendered moot by the appointment of counsel for the alleged incompetent herein since the issue is one likely to evade judicial review. Moreover, even though the challenged provision will be repealed and replaced with a new statute, which does not provide for appointment of counsel, it is likely that numerous committeeship proceedings will be conducted prior to the effective date of the change of the law. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The intervenor's application for a declaration that Mental Hygiene Law article 78 is unconstitutional due to its failure to provide for the appointment of counsel for indigent subjects of committeeship proceedings is granted to the extent that it is determined that article 78 is constitutional upon condition that it be construed to require the assignment of counsel at public expense to represent the subjective wishes of an indigent alleged incompetent. Because a proceeding to declare a person incompetent effectively results in a complete loss of personal liberty and property, an indigent alleged incompetent is entitled to assignment of counsel as a matter of constitutional right. However, the guardian ad litem provided pursuant to article 78 of the Mental Hygiene Law does not fulfill this right as the guardian asserts what he or she believes is in the alleged incompetent's best interest rather than his or her subjective interests. Thus, since nothing in article 78 prohibits such assignment, the statute will be rehabilitated by supplying the missing constitutional safeguard. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Movant, a nonparty newspaper which was denied an opportunity to be heard prior to the issuance of sealing orders in a medical malpractice action against a psychiatrist based upon his alleged improper sexual relations with a patient, may not intervene at the conclusion of the trial, which resulted in a jury verdict in favor of defendant, to have the records unsealed.  Intervention pursuant to CPLR 1013 is not the proper mechanism whereby the news media are accorded an opportunity to be heard on the questions of closure or sealing of records.  Rather, the news media are accorded standing to be heard, on request, prior to a ruling on closure or sealing, without the necessity of formal intervention.  Since the sealing orders have already been made in this case, the appropriate remedy is a motion to vacate the sealing orders pursuant to CPLR 5015 (a) and since no prejudice has been claimed, the defect in procedure will be ignored ( CPLR 2001) and the motion converted from intervention to vacatur.  </SPAN></P>

The records in a medical malpractice action against a psychiatrist based upon his alleged improper sexual relations with a patient, which were ordered sealed prior to trial upon a showing of good cause (22 NYCRR 216.1) in view of the highly prejudicial nature of the proposed testimony on collateral matters and in order to avoid the possible taint of the juror pool if the allegations of sexual misconduct involving other female patients were extensively publicized, are ordered to be unsealed at the conclusion of the trial, which resulted in a jury verdict in favor of defendant.  Defendant has not met the burden of proving that good cause exists to maintain secrecy and continue the sealing. Since the matter is finally concluded at the trial court level, the reasons underlying the sealing orders no longer obtain.  The presumption of openness of court proceedings must be given effect particularly where, as here, defendant practices in a highly regulated profession and female patients ought to be aware of the serious allegations made so that they may make an intelligent decision to become or continue as patients. Accordingly, the motion by the nonparty newspaper for an order vacating the sealing orders is granted and the other witnesses' names, to the extent they may be identifiable in the submissions to the court, are to be redacted.  </SPAN></P>

Tax Law &sect; was unconstitutional because the benefit of the deduction provided therein was directly related to the percentage of the carrier's property located in the state of New York. Defendant State Department of taxation and finance filed a cross motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gross receipts of long distance carriers having operations outside New York were allocated, in determining New York State taxable receipts, pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 184(4)(c) on the basis of the proportion of the carrier's property located in New York. Local access fees were included in gross receipts, but a deduction therefor was allowed to the carrier, prior, however, to apportionment. As a result, an intrastate carrier could deduct the fee dollar for dollar, while interstate enterprises could deduct only a proportionate amount. The court first held that the carrier did not have to exhaust its administrative remedies, because the action was a declaratory action challenging the constitutionality of a taxing statute. However, the tax at issue did not violate the commerce clause, because the relative tax liabilities of carriers was not affected by their status as interstate or intrastate carriers. Because a lesser percentage of the carrier's receipts was allocated to New York, its benefit from the deduction was properly less than that of a carrier having a greater percentage of its property in-state and paying a greater percentage of its receipts to New York as a tax.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tax Law &sect; 186-a (2-a), which provides an &quot;access fee&quot; deduction for long-distance carriers to be allowed against &quot;interstate and international revenues prior to apportionment to New York&quot; in order to determine their New York tax base, is not in violation of the Equal Protection, Due Process or Commerce Clauses as unjustifiably discriminatory, even though the result is that the statute provides a lower deduction to long-distance carriers having a higher proportion of property (and therefore business) outside of New York because of the reduced tax base. Therefore, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is denied and Tax Law &sect; 186-a (2-a) is declared constitutional.  Since plaintiff only allocated 5% of its receipts to New York business, its benefit from the deduction is appropriately less than that of a company which has a greater percentage of its property in the State, and thus pays a greater percentage of its receipts to New York as a tax.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Possession of Stolen Property - Stolen Telephone Calling Card Number</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The mere knowing &quot;possession&quot; of a stolen telephone calling card number without &quot;possession&quot; of the actual telephone calling card cannot constitute the crime of criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree (Penal Law &sect; 165.45) since the card number itself is not &quot;tangible property&quot; that can be &quot;possessed&quot; within the meaning of the criminal possession statute.  The unambiguous wording of Penal Law &sect; 165.45, which proscribes the possession of &quot;stolen property&quot;, read in conjunction with Penal Law &sect; 10.00 (8), which defines &quot;possess&quot; to mean having physical possession or otherwise exercising dominion or control over &quot;tangible property&quot;, clearly indicates that the possession of intangible telephone authorization codes or calling card numbers has not yet been designated a crime.  Accordingly, defendants cannot be charged with criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree in connection with their alleged unauthorized use of telephone credit card authorization codes for the New York State Office of General Services telephone calling card system issued to members of the State Police for business-related phone calls.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Larceny - Defrauding Government - Use of Stolen Telephone Calling Card Number to Obtain Telephone Services </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The use of a stolen telephone calling card number to obtain telephone services constitutes theft of services (Penal Law &sect; 165.15 [4]) but cannot constitute the theft of &quot;property&quot; under the larceny statutes (Penal Law &sect;&sect; 155.25, 155.30 [1]).  While certain designated commodities supplied through a service constitute property which is subject to the larceny statutes, the supplying of the particular commodity, i.e., the service, is not property that can be the subject of a larceny. However, although defendant, a member of the State Police, cannot be charged with larceny for his alleged unauthorized use of telephone access codes for the New York State Office of General Services telephone calling card system, he may be charged with defrauding the government for his conduct (Penal Law &sect; 195.20) since the telephone services obtained by defendant constitute the type of &quot;property&quot; that can be fraudulently obtained by a public servant within the meaning of Penal Law &sect; 195.20.  The property/services distinction applicable to theft-related offenses is not applicable to the crime of defrauding the government, since such a distinction would serve to frustrate the purpose of the statute of punishing those who abuse their public office for personal gain or benefit, at the expense of the government and its citizenry.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Eavesdropping Warrants - Divulging Eavesdropping Warrant </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant, a former high ranking member of the State Police, may be prosecuted for divulging the existence of an eavesdropping warrant to the target of the eavesdropping order (Penal Law &sect; 250.20), but may not be similarly prosecuted for disclosing such information to a confidential informant in response to the informant's statement that the target's office and phone were &quot;bugged&quot;.  The evidence before the Grand Jury establishes that it was the informant who first brought the matter to defendant's attention and, therefore, defendant's response was not a &quot;disclosure&quot; within the meaning of the statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Statute Proscribing Disclosure of Eavesdropping Warrant </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Penal Law &sect; 250.20, which proscribes disclosing &quot;information concerning the existence or content of an eavesdropping warrant ... to another person&quot;, is not facially unconstitutional as vague or overbroad.  Moreover, the statute, as it is applied against defendant, is directed not towards the expression of ideas, but rather towards the purposeful attempt to obstruct a lawful governmental eavesdropping operation.  Defendant's interest in such expression is exceedingly minimal, when compared to the public interest in preserving the effectiveness and integrity of the court-authorized eavesdropping. In addition, the statute must be narrowly read so that the phrase &quot;discloses such information&quot; targets only disclosures made in order to obstruct, impede or prevent such interception.  By proscribing only those disclosures that are made for the express purpose of obstructing court-authorized eavesdropping whether by a public employee or a private citizen, the State interest is sufficiently compelling to override any First Amendment concerns.  </SPAN></P>

The court granted the stores' summary judgment motion in part, denied it in part, and held that: (1) the county had jurisdiction under the Municipal Home Rule Law to enact the County Law, which was not preempted because expiration of the state Item Pricing Law removed preemption and conflict; (2) no inconsistencies existed between an item pricing law and a unit pricing law; (3) equal protection was not violated because the County Law exception of Mom and Pop stores from its application was reasonable; (4) the County Law was justified and rationally-related to the need for item pricing; and (5) its penalty provisions violated due process by not providing the stores with an ability to measure the risk of violation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - County Item Pricing Law - Adequacy of Notice of Public Hearing </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Erie County Item Pricing Law, which requires supermarkets and certain other retail establishments which use laser scanning equipment to affix price tags to individual items, was validly enacted after adequate notice of public hearing was given.  The notice of public hearing published in various local papers, stating that the proposed law was &quot;in relation to item pricing in retail food establishments&quot;, adequately warned the general public as well as food stores that item pricing legislation was being considered.  The notice also gave sufficient opportunity to any establishment which sold retail foodstuffs to easily determine if such establishment would be affected.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Home Rule Powers - Validity of County Item Pricing Law - No State Preemption </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Erie County Item Pricing Law, which requires item pricing in supermarkets and certain other retail establishments which use laser scanning equipment, is not preempted or in conflict with State law and was thus validly enacted.  There was no blanket prohibition of local legislation regarding item pricing under the expired State Item Pricing Law (Agriculture and Markets Law former &sect; 214-i [8]) and the expiration of the State law in 1991 cannot be deemed to have created a greater preemption than existed under the law prior to expiration. Furthermore, there are no inconsistencies between the County Item Pricing Law, which deals with affixing of price tags to individual items, and the separate State Unit Pricing Law (Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 214-h), which deals with the display of price per measure.  There is nothing inherently inconsistent between a unit pricing law and an item pricing law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - County Item Pricing Law - Equal Protection </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Erie County Item Pricing Law, which requires supermarkets and certain other retail establishments which use laser scanning equipment to affix price tags to individual items, is not violative of equal protection for exempting &quot;Mom and Pop&quot; stores and unaffiliated convenience stores from the law since the different treatment of supermarkets and affiliated convenience stores is rationally based upon an economic finding that the need for item pricing is greatest in those stores.  In addition, the exceptions to the law's application are reasonably based upon the need to minimize the burden of item pricing to small operations which cannot absorb the cost of compliance.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - County Item Pricing Law - Due Process </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Erie County Item Pricing Law, which requires supermarkets and certain other retail establishments which use laser scanning equipment to affix price tags to individual items, does not violate plaintiffs' due process rights.  The County has demonstrated the need for item pricing and the County Law is logically related to this purpose.  Furthermore, the failure of the County Law to make any exception for sale items or to allow a general percentage exception does not render the law violative of due process since such exceptions, although reasonable, are not constitutionally mandated.  In addition, the list of excepted items is likewise not a violation of due process since each of the exceptions is rationally based upon a weighing of the need for item pricing, the difficulty in pricing certain food items, and health and welfare considerations.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - County Item Pricing Law - Vagueness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Erie County Item Pricing Law, which requires supermarkets and certain other retail establishments which use laser scanning equipment to affix price tags to individual items, is not unconstitutionally vague since the term &quot;food stores&quot; as used in the law is sufficiently precise to define the application of the entire item pricing scheme.  Furthermore, an error in drafting resulting in the use of words &quot;stock keeping unit&quot; in several places within the law when the words &quot;stock keeping item&quot; were meant, does not render the law invalid since the court in this case, in order to carry out the purpose and intent of the statutory scheme, should look beyond the statutory and industry definition of &quot;stock keeping unit&quot;, which would render much of the law meaningless, and instead give the word &quot;unit&quot; a more common dictionary meaning as &quot;item&quot;.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - County Item Pricing Law - Severance of Unconstitutional Penalty Provision </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The penalty provisions of the otherwise valid Erie County Item Pricing Law are invalid as violative of plaintiffs' rights to due process since such penalty provisions as written could result in excessive and disproportionate fines of millions of dollars, particularly if there are daily inspections. Since the penalty provisions are merely a method of enforcing the statutory purpose of requiring certain &quot;food stores&quot; to affix price labels to individual items, they can be severed from the rest of the legislation without affecting its purpose and the County Law may thus stand without the unconstitutional penalty provisions.  </SPAN></P>

The wife underwent a surgical procedure whereby several of her eggs were removed from her body and were fertilized by her husband's semen.

The court granted the husband's petition, but denied the wife's petition. The court did not have jurisdiction to determine the wife's maternity action. Section 511 of the Act provided the court with exclusive jurisdiction to establish paternity. The statute made no provision for declarations of maternity.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Whether a pregnancy occurs by virtue of sexual relations, artificial insemination in utero or in vitro fertilization, a paternity proceeding pursuant to article 5 of the Family Court Act may be commenced to rebut the presumption that any child born to a married woman is presumptively the legitimate issue of the husband and that he is the legal father.  Accordingly, in a paternity proceeding involving two children conceived through in vitro fertilization, the presumption of legitimacy has been rebutted with respect to respondents, the woman who gave birth to the children and her husband, where credible evidence consisting of the parties' testimony that petitioners, a wife and husband, underwent an in vitro fertilization procedure resulting in the implantation of six ova into respondent birth mother, blood test results indicating a high probability of petitioner husband's paternity, and respondents' testimony as to nonaccess during the critical period, clearly and convincingly establish that petitioner husband is the father of the subject children; thus, petitioner husband is entitled to a declaration of paternity with respect to the subject children.  </SPAN></P>

Inasmuch as the Family Court is a court of limited jurisdiction which must adhere to its statutorily enunciated powers, and Family Court Act article 5, the only provision for declaration of parenthood, does not provide for declarations of maternity, Family Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to determine a proceeding by petitioner genetic mother seeking a declaration of maternity with respect to two children conceived through in vitro fertilization and born to a surrogate mother.  Moreover, article 5 is not unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney claimed that the court's use of metal detector's on all persons entering the courthouse was unconstitutional. The court ruled that the use of magnetometers at the court buildings were reasonable searches to which entrants gave their implied consent. The court: (1) rejected the attorney's claim that neither the sheriff nor the Office of Court Administration had no authority to promulgate the security policy, ruling that N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 28 and N.Y. Jud.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Searches and Seizures - Validity of Courthouse Magnetometer Searches </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent Office of Court Administration has the constitutional and statutory authority (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 28; Judiciary Law &sect; 212 [1]) to promulgate the security policy requiring the use of magnetometer searches at court buildings without obtaining legislative approval.  Respondent's broad constitutional authority cannot be overturned or undermined by a narrow interpretation of the statute governing warrantless arrests ( CPL 140.50).  In addition, the use of magnetometers is not contrary to Judiciary Law &sect; 4, which requires that court sittings be public.  Furthermore, warrantless magnetometer searches at court buildings are constitutionally reasonable searches to which entrants give their implied consent to the extent that such searches are uniformly applied to prospective entrants, are minimally intrusive and may be terminated at will by the entrant. The need to protect courts from the very real potential for violent incidents more than justifies the use of magnetometers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Sanctions - Frivolous Proceeding Challenging Courthouse Magnetometer Searches </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner attorney and his law firm are sanctioned pursuant to 22 NYCRR 130-1.1 for bringing a frivolous proceeding challenging the use of magnetometers at court buildings almost four years after the magnetometers were installed. Courthouse magnetometer searches are constitutionally reasonable searches to which entrants give their implied consent. Such procedures protect not only the judiciary and court personnel, but members of the Bar and the general public alike.  There was no bar to the courtroom and petitioner and his law firm did not comment upon any of the many Federal and New York cases regarding magnetometer searches in courtrooms and buildings.  Accordingly, sanctions are ordered in the amount of $ 500 against petitioner and $ 1,000 against his law firm to be paid to the Clients' Security Fund.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants stood accused of several crimes, including aggravated harassment in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.30(3) and the N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 40-c(2) following defendants' attack on two complainants. The case went before the court on defendants' motions to dismiss on free speech grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants allegedly approached the complainants, one defendant stated that they did not want any spics or niggers in the neighborhood, and defendants physically attacked the complainants. After defendants were formally accused of violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.30(3) and N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 40-c(2), defendants filed motions to dismiss the charges on the ground that the statutes violated defendants' First Amendment right to free speech. The court denied the motions on the ground that the challenged statutes did not violate the First Amendment and were a valid exercise of police power. The court held that the First Amendment's prohibition of the regulation of individual speech was not absolute. Speech could be regulated or prohibited if it served no useful purpose, and there was a compelling societal interest to prohibit it. The challenged statutes did not proscribe bias-related fighting words; rather, the statutes targeted defendants' physical actions. The proscribed behavior was distinguished from simple harassment, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.25(1), due to the added factor that the acts were committed because of bias toward the victims of the harassment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendants' motions to dismiss because the challenged statutes regarding aggravated harassment dealt with defendants' actions based on bias toward the victims and were a valid exercise of the state's police power. The court noted that First Amendment free speech rights were not absolute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Aggravated Harassment - Punishment of Bias-Related Activity </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aggravated harassment and antidiscrimination statutes (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [3]; Civil Rights Law &sect; 40-c), which both make it illegal to strike, shove, kick or otherwise subject another person to physical contact or attempt or threaten to do the same because of the &quot;race, color, religion or national origin of such person&quot;, do not violate the First Amendment and are a valid exercise of police power. Prosecution under the statutes is based on physical conduct and not on the mere use of bias- related &quot;fighting words&quot;.  The statutes do not make certain acts punishable because of the motive of the defendant but merely enhance the punishment for those acts because of the motive. The State has a legitimate interest in protecting the rights of victims and discouraging bias-related crimes.  Accordingly, defendants may lawfully be prosecuted under both statutes for punching and kicking complainants for bias-related reasons.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an infant and his parents (infant), sued defendants, a priest and the church that employed him, for the priest's alleged sexual molestation of the infant. Plaintiffs asserted claims of respondeat superior and negligent hiring against the church and &quot;clergy malpractice,&quot; in a variety of forms, against the priest. The priest and the church moved to dismiss the causes of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The infant sued the priest and the church that employed the priest (defendants) after the infant was allegedly sexually molested. In particular, the infant sued on the theories of, among others, clergy malpractice and negligence, outrageous conduct causing severe emotional distress to the infant, respondeat superior, negligent hiring, failure to evaluate periodically the priest's activities, and breach of trust. On defendants' motions to dismiss, the court: (1) dismissed the respondeat superior claim because there was no allegation or proof that the priest sexually molested the infant in furtherance of the church's interests; (2) dismissed the clergy malpractice and negligence claims because the priest's wrongful conduct constituted the intentional torts of assault and battery and therefore were not cognizable as claims in negligence; (3) sustained the breach of trust claim, rejecting defendants' contention that such a cause of action was barred by the First Amendment; (4) sustained the claim for negligent hiring and supervision because such a cause of action was valid if the infant could show that the church knew or should have known of the priest's sexual proclivities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the infant's causes of action for clergy malpractice and negligence because the priest's misconduct amounted to the intentional torts of assault and battery.

The church could be held liable for negligent hiring, breach of trust, and outrageous conduct.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negligence - Clergy Malpractice - Sexual Misconduct by Clergyman - Breach of Trust - Excessive Entanglement in Religious Matters </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Causes of action for clergy malpractice and negligence, predicated upon alleged sexual misconduct of defendant clergyman regarding the infant plaintiff, must be dismissed since defendant's wrongful conduct constituted the intentional torts of assault and battery and, thus, falls outside the ambit of actionable negligence.  However, plaintiffs state valid causes of action for breach or violation of trust. There is no constitutional impediment to such causes of action on the ground of excessive entanglement in religious matters since there is no evidence of any counseling relationship between defendant and the infant plaintiff, of which the sexual misconduct alleged was a part, such as might preclude an inquiry into the propriety of defendant's conduct as an excessive involvement in the philosophy of his religious community.  Since it is conduct, not creed, that underlies plaintiffs' actions, the First Amendment does not preclude such claims.  Furthermore, even if defendant's conduct had been within a counseling setting, the actions would not be dismissed on the ground of excessive entanglement where the misconduct charged is the sexual abuse of an infant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Religion - Liability of Religious Institutions for Sexual Misconduct of Clergyman </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The institutional religious defendants in this case involving the alleged sexual misconduct of a clergyman regarding the infant plaintiff can be held liable for negligent hiring and failing periodically to evaluate the clergyman's activities and are not cloaked with any immunity under the First Amendment. If plaintiffs establish that defendants placed the clergyman in contact with boys despite actual or constructive notice of the priest's perverted proclivities, the fact that the placement occurred in the course of internal administration of the religious units does not, on constitutional grounds, preclude holding the institutions accountable for their negligence in administration.  Likewise, causes of action against defendants based upon the outrageous conduct of the priest causing severe emotional distress should not be dismissed at this stage.  However, defendants may not be held vicariously liable for the alleged intentional sexual misconduct of the priest under the principle of respondeat superior in the absence of any evidence that the priest was acting in furtherance of his employers' interests.  </SPAN></P>

After the employee committed disciplinary violations in his new position, the employer issued a letter informing him of his right to a formal hearing. The employer then realized that it had erred in issuing the letter, because a formal hearing was not required for probationary employees. The employer issued a superseding letter two days later, informing the employee of his termination. The employee brought this action seeking a formal hearing and reinstatement. The employer filed a motion to dismiss, which the trial court granted. The court held that, pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 554, the employee's probationary status followed him to other civil servant positions within New York City agencies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitation of Actions - Four-Month Statute of Limitations - When Cause of Action Accrues - Notification of Agency Determination </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The four-month Statute of Limitations for a CPLR article 78 proceeding to review an agency determination ( CPLR 217) begins to run when the determination becomes final and binding--i.e., when petitioner is notified of the determination.  Accordingly, a claim in the amended petition in an article 78 proceeding challenging a &quot;Certificate of Approval&quot; issued by the New York City Personnel Director on April 22, 1991, which conditioned petitioner civil service employee's job transfer from the Department of Sanitation to the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) upon the completion of his probationary period, was timely asserted on April 17, 1992 where petitioner, who was terminated without a hearing on the basis of his probationary status, was not &quot;notified&quot; of the determination of the City Personnel Director until March 30, 1992, when he received a motion by TBTA to dismiss the petition challenging his termination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Termination of Employment - Effect of Transfer on Probationary Status </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) properly terminated petitioner's employment for disciplinary reasons without a formal hearing since petitioner's former permanent civil service status was lawfully altered by virtue of a stipulation signed by petitioner prior to his transfer from the New York City Department of Sanitation to the TBTA wherein he agreed to serve a one-year probationary period and to forgo other rights and privileges of a permanent civil servant as a condition to being reinstated to his former position following disciplinary proceedings.  Petitioner retained his probationary status upon his transfer since civil servants who are transferred from a New York City agency to the TBTA &quot;have the same status ... after transfer ... as they had under their original appointment&quot; (Public Authorities Law &sect; 554).  Furthermore, petitioner was notified that his transfer would be subject to the City Personnel Director's rules governing transfers, which provide that where, as here, a probationary employee voluntarily agrees to a transfer to avoid a layoff, the transfer is subject to the employee completing any probationary period then being served (13 RCNY, tit 59, Appendix A, rule 6.1.6).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Termination of Employment - Estoppel to Treat Employee as Probationary </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Where petitioner, an employee of the New York City Department of Sanitation who was on disciplinary probation, was transferred to the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) during the pendency of that probation, the fact that TBTA officials mistakenly told petitioner and his union representative that petitioner would have permanent civil service status at TBTA does not estop TBTA from treating petitioner as a probationary employee. The doctrine of equitable estoppel is unavailable to petitioner due to the absence of any detrimental reliance by petitioner on any of the mistaken assurances by TBTA.  In addition, petitioner had no right to be treated as a permanent civil servant until the expiration of the one-year probation and the doctrine of equitable estoppel cannot be used to create a right or place petitioner in a better position.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife entered into a separation agreement during their divorce proceeding but pursuant to the terms of the agreement it did not merge into the judgment of divorce. The husband filed a motion requesting that the amount of his monthly maintenance payments to the wife be reduced based on his premature retirement alleging the current amount of $ 1,000 per month would be an extreme hardship after his retirement, and that the Domestic Relations Law was in violation of the parties' constitutional right to contract. The court denied the husband's application for relief and ruled that the statute was unconstitutional as it pertained to the separation agreement surviving the parties' divorce decree because the statute substantially impaired the long-standing rights of parties to enter into private contracts, the law had a questionable public purpose because there was no significant and legitimate social purpose pertaining to the health, safety or welfare of its citizens which could be found to outweigh the parties' individual right to contract, and the law was not reasonably and narrowly tailored because it lacked any subjective guidelines for the term extreme hardship.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Husband and Wife - Separation Agreement - Modification - Unconstitutional Impairment of Private Contractual Rights </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Domestic Relations Law &sect; 236 (B) (9) (b), which permits modification of maintenance contained in a separation agreement that survives the divorce decree upon a showing of &quot;extreme prejudice&quot;, is unconstitutional as violative of the Contract Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 10, cl [1]) since it operates as a substantial impairment of the rights and obligations in private contracts without furthering a significant and legitimate social purpose beyond saving a party from having entered into a bad deal.  The law furthers no legitimate health, safety or welfare concerns which outweigh the parties' individual rights of contract.  In addition, the law is not reasonably and narrowly tailored since it lacks any subjective guidelines for &quot;extreme hardship&quot; as that term would relate to any legitimate and significant public purpose and it further fails to provide a framework limiting it to the public purpose which would permit such intrusion into private contracts.  Accordingly, plaintiff husband's claimed &quot;extreme hardship&quot; due to early retirement cannot serve as grounds for a downward modification of the monthly maintenance he is required to pay defendant pursuant to the terms of a separation agreement incorporated, but not merged, into the judgment of divorce. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant individual filed a motion to set aside the verdict finding defendant guilty of violating N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant individual was acquitted of two counts of aggravated harassment, but was found guilty of the violation of N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 40-c (2). Defendant argued that the jury's verdict of guilt was against the weight of the evidence, that the conviction under &sect; 40-c (2) was in violation of his first amendment rights under the constitution, and that the People failed to comply with the notification requirements under N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 40-d, requiring dismissal of count 3 of the information. The court found that the evidence adduced at trial was legally sufficient to establish defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, the court found that &sect; 40-c (2) withstood the constitutional scrutiny because violation of the statute was determined by defendant's conduct towards another. Defendant failed to support his contention that &sect; 40-c (2) was unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court denied motion to set aside defendant's conviction on constitutional grounds because defendant failed to support his contention that statute at issue was unconstitutionally overbroad, and to set aside verdict based upon credibility of evidence introduced at trial because evidence was legally sufficient to establish defendant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Verdict - Setting Verdict Aside - Verdict against Weight of Evidence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant may not have the jury verdict finding him guilty of making harassing telephone calls in violation of Civil Rights Law &sect; 40-c (2) set aside pursuant to CPL 330.30 on the ground that the guilty verdict is against the weight of the credible evidence adduced at trial since a trial court is not authorized to set aside a verdict on that ground.  Unlike an appellate court, a trial court may set aside a verdict pursuant to CPL 330.30 only in instances where the evidence is legally insufficient to support the verdict.  In this case, there was nothing so inherently contradictory or unbelievable in the People's proof as to require a finding of insufficiency as a matter of law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights - Discrimination in Public Accommodation - Harassing Telephone Calls Not Constitutionally Protected </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant was lawfully convicted of making harassing telephone calls to a specific individual in violation of Civil Rights Law &sect; 40-c (2), since his conduct was not constitutionally protected under the First Amendment. The statute withstands constitutional scrutiny since it does not on its face prohibit speech or impermissibly target conduct based upon its expressive content.  Rather, violation of the statute is determined not by the content of the person's speech, but by his or her conduct towards another.  ln addition, defendant has failed to establish that the statute is unconstitutionally overbroad. Furthermore, the People's failure to notify the Attorney-General of the commencement of the criminal proceeding against defendant does not require dismissal under Civil Rights Law &sect; 40-d since the notification requirement only applies when the person aggrieved commences a civil action to recover a penalty from the defendant.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioners, an industrial trade association made up of the owners and operators of solid waste management and recycling facilities, and the individual operators, lack standing to challenge, on environmental grounds, the enactment of a New York City local law (Local Laws, 1990, No. 40 of City of New York, amending Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 16-130 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> regulating waste transfer stations for recyclable materials.  The perceived environmental harms claimed are not different in kind or degree from those affecting the general community.  Petitioners' concerns as to the increase in their costs of doing business are economic, not environmental, and such concerns do not create standing to raise claims under State and City environmental review statutes.  Furthermore, the enactment of the law was a health emergency action exempt from environmental review requirements.  The lead agencies took the required &quot;hard look&quot; at the environmental consequences to support the issuance of a negative declaration of any adverse environmental impact.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Regulation of Waste Transfer Industry - Proper Exercise of Police Power </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A law enacted by the City of New York regulating waste transfer stations for recyclable materials (Local Laws, 1990, No. 40 of City of New York, amending Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 16-130 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> represents a proper exercise of the City's police power to regulate for reasons of health and public safety and is facially constitutional.  Petitioners, an industrial trade association made up of the owners and operators of solid waste management and recycling facilities, and the individual operators, have failed to establish that the notice and hearing procedures employed to enact the law were arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  Petitioners were in fact present and participated at the hearings.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Regulation of Waste Transfer Industry - &quot;As Applied&quot; Challenge - No Violation of Substantive Due Process </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A law enacted by the City of New York, placing administrative jurisdiction over all waste transfer stations for recyclable materials with the Department of Sanitation (DOS) and enhancing DOS's regulatory authority, including the right to promulgate regulations with regard to siting specifications (Local Laws, 1990, No. 40 of City of New York, amending Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 16-130 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">),</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not unconstitutional &quot;as applied&quot; to petitioners, an industrial trade association made up of the owners and operators of solid waste management and recycling facilities, and the individual operators, since the &quot;as applied&quot; challenge, which is dependent upon the regulations, is not ripe for determination and presents no justiciable controversy for a declaratory adjudication at this time prior to the adoption of any regulations. In addition, the law, on its face, does not violate substantive due process since it is reasonably related to the legitimate governmental objective of improving the health, safety and general welfare of the public by shifting administrative responsibility.  The law is a reasonable exercise of police power in an area that has long been subject to regulation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Regulation of Waste Transfer Industry - No Violation of Operators' Equal Protection Rights </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A law enacted by the City of New York, placing administrative jurisdiction over all waste transfer stations for recyclable materials with the Department of Sanitation (DOS) and enhancing DOS's regulatory authority, including the right to promulgate regulations with regard to siting specifications (Local Laws, 1990, No. 40 of City of New York, amending Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 16-130 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">),</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not deny equal protection to petitioners, an industrial trade association made up of the owners and operators of solid waste management and recycling facilities, and the individual operators, since the City, in lawfully exercising its police power, may validly address the environmental concerns of the waste transfer industry separate from other industries that may impact upon the environment.  Such disparate treatment of other classes does not give rise to complaint for a deprivation of equal protection. The placement of the entire waste transfer industry under one coherent scheme of regulation should, if anything, promote equal protection. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Regulation of Waste Transfer Industry - No Unconstitutional Taking </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A law enacted by the City of New York, placing administrative jurisdiction over all waste transfer stations for recyclable materials with the Department of Sanitation (DOS) and enhancing DOS's regulatory authority, including the right to promulgate regulations with regard to siting specifications (Local Laws, 1990, No. 40 of City of New York, amending Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 16-130 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">),</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not unconstitutionally deprive owners of transfer stations of the right to continue to operate their businesses and use their properties in an economically viable manner.  The law, on its face, does not prohibit transfer station operations in certain zones where such operations are now permitted but merely authorizes DOS to adopt siting regulations. A &quot;possible taking&quot; which might occur in the future when the regulations are adopted is not equivalent to a taking at this time.  Moreover, petitioners do not have immunity against the valid exercise of the City's police power merely because their businesses were originally established in full compliance with then existing laws.  While the new regulatory scheme may eventually increase the cost of doing business, that does not render it invalid.  Furthermore, since petitioners have not provided any proof that previously issued permits were prematurely retired by the new legislation, they have not demonstrated a taking on this ground.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Regulation of Waste Transfer Industry - No Improper Delegation of Authority to Administrative Agency </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A law enacted by the City of New York placing administrative jurisdiction over all waste treatment stations for recyclable materials with the Department of Sanitation (DOS) and enhancing DOS's regulatory authority (Local Laws, 1990, No. 40 of City of New York, amending Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 16-130 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">),</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not improperly delegate responsibility to DOS without providing statutory standards for the exercise of its discretion.  The law's requirements that applicants produce such information as DOS determines &quot;to be necessary for the department to fulfill its duties&quot;, including &quot;financial statements&quot; and &quot;any annual or quarterly report&quot; required to be filed, provides a sufficient framework and standard for DOS to follow.  The statutory provision empowering DOS to rescind an order sealing, securing or closing premises or equipment when the operator provides DOS with &quot;assurances that the conditions which caused the issuance of such order have been corrected and will not reoccur&quot;, likewise provides DOS with a specific standard to follow.  Moreover, clear limits are set on the conduct of DOS in issuing exemptions regarding enclosure of putrescible waste transfer stations. Furthermore, the law does not constitute an improper delegation of authority as to enforcement and penalties since fines and penalties are imposed by adjudicatory bodies, not DOS.  In the area of enforcement, it is customary and usual for the legislative body, as here, to leave to the adjudicatory body discretion in imposing penalties as the circumstances warrant within a particular range of choices.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Regulation of Waste Transfer Industry - Void for Vagueness Analysis </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. A law enacted by the City of New York placing administrative jurisdiction over all waste transfer stations for recyclable materials with the Department of Sanitation (DOS) and enhancing DOS's regulatory authority (Local Laws, 1990, No. 40 of City of New York, amending Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 16-130 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">),</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not void for vagueness since the broad and flexible standards and policies set forth in the law provide sufficient guidelines for the exercise of agency discretion.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Regulation of Waste Transfer Industry - No Violation of Due Process Right to Privacy for Having to Provide Administrative Agency with Business Records - Trade Secrets </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. A law enacted by the City of New York placing all administrative jurisdiction over waste transfer stations for recyclable material with the Department of Sanitation (DOS) and enhancing DOS's regulatory authority (Local Laws, 1990, No. 40 of City of New York, amending Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 16-130 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">),</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not violate any due process right to privacy by requiring station operators to provide DOS with their business records, which may then be disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information Law request, since there is little or no expectation of privacy in business records in such an extensively regulated industry, especially for documents prepared in compliance with regulatory requirements.  Moreover, trade secrets obtained in the course of regulatory compliance are exempt from disclosure to the public in any event (Public Officers Law &sect; 87 [2] [d]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Regulation of Waste Transfer Industry - Valid Criminal Sanctions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The criminal sanctions imposed for illegal waste transfer station operations in the City of New York, making a violation of the statute (Local Laws, 1990, No. 40 of City of New York, amending Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 16-130 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment of up to one year, a fine not to exceed $ 25,000 and impoundment and forfeiture of property and equipment used in the commission of a crime, are not grossly disproportionate to the nature of the offense so as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  The penalties are all within the limits of comparable regulatory structures on the State and Federal levels for conduct detrimental to the public health and safety.  In addition, the impoundment procedures provide for a timely postdeprivation hearing within three business days and are thus not violative of due process.  </SPAN></P>

Defendants, the state department of taxation and its commissioner, sought summary judgment by cross-action, seeking a declaration that the CMSA did not constitute a resale price-fixing scheme contrary to federal law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wholesaler had unsuccessfully sought administrative relief in an attempt to establish that its cost of doing business was in fact lower than the statutorily presumed rate provided for in the CMSA. In the declaratory action, the wholesaler alleged that the CMSA was in conflict with the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, and therefore, unconstitutional pursuant to the Supremacy Clause. Defendants argued that the CMSA was immune from federal anti-trust provisions under the state action doctrine set forth in Parker. The court agreed with defendants and found that the CMSA satisfied both prongs of the state action exemption requirement. First, the court found that the enabling provision of the CMSA, which provided that regulation of the sales prices of cigarettes was required for the purpose of stabilizing the industry within the state, satisfied the first prong that required that the economic restraint was part of a state policy. The court next found that the second prong was satisfied in that the state department of taxation actively supervised the CMSA. Accordingly, the court found that the CMSA was exempt from the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the wholesaler's motion for summary judgment and granted defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment to the extent that they were entitled to a declaration that the CMSA did not constitute a resale price fixing scheme contrary to federal law. The court ordered defendants' counsel to submit an order and judgment in conformance therewith.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved to dismiss all of the counts on the ground that those sections of the N.Y. Penal Law were preempted by federal copyright law. The court dismissed three counts that were charged under N.Y.

However, the remaining four counts that were charged under N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Offenses Relating to Unauthorized Recording - Preemption by Federal Copyright Law </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, the owner of three video stores, may not be prosecuted under State law for advertisement or sale of unauthorized recordings in the first and second degrees (Penal Law &sect;&sect; 275.25, 275.30) based upon his having rented to the public unauthorized recordings of videocassettes without the copyright owner's consent since the State statutes as applied in this case have been preempted by Federal copyright law. A State regulation or statute is preempted if the rights covered are &quot;equivalent&quot; to any of those exclusive rights &quot;within the general scope of copyright ... in works of authorship that ... come within the subject matter of copyright&quot; (17 USC &sect; 301 [a]).  Sections 275.25 and 275.30 deal exclusively with matters related to distribution and thus contain &quot;equivalent&quot; rights covered exclusively by Federal copyright law. Furthermore, the videocassettes at issue come within the Federal subject matter of copyright (17 USC &sect; 102 [a] [6]).  However, defendant may properly be prosecuted for failure to disclose the origin of a recording in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 275.35) and criminal possession of a forged instrument in the third degree (Penal Law &sect; 170.20).  The rights being affected by those consumer protection statutes are not &quot;equivalent&quot; rights &quot;within the general scope of copyright&quot;; moreover, those statutes are not copyright infringement statutes by nature and have no effect on the congressional objective of national uniformity of copyright law. </SPAN></P>

Defendants moved to dismiss the indictments on numerous grounds.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Eavesdropping Warrants - Standing to Challenge Warrant </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the prosecution of defendants for engaging in a criminal enterprise to secretly manipulate the over-the-counter stock market in which evidence was obtained by wiretapping, only those defendants whose conversations were overheard and intercepted have standing to challenge the initial warrant and subsequent extensions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Eavesdropping Warrants - Necessity for Electronic Eavesdropping </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the prosecution of defendants for engaging in a criminal enterprise to secretly manipulate the over-the-counter stock market, the People have adequately demonstrated that electronic eavesdropping was an appropriate method of investigation as provided in CPL 700.15 (4) and 700.20 (2) (d).  There is no statutory requirement that wiretapping be only the last resort or that all other imaginable means of investigation have been absolutely and completely exhausted.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Eavesdropping Warrants - Amendment of Warrants - Enterprise Corruption </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the criminal prosecution of defendants for engaging in a criminal enterprise to secretly manipulate the over-the-counter stock market in which evidence was obtained by wiretapping pursuant to warrants seeking evidence of securities fraud and related crimes, the failure of the People to amend the warrants to specify enterprise corruption (Penal Law &sect; 460.10 [3]) as a target crime does not preclude the use of the intercepted conversations to prove that crime.  Although the crime of enterprise corruption is not an approved designated offense for purposes of obtaining an eavesdropping warrant (CPL 700.30 [4]; 700.05 [8]), such offense is within the ambit of the crimes sought to be discovered in the surveillance. Accordingly, the crime of enterprise corruption was &quot;otherwise sought&quot; in the eavesdropping warrants within the meaning of the retrospective amendment procedure of CPL 700.65 (4) and amendment was thus not required.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Enterprise Corruption - Constitutionality of Enterprise Corruption Statute&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. New York's enterprise corruption statute, which proscribes acting with intent to participate in or advance the affairs of a &quot;criminal enterprise&quot; having a &quot;structure and criminal purpose beyond the scope of individual criminal incidents&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 460.10 [3]), is not unconstitutionally vague.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Enterprise Corruption - What Constitutes Criminal Enterprise </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Defendants, independent securities firms and individuals, were properly charged with enterprise corruption for allegedly engaging in a &quot;criminal enterprise&quot; to secretly manipulate the over-the-counter stock market, where the evidence presented to the Grand Jury established: that the otherwise discrete and independent defendants acted together to manipulate securities on an ongoing basis; that defendants' unlawful purpose was to profit from their manipulative market tactics; that while not all defendants were involved in every deal, there was a continuing structure and purpose; and that there existed an enterprise with an ascertainable structure distinct from a pattern of criminal conduct, including a system of authority beyond what is minimally necessary to effectuate individual substantive criminal offenses.  Moreover, the enterprise corruption statute was not intended to apply only to the &quot;Mafia&quot; but, rather, was also intended to cover the type of &quot;ordinary white collar crimes&quot; involved in this case.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the union officers and others, filed suit against defendants, the comptroller and others, seeking a declaration that 1990 N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Common Retirement Fund (CRF) held the assets and income of certain retirement systems. Previously, comptrollers used the aggregate cost method as the actuarial funding method to determine annual contributions to be made by public employers to the CRF. Thereafter, the legislature enacted 1990 N.Y. Laws 210 which mandated changing the actuarial funding method from the aggregate cost method to the projected unit credit method. Studies projected that the amount required to be contributed to the CRF by public employers would increase dramatically. The union officers and others then commenced the instant action seeking a declaration that 1990 N.Y. Laws 210 was unconstitutional. The court found that one of the contract benefits public employees acquired as a result of N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 7 was the right to an independent trustee imbued with the discretion to protect their retirement funds. 1990 N.Y. Laws 210 was an unconstitutional attempt to divest public employees of that contract right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the union officers and others' motions for summary judgment and denied the cross motions for summary judgment filed by the comptroller and others.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Retirement and Pension Benefits - Unconstitutional Impairment of Retirement Benefits - Change in Actuarial Funding Method Used to Calculate Employer Contributions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapter 210 of the Laws of 1990, which requires the State Comptroller, as trustee of the Common Retirement Fund (CRF), to change the actuarial funding method for determining the annual contributions to be made by public employers to the CRF from the fiscally conservative aggregate cost method, which has been employed since 1921 and has resulted in a surplus in the CRF in excess of $ 7 billion, to the projected unit credit method, which would reduce or eliminate public employer contributions to the CRF for a 10-year period by expending the surplus in the CRF, is unconstitutional as violative of the constitutional amendment, effective after July 1, 1940, which makes membership in any pension or retirement system of the State a contractual relationship, &quot;the benefits of which shall not be diminished or impaired&quot; (NY Const, art V, &sect; 7).  A contract benefit acquired by public employees as a result of the constitutional amendment was the right to an independent trustee imbued with the discretion to protect their retirement funds.  Chapter 210 is an unconstitutional attempt to divest public employees of that contract right. The diversion of accumulated pension funds of public employees to meet a present fiscal crisis by reducing the contributions of public employers in order to avoid raising taxes or cutting other programs is precisely the type of conduct the constitutional amendment was designed to prevent. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The international bank paid its end of the currency swap to the foreign bank's office in London. The international bank never received what it was owed by the foreign bank. The international bank argued that &sect; 606 was unconstitutional. First, the international bank argued that &sect; 606 unfairly favored creditors of the state agency of the foreign bank by giving them preferred access to the foreign bank's assets. In denying the application, the court held that &sect; 606 did not give preference to in-state creditors over residents elsewhere; instead, the statute prioritized between creditors whose claims arose out of business done with the foreign bank's state agency, whether the creditor resided in the state or not. The international bank also argued that &sect; 606 unlawfully discriminated among creditors by creating a preferred group of creditors, those of the foreign bank's state agency, and a disfavored group, those of the foreign bank. The court held that the statutory scheme was not arbitrary or irrational because the state was balancing the need to attract foreign banks for business purposes and the desire to protect those that dealt with foreign banks in the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks and Banking - Liquidation - Constitutionality of Liquidation Procedures Regarding New York Agency of Foreign Bank </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liquidation procedures of Banking Law &sect; 606 are not unconstitutional to the extent that they give a preference to claims of creditors of a New York Agency of a failed foreign bank over claims of creditors against other out-of-State branches of the foreign bank. The statutory scheme is a rational and balanced system for the regulation of foreign banking that does not directly or indirectly unconstitutionally give preference to New York creditors over out-of-State creditors.  The distinction drawn by the statute between creditors whose claims arise out of business done with the foreign bank's New York Agency, whether they reside in New York or not, and those whose claims arise out of dealings with the bank or its branches elsewhere, is not arbitrary or irrational but, rather, furthers the legitimate State interest of insuring that those who deal with foreign banks in this State, whatever their citizenship, are protected.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicants requested Emergency Home Relief (EHR) grants to pay amounts due so they could retain their homes. Defendant, the acting commissioner of the New York State Department of Social Services (DSS), denied the applications because the applicants' income exceeded 125 percent of the Federal income poverty line, a ceiling prescribed by a recent amendment to the regulations governing the EHR program. The applicants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The EHR program provided assistance to New York residents with emergency needs who were ineligible for assistance under any other state program. Under EHR, applicants could receive one-time emergency assistance payments if they were facing eviction for nonpayment of rent and they did not qualify for Federal assistance. In order to contain costs, DSS adopted a monetary guideline capping eligibility for EHR at 125 percent of the Federal poverty level on the theory that families that had income above that level should be able to plan for emergencies. The applicants sought to have the amendment declared invalid on the grounds that it was irrational and unconstitutional, and that, as an emergency regulation, it was illegally promulgated. On appeal, the court held that the amendment was unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement. The court held that the amendment was arbitrary because it was not based on any empirical study, analysis, or report, and denied assistance to residents in need. The court deferred ruling on the applicants' request to certify the action as a class action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court invalidated the DSS amendment that capped eligibility for Emergency Home Relief at 125 percent of the Federal poverty level and enjoined its enforcement.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An amendment to the regulations governing the Emergency Home Relief program (EHR), which limits eligibility for one-time assistance payments to persons otherwise ineligible for welfare whose household incomes do not exceed 125% of the current Federal income official poverty line (18 NYCRR 370.3 [b] [2]), is invalidated and its enforcement is enjoined.  The determination by defendant Department of Social Services that its bright-line income test meaningfully distinguishes between worthy and unworthy EHR recipients lacks any empirical basis and is thus impermissibly arbitrary.  In addition to the absence of any factual underpinning, defendant's theory that EHR applicants with incomes exceeding the monetary guideline should have been able to pay rent arrears and other emergency needs is irrational on its face.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlords sought summary judgment in its suit for a declaration that the enforcement of rent stabilization laws, &sect; 5(a)(11) of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act and N.Y. City Admin. Code &sect; 26-504(a)(1)(f), was an unconstitutional taking. Defendant tenant filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and a motion to amend its answer to plead estoppel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlords leased apartments to the tenant, a not-for-profit hospital, for the use of the tenant's employees. The landlords sent notices of nonrenewal. A new law did not require a landlord to offer renewal to a tenant who was not using the apartment as his primary residence. To protect entities such as the tenant, the statutes in question were amended to state that the tenant would be the primary tenant. The primary tenant then had the right to sublet without the landlord's consent. The trial court denied the motion to amend because the amendment was without merit since estoppel was not a bar to the landlords' action. The enforcement of the new rules was not an unconstitutional physical or regulatory taking under the Fifth Amendment since the landlords voluntarily agreed to open their premises. The landlords were not compelled to become landlords, and they could sell the premises if they desired to be free of any tenancies. The public policy of curbing rent profiteering by landlords and providing housing provided a legitimate state interest favoring enforcement. The landlords also failed to establish that they were denied the economic viable use of the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Leave to amend was denied. Otherwise, summary judgment was granted to the tenant. The enforcement of rent stabilization laws was neither a physical nor or a regulatory taking of the landlords' property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - Renewal Lease - Constitutionality of Statute Mandating Renewal Leases to Not-For-Profit Hospitals Which Sublet Apartments to Employees - Physical or Regulatory Taking </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs, the owners of the subject apartment building, must offer renewal leases to defendant hospital for six rent-stabilized apartments occupied by hospital employees.  Chapter 940 of the Laws of 1984, which amended the Rent Stabilization Law so as to require landlords to provide renewal leases to not-for-profit hospitals based on the primary residency status of the hospital's employee-subtenant, rather than on the primary residency status of the tenant of record (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 26-504 [a] [1] [f]; &sect; 26-511 [c] [12]), does not constitute an unconstitutional physical taking of property without just compensation.  Plaintiffs have failed to show the loss in perpetuity of their reversionary interest in their property or that the statute requires them to refrain in perpetuity from terminating a tenancy. Since plaintiffs voluntarily opened their property to occupancy by others, they cannot assert a per se right to compensation based on their inability to exclude particular individuals.  Furthermore, plaintiffs have not demonstrated that any of the avenues of changing the use of their property have been closed to them or that they are not in fact free to change the use of their land.  In addition, the statute does not effect a regulatory taking, since it promotes the purposes of the Rent Stabilization Law, and does not deny them the full use of their property or a reasonable return on their investment.  </SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs and defendants, Commissioner of the New York State Division of Housing and Community and city, sought summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs owned and occupied different parts of a building which at the time of purchase contained units subject to rent control. Plaintiffs challenged the laws which prevented them from evicting, for family use of the property, two unrelated tenants each of whom had a rent-controlled unit which each had occupied for more than 20 years. The court held that nothing that the plaintiffs alleged rose to a violation of the Involuntary Servitude Clause of the Thirteenth Amendment. The indefinite tenancies did not amount to a physical taking of property. The protection for tenants of 20 years or more against removal to meet a landlord's desires for personal use did not amount to an impermissible over-regulation or &quot;regulatory taking.&quot; The court found plaintiffs' arguments that the challenged provisions did not advance legitimate state interests because they were either superfluous, vague or too broad, to be entirely without merit. Inasmuch as the court found that there was no physical taking of plaintiffs' property, and the challenged provisions substantially advanced legitimate state interests, it found that there had been no violation of plaintiffs' due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York City's tenant protection provisions, which prohibit an owner from recovering possession of a rent-controlled housing accommodation for personal or family use from a long-term tenant who has occupied the unit for more than 20 years (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 26-408 [b] [1]; New York City Rent and Eviction Regulations [9 NYCRR] &sect; 2204.5 [a]), substantially advance legitimate State interests in protecting long-term tenants who have roots in the community from the devastating impact of evictions and do not constitute an unconstitutional physical taking of private property without just compensation.  The challenged provisions do not constitute an involuntary servitude by forcing owners to continue in the rental business. The owners are not being forced to subject their properties to a use not otherwise planned or intended in the first instance.  Furthermore, the protection of long-term tenants against removal to meet a landlord's desires for personal use does not constitute an impermissible over-regulation or &quot;regulatory taking&quot; since owners are not deprived of the economically viable use of their properties.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to set aside his plea agreement and sentence on the grounds that the statute that lead to a search of his business that discovered illegal drugs had been declared unconstitutional subsequent to his plea and sentencing. The state argued that defendant had entered into a binding plea agreement and had waived his right to appeal with full knowledge of the then pending constitutional challenge to the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's business was searched under N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 415-a(5)(a), which authorized police inspection of junkyards and related businesses as part of their licensing requirements; during the search illegal drugs were found. Defendant's challenge to &sect;415-a(5)(a)'s constitutionality was denied and the evidence was not suppressed. Defendant then entered a plea agreement on the drug charges and expressly waived his right to appeal with full knowledge that statute was being challenged in other cases. When the statute was ruled unconstitutional, defendant sought to set aside his plea and sentence. The court held that the plea was binding, especially as defendant was convicted on a statute other than the one declared unconstitutional. The court held that the fact that constitutional rights were implicated did not preclude enforcement of a waiver of the right to appeal or was a jurisdictional defect that barred a lawful waiver of appellate rights. To permit a plea to be withdrawn after the very uncertainty which served as the basis for the bargain was ultimately resolved in defendant's favor would render plea bargains, so vital to the criminal justice system, useless.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Where defendant, whose arrest was predicated on an administrative search of his business premises pursuant to Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 415-a and the recovery of numerous stolen automobile parts, agreed to waive his right to appeal as part of a negotiated plea bargain at a time when defense counsel knew that the Court of Appeals was considering the constitutionality of section 415-a, defendant's intelligent and voluntary waiver must be enforced even though the statute was subsequently held unconstitutional, and his convictions will not be set aside.  Only those jurisdictional issues which actually concern a defendant's actual guilt of the crimes charged or those which go to the very right of the State to hold a trial act as a bar to waiver.  No such jurisdictional impediment exists in this case where the subdivision of the statute found unconstitutional (&sect; 415-a [5] [a]) served merely as the predicate to obtain the evidence against defendant but was not the section under which defendant was actually charged. Furthermore, defendant's convictions should not be vacated in the interests of justice since the unconstitutionality of the statute dealt solely with the right to search defendant's premises and did not address defendant's actual guilt of the crimes charged. </SPAN></P>

In a criminal proceeding in which defendant negotiated a plea bargain, the imposition of a lesser sentence than the one originally agreed upon resulting from the modification of defendant's sentence from consecutive to concurrent terms of probation as required by statute (Penal Law &sect; 65.15 [1]), did not serve to breach the plea agreement so as to require vacatur of his conviction.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state moved to reduce the charge against defendant of criminal contempt in the second degree to attempted criminal contempt in the second degree in one docket, and to reduce the charge against defendant of aggravated harassment in the second degree to attempted aggravated harassment in the second degree in another docket. Defendant opposed the motion, and demanded a jury trial on all charges pending against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two dockets, defendant was charged with various crimes including: criminal mischief, aggravated harassment, assault, and criminal contempt. With respect to the state's motion to reduce the charges of criminal contempt and aggravated harassment to attempts, the court ruled that the reduction was acceptable. In so ruling, the court rejected defendant's argument that attempted criminal contempt and attempted aggravated harassment were hypothetical crimes which could not be committed. The court explained that both criminal contempt and aggravated harassment were intentional crimes, and that both could be unsuccessfully attempted. The court also ruled that defendant's request for a jury trial was premature because the two dockets had not yet been consolidated, and no single charge carried a penalty of more than six months in prison. Consequently, defendant was not entitled to a jury trial pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 340.40(2). In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on a line of cases that found that a defendant charged with multiple petty offenses was not entitled to a jury trial where, as here, the charges stemmed from unrelated incidents.</SPAN></P>

In order to constitute an attempt, it must first be established that the defendant acted with a specific intent (Penal Law &sect; 110.00).

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An information charging defendant with disorderly conduct (Penal Law &sect; 240.20 [7]) for &quot;holding up an apparent aborted fetus&quot; at a public demonstration and the supporting deposition stating that defendant placed what &quot;he said to be a live fetus&quot; &quot;close&quot; to the faces of bystanders satisfy the pleading requirements of CPL 100.15 and 100.40 as to facial sufficiency. The disorderly conduct charge is not unconstitutionally applied in this case as to abridge defendant's rights of free speech and assembly since the statute does attempt to restrict the substance of the speech, but instead attempts to protect the health, safety or well-being of the public from a form of communication that may violate those interests; nor was defendant unconstitutionally singled out and denied equal protection of the law since other persons who were not arrested used methods protected by the First Amendment in merely voicing their opinions and distributing literature. However, the disorderly conduct charge must be dismissed since Penal Law &sect; 240.20 (7), which proscribes creating &quot;a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which serves no legitimate purpose&quot; with &quot;intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm&quot;, is unconstitutionally vague on its face; the statute does not sufficiently define the prohibited conduct of creating a &quot;physically offensive condition&quot; so as to give notice to ordinary intelligent people as to what is proscribed by the statute.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, firefighters and their association, sought a declaration that N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect;&sect;50-a and 50(7) were unconstitutional and moved for summary judgment. Sections 50-a and 50(7) set up a review procedure for challenging answers to civil service examinations and limited court review to issues of whether procedures were followed. Defendants, the city and its department of personnel's director, cross-moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' action was commenced after two firefighters failed a civil service exam. They alleged that they could not challenge the test answers due to the operation of &sect;&sect; 50(7) and 50-a. Plaintiffs argued that &sect;&sect;50-a and 50(7) were unconstitutional because they violated the constitutional guarantee of competitive examination under N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6, and denied civil service employees equal protection and due process. Defendants argued that the action was time-barred. The court held that because an article 78 proceeding was not the appropriate method to challenge the constitutionality of a legislative enactment, plaintiffs' attempt to strike &sect;&sect; 50(7) and 50-a as being unconstitutional was not subject to the four-month time bar established for the proceedings. The court held that the procedures set forth in &sect; 50-a did not meet the merit and fitness requirement of the New York Constitution because it failed to give candidates, who under the proposed answer key correctly answered a question, notice that the answer was being changed. The court directed that plaintiffs be permitted to show that their test answers were as good or better than the answer key ultimately chosen.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that one of the challenged sections of the law was unconstitutional and directed that a referee be appointed to give plaintiffs the opportunity to show that the answers they selected on the civil service exam were as good or better than the answer key ultimately used to grade their exams.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitation of Actions - Four-Month Statute of Limitations - Review Procedures for Challenging Key Answers to New York City Civil Service Examinations </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The action by plaintiffs, commenced December 22, 1987, challenging the constitutionality of the review procedures for protesting key answers to New York City civil service examinations (Civil Service Law &sect;&sect; 50-a, 50 [7]), in connection with the 1986 civil service examination for the position of fire department lieutenant and the resulting final eligible list promulgated on August 5, 1987, is not subject to the four-month time bar established for CPLR article 78 proceedings ( CPLR 217).  While this action arises out of specific actions taken by the Test Validation Board (TVB) in rejecting answers which had initially been designated as correct, the underlying challenge is to the constitutionality of the review procedures and an article 78 proceeding is not the appropriate method to challenge the constitutionality of a legislative enactment. However, plaintiffs' request for the creation of a special eligible list in the event they can establish that their answers were equally correct to ones chosen by the TVB is governed by the four-month limitations period, running from date subsequent to the promulgation of the eligible list when they learned of the changes made by the TVB.  Under the circumstances, there is an issue of fact that must be decided by a Referee as to the date upon which plaintiffs were permitted to review the final key answers and thereby became aggrieved by the actions of the TVB.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The action by plaintiffs, commenced December 22, 1987, challenging the constitutionality of the review procedures for protesting key answers to New York City civil service examinations, in connection with the 1986 civil service examination for the position of fire department lieutenant, should not be dismissed on the ground of laches in the absence of any showing of prejudice by the City, which, if it believed that passage of time was affecting the reliability of the examination, could have moved for summary judgment or served a demand on plaintiffs to prosecute the action.  In addition, the action should not be dismissed for failure to join necessary parties in view of the limited relief requested by plaintiffs in seeking the creation of a special eligible list if they can establish that their answers were equally correct as the key answers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Examinations - Constitutionality of Review Procedures for Challenging Key Answers to New York City Civil Service Examinations </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Civil Service Law &sect; 50-a, which establishes the review procedures for challenging key answers to New York City civil service examinations, is unconstitutional as violative of the merit and fitness requirement (NY Const, art V, &sect; 6) since the review procedures fail to give candidates who, under the proposed answer key correctly answered a question, notice that the Test Validation Board (TVB) is changing an answer.  The failure to give notice deprives aggrieved candidates of an opportunity to contest the changes before a final answer key is established.  The inability to contest the changes at the administrative level coupled with the circumscribed judicial review under Civil Service Law &sect; 50 (7), pursuant to which review is limited to whether established procedures have been followed and aggrieved candidates are precluded from challenging the correctness of the final answers, renders section 50-a&nbsp;unconstitutional since the procedures can result in civil service determinations that are not made in accordance with merit and fitness. Furthermore, since plaintiffs were not given an opportunity to show why the answers they selected on the 1986 civil service examination for fire department lieutenant were as good or better than the answer key ultimately chosen by the TVB, Civil Service Law &sect; 50 (7) must be deemed unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner development company sought a judgment pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 that respondent village unlawfully refused to issue a building permit and asserted that the section of the zoning law relied on by the village was void as beyond the delegated zoning powers of the municipality, unconstitutional on its face, and arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company's application for a building permit was denied under a local zoning law that refused permits to any owner who had not paid in full certain debts or charges related to the property involved in the application. The village and the company had a longstanding dispute over charges the village claimed were due for work it had done in the area of the company's property. The permit was denied because of these charges. The company filed a petition asserting that the village had exceeded the powers delegated to it under state law when it enacted the zoning law. The court agreed and held that the law was ultra vires and void. The court first found that the denial of the permit was motivated by the desire of the village to obtain payment on the claim arising out of the unrelated transaction and that this debt had no connection with the use of the property or with any zoning function delegated to the village under N.Y. Village Law &sect;&sect; 7-700, 7-704. The court concluded that the zoning law, to the extent it required the denial of permits based on an extraneous quarrel with the company, was inconsistent with state law because it invoked powers not delegated by the Village Law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the company a judgment directing the village to issue a permit and declaring the provisions of the ordinance at issue ultra vires and void.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law - Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a CPLR article 78 proceeding to annul a determination of respondent village denying petitioner a building permit to renovate space within petitioner's existing shopping mall, petitioner is not required to exhaust administrative remedies under the local zoning law before pursuing its claim that respondent lacks any power to condition the issuance of a building permit upon prior payment of a claim which is unrelated to accepted zoning factors and criteria affecting the use of such property.  Petitioner should not be compelled to seek administrative relief from a determination which, if petitioner's claim is correct, is void </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">ab initio.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Zoning - Authority of Village to Condition Grant of Permit upon Payment of Extraneous Debt </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A village zoning law provision which requires a property owner to satisfy extraneous debts as a condition precedent to the issuance of a building permit is ultra vires and void. Accordingly, petitioner, whose application for a building permit to renovate space in its existing shopping mall was denied pursuant to that zoning law provision, based upon petitioner's failure to satisfy respondent village's pending claim for reimbursement of construction costs incurred to improve roadways located on petitioner's property, is entitled to judgment directing respondent to issue the permit. The Village Law contains no express or implied grant of power to impose zoning conditions which are based upon extraneous disputes with owners of property, and imposition of such conditions by the village zoning law is inconsistent with the scheme of general State law because it invokes powers not delegated by the Village Law. Moreover, the village zoning law provision does not lawfully supersede the Village Law insofar as the latter omits any express or implied power to so condition the granting of permits, since respondent did not invoke its power of supersession under Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 (1) (ii) (e) (3) and did not comply with Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 22 (1).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent teachers' association demanded arbitration over whether petitioner board of education could be compelled to reinstate its practice of paying salaries in which the first check of the beginning of the school year included a sum for services not yet performed. Board of education filed a request to stay arbitration and asserted that the former practice violated N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 and N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3015.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Change in practice by board of education did not affect the total salary paid to teachers, but only the timing of payments. The court rejected board of education's argument that the practice would necessarily violate the constitutional prohibition against gifts of public monies or the loaning of any money in aid of any individual. The court held that because the teachers were legally obligated under their employment contracts to perform their services in the future and would have performed part of the expected service at the time of receiving their first check, the prepayment of a fraction of their salary did not constitute a gift and that the teachers' good-faith obligation to perform the contract was sufficient consideration to support the prepayment of the part of the salary. However, the court found that the matter could not be subjected to arbitration because &sect; 3015 prohibited the practice and represented a strong public policy that was not arbitrable. The court stated that the underlying purpose of the law was to avoid the problems that may arise on the death, retirement, resignation, or dismissal of a teacher during a period when the teacher has been prepaid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the board of education's petition for a stay of arbitration over the issue of discontinuing the practice of prepaying a portion of teachers' salary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arbitration - Matters Arbitrable - Prepayment of Teacher Salaries - No Arbitration on Public Policy Grounds </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public policy forbids arbitration of the question whether petitioner school district should be compelled to reinstate its prior practice of prepaying teacher salaries for services not yet rendered in the teachers' first paychecks in September.  Even though an award by an arbitrator directing prepayment for services not yet rendered would not necessarily violate the constitutional prohibition against gifts of public moneys (NY Const, art VIII, &sect; 1), inasmuch as the implicit obligation to perform coupled with the contractual promise to be in attendance over the life span of the agreement provides sufficient consideration to support the prepayment of part of a teacher's salary, any arbitration award directing prepayment of teacher salaries would violate the explicit statutory prohibition against such practice (Education Law &sect; 3015 [3]).  The controversy involves a matter of substance, not mere procedural safeguards, and public policy considerations, embodied in the statute, prohibit, &quot;in an absolute sense&quot;, the particular matter posed for arbitration from being decided against petitioner.  Accordingly, petitioner's motion to stay arbitration is granted.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rent Stabilization Law &sect; 26-511 (c) (9) (b) (Administrative Code of City of New York, tit 26, ch 4) which permits the nonrenewal of leases of rent-stabilized tenants in a garden apartment complex on the ground of personal use occupancy where the complex is converted into individual units, each as a one, two or four-family house, and then sold to individuals, does not deprive the tenants of equal protection of the laws on the ground that General Business Law &sect; 352-eeee (2) (c) (ii) and Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) &sect; 2524.4 (a) (1) prohibit the eviction on owner occupancy grounds of rent-stabilized tenants of buildings that have been converted pursuant to noneviction plans into cooperative or condominium ownership. In view of the magnitude of the potential displacement of rent-stabilized tenants from buildings converted to cooperative or condominium ownership during the 1980's the Legislature could have rationally concluded that the possibility of undue harm to that class of rent-stabilized tenants was greater than for all other rent-stabilized tenants and that it warranted a special exemption from the owner-occupancy provisions of section 26-511 (c) (9) (b).  In contrast, it is conceivable that the Legislature could have reasonably concluded that the physical alteration of garden apartments into individual houses did not pose a threat to the public interest and general welfare in the same magnitude as the threat posed to stabilized tenancies by the steady increase of cooperative and condominium conversions. Accordingly, section 26-511 (c) (9) (b), as applied to plaintiffs, rent-stabilized tenants occupying garden apartments converted into individual houses, is constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Swedish daily newspaper reported that Swiss authorities had frozen a private figure's account into which an arms company had deposited commissions. A New York operator of a news service transmitted the wire service story to India and printed and distributed the story in England and New York. The private figure was awarded damages and attorney's fees in his libel action against the operator. The private figure sought to enforce the judgment in New York by motion for summary judgment in lieu of a complaint. The court held that enforcement of the English judgment violated U.S. Const. amend. I. The court held that the English court unconstitutionally and with chilling effect placed the burden of proving truth upon the media defendants who published speech of public concern. The court found that the English courts did not require the private figure to prove falsity or that the operator was at fault in any degree in disseminating another news company's press report.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgments - Foreign Judgment - Enforcement of English Libel Judgment </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An English libel judgment obtained by plaintiff, an Indian national, based upon a wire service story transmitted by defendant regarding plaintiff's involvement in an international scandal which touched major players in Indian politics, is not entitled to enforcement in New York pursuant to CPLR 5304 on constitutional grounds because English libel law, contrary to constitutional requirements in this country, places the burden of proving truth upon media defendants which publish speech of public concern. Plaintiff's failure to prove falsity in the English libel action renders the judgment unenforceable in this State.  In addition, enforcement of the English judgment would also violate the First Amendment since plaintiff was not required to and did not meet the &quot;less forbidding&quot; constitutional requirement that a private figure show that a media defendant, which published a matter arguably within the sphere of legitimate public concern, acted in a grossly irresponsible manner without due consideration for the standards of information gathering and dissemination ordinarily followed by responsible parties. </SPAN></P>

Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. In granting plaintiff's motion and denying defendant's, the court found that the physicians had a constitutionally protected property interest in their registrations. The court determined that defendant's elimination of the third year of registration effectively rendered the licensed physicians unable to practice without paying and registering again, which was a taking without just compensation. The court declared 1990 N.Y. Laws ch. 190, &sect; 280 void and unconstitutional to the extent it affected a taking of the physicians' property without compensation and concluded that it changed the physicians' terms of registration by reducing the state's obligation by a year, which substantially impaired the purpose of registration certificates. The court stated the process would be meaningless if the state could invalidate registration certificates at will.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Laws of 1990 (ch 190, &sect; 280), which changed the registration fee periods for licensed physicians from a triennial to a biennial basis, is unconstitutional and void as retroactively applied to the 1989 triennial registration ending on December 31, 1991 since the State's elimination of the third prepaid year in 1991, thereby rendering licensed physicians unable to practice in 1991 unless they paid and registered again for that year, constituted a taking of property without due process and just compensation. Where the Department of Education issues registration certificates for a fee which are supposed to be valid until the end of a set registration period (Education Law &sect;&sect; 6524, 6502 [1]), the State creates a constitutionally protected interest in the term of the registration. A physician has a legitimate claim of entitlement in the validity of the registration until the stated expiration.  Physicians had a right to practice according to their registrations in 1991, and this right cannot be arbitrarily taken away, regardless of whether physicians could ransom their right to practice by paying additional registration fees.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Contract Clause - Retroactive Change in Registration Period for Licensed Physicians </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Laws of 1990 (ch 190, &sect; 280), which changed the registration fee periods for licensed physicians from a triennial to a biennial basis, is unconstitutional under the Contract Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 10, cl [1]) as retroactively applied to the 1989 triennial registration ending on December 31, 1989 since the reduction of the 1989 registration period by one year, thereby rendering licensed physicians unable to practice in 1991 unless they paid and registered again for that year, substantially impaired the rights of valid registration holders granted by the registration contract with the State.  The statutory registration process (Education Law &sect;&sect; 6524, 6502 [1]) gives rise to a contractual relation between the State and licensed physicians.  In this case, the measures taken by the State are not so reasonable and so appropriate to advance the State's legitimate interest in investigating and policing medical misconduct as to warrant the impairment of the State's contractual obligation to physicians.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Right to Jury Trial - Multiple Petty Offenses Punishable by Aggregate Sentence Exceeding Six Months - Violations of Administrative Code of City of New York </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Where defendant is charged with multiple offenses under the Administrative Code of the City of New York, each carrying a penalty of less than six months' incarceration but in the aggregate punishable by a potential penalty in excess of six months, the defendant's trial must be a nonjury trial, and the maximum aggregate sentence shall not exceed six months.  CPL 340.40, which requires, in New York City, a single-Judge nonjury trial where an information charges a misdemeanor for which the authorized term of imprisonment is not more than six months, must be interpreted to require a single-Judge trial for multiple offenses each of which carries a penalty of not more than six months' incarceration. Moreover, in multiple petty count cases, the right to a jury trial requires a trial by jury only where a sentence of more than six months is imposed; it is the exercise of the court's discretion to impose sentences in the aggregate exceeding six months, and not the fact that such discretion exists, which triggers a right to a jury trial. Accordingly, since imposition of a sentence in the aggregate exceeding six months would trigger the right to a jury trial, but CPL 340.40 requires a nonjury trial for multiple petty offenses, defendant here must receive a nonjury trial and the maximum aggregate sentence imposed cannot exceed six months.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Right to Jury Trial - What Constitutes &quot;Serious&quot; Offense </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant, who is charged with multiple offenses under the Administrative Code of the City of New York, is not entitled to a jury trial on the ground that his exposure to a potential fine of $ 5,000 together with a six-month potential prison sentence renders the offenses charged &quot;serious&quot; for purposes of attachment of the constitutional right to trial by jury. Where the maximum authorized prison term does not exceed six months, a presumption exists that the Legislature viewed the offense as petty. Where the additional penalty is a fine, so long as it is below the $ 5,000 level, the statutory penalties are not so severe as to deem the offense &quot;serious&quot; for Sixth Amendment purposes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Selective Prosecution </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendants charged with four counts of violations of the Administrative Code of the City of New York have failed to establish that they are being selectively prosecuted since they have not demonstrated a reasonable probability of success in proving that the law was not applied to others similarly situated and that selective application of the law was deliberately based upon an impermissible standard such as race, religion or some other arbitrary classification.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff cigarette machine vendors' declaratory judgment action to invalidate New York City, N.Y. Admin. Code &sect; 17-177, which restricted the distribution of certain tobacco products through the location of cigarette vending machines, on that ground that it failed to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cigarette machine vendors contended that &sect; 17-177 seriously interfered with their business activities because it limited the sale of cigarettes from vending machines to taverns. In support of their claim that &sect; 17-177 was unconstitutional, the vendors claimed that it was preempted by state law and was void for vagueness. The city, on the other hand, contended that &sect; 17-177 was a valid exercise of police power to protect the health of children and adolescents. The court granted the city's motion to dismiss the vendor's action. The court disagreed with the vendors' claim that, by the enactment of four state statutes, the state enacted a comprehensive scheme to regulate tobacco products. In so ruling, the court stated that the mere fact that &sect; 17-177 concerned the same area of regulation as the state statutes did not render the city ordinance invalid. Further, court stated that any argument that &sect; 17-177 was preempted by state law because it prohibited what state law permitted was without merit. The court also held that &sect; 17-177 was not void for vagueness. Indeed, the definition of &quot;tavern&quot; was clear and unambiguous.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Regulation of Cigarette Vending Machines </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A local law of the City of New York which prohibits the sale and distribution of tobacco products through vending machines except in a tavern (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 17-177) is a valid exercise of the police power designed to protect the City's minor citizens from the documented health hazards of smoking. The mere existence of State statutes relating to cigarette sales and smoking (Tax Law &sect; 480-a; General Business Law &sect; 399-e; Penal Law &sect; 260.20; Public Health Law &sect; 1399-n </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not render the local law invalid under the preemption doctrine as being inconsistent with a comprehensive State scheme of regulation since the local law is separate and dramatically different from the purposes of the State statutes.  Nor does the local law either prohibit conduct which the State law expressly or impliedly permits or impose additional restrictions on rights granted by State law.  Furthermore, the portions of the ordinance which are applicable solely to taverns does not preempt the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law since the local law does not in any way regulate the sale, distribution or consumption of alcoholic beverages. Moreover, the local law is precise and detailed and is thus not void for vagueness. Lastly, plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the law on the grounds that its enforcement will result in decreased fees and State tax revenue from cigarette vending machines. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant, charged with committing disorderly conduct, moved to dismiss charges on the grounds that disorderly conduct statute,&nbsp;N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a complaint charging criminal defendant with disorderly conduct, a violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.20. Plaintiff alleged that defendant had yelled a profanity outside a public place and then kicked a police car. Defendant, prior to trial, filed a motion to dismiss the charges on the grounds that &sect; 240.20 was unconstitutional as applied, it being violative of N.Y. Const. art. I &sect; 8 and U.S. Const. amend. I. Defendant cited in support the state's highest court's ruling that the similarly worded harassment statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.25, was unconstitutional. Trial court denied defendant's motion, noting that protected speech may still be regulated in terms of time, place, and manner, and that in defendant's case it was alleged that he had yelled while in a public place and kicked a police car. Under those circumstances, he could be tried for his conduct.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Penal Law &sect; 240.20 (3), which provides that a person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoy- ance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, in a public place he uses abusive or obscene language, or makes an obscene gesture, is not unconstitutional on its face.  Implicit in the statute is a limiting or saving construction that a breach of the peace must be intended to occur or likely to occur as a result of the actions of the defendant, which comports with constitutional guidelines and logically applies only to fighting words or words that would evoke a breach of the peace; thus, the statute passes constitutional muster.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, livery owners coalition and independent livery owners, filed a motion for an order enjoining defendants, state insurance fund (fund) and workers compensation board (board), from enforcing Laws of 1986, ch. 903, 1986 N.Y. Laws (statute), and declaring it unconstitutional. The fund and the board sought an order dismissing the complaint and declaring the statute constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fund and the board interpreted the ch. 903 as defining an employer-employee relationship between the livery car base owners and the livery car owner operators for the purposes of workers' compensation coverage. The livery owners coalition and the individual livery owners claimed that the statute, which provided that the livery car base owners had to pay workers' compensation premiums on behalf of the independent owner-operators, was unconstitutional. The coalition and owners sought injunctive relief. The fund and the board sought an order dismissing their complaint and declaring the statute constitutional. The court denied the coalition and owners injunctive relief, dismissed their complaint, and declared the statute constitutional on its face. The court found that the fund and board's interpretation of the statute furthered the goal of expanding workers' compensation coverage and made the assessment and collection of premiums more efficient. According to the court, the statute and the fund and board's interpretation of the statute had a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his conviction, defendant filed a motion with the court seeking to have his conviction vacated on the ground that the prosecution deprived him of discoverable impeachment material that could have been used during his criminal trial. The court granted the motion to vacate the conviction and ordered a new trial. The court found that defendant was not required under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10 (1)(f) to demonstrate an actual prejudice occurred by soliciting testimony from jurors because prejudice could be readily ascertained by the court. The court held that the proper standard of review was whether there was a reasonable possibility that such a failure to disclose the material contributed to the verdict. The court concluded that there was little doubt as to whether the undisclosed material in question contributed to defendant's conviction where the undisclosed material could have been used by defendant to impeach a witness who testified that defendant had admitted that he had committed the crime. The court also noted the undisclosed material could have been used by defendant to impeach witnesses who identified defendant as the perpetrator of the crime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rule of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Jackson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (78 NY2d 638), which, in a postconviction CPL article 440 motion based upon the deprivation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Rosario</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> material at trial, requires &quot;harmless error&quot; analysis to determine whether there is a &quot;reasonable possibility&quot; that the failure to disclose the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Rosario</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> material contributed to the guilty verdict, does not require the application of a subjective test for actual prejudice, whereby former jurors would be asked what they would have done had they known of the undisclosed evidence.  The nature of the evidence from an &quot;inquiry&quot; of the actual jurors would be patently unseemly, unreliable, often unavailable, and would be inconsistent with the strong public policy favoring the confidentiality and sanctity of jury deliberations in criminal matters. Rather, the court must make a detached and reasoned assessment of the cumulative effect of any </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Rosario</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violations on the verdict based on the reasonable reaction to the absent evidence from the viewpoint of the hypothetical fair-minded &quot;deliberative&quot; juror. Accordingly, in this case, the undisclosed evidence that the witness who testified as to an incriminating statement made by defendant had said nothing of defendant's admission during prior police/prosecutor interviews, combined with the undisclosed evidence of the identifying witness's prior inconsistent description, so severely prejudiced defendant as to require a new trial ( CPL 440.10 [4]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Roman Catholic adoptive parents were in the process of adopting a handicapped child when defendant adoption agency terminated the adoption in accordance with the religious matching provisions of the adoption law because the birth mother preferred that the child be placed in a Jewish home. When their request for a hearing was denied by defendant New York State Department of Social Services, plaintiffs filed an action alleging violation of their constitutional rights. Defendants filed motions to dismiss. The court held that although plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the action as taxpayers under the Finance Law, they did have standing predicated on the breach of constitutional rights because they were directly injured by defendants' application of the religious matching provisions. The court denied defendants' motion as to the claim that defendants used the religious preference provision as the sole factor in deciding placement of the child, because if the averments were true, that was a cognizable claim. The court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the claim that the religious preference provision violated plaintiffs' right to freely exercise their religion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs, who were allegedly disqualified as adoptive parents of a physically disabled child solely because of the biological parents' stated religious preference for placement, lack standing as taxpayers, pursuant to State Finance Law &sect; 123-b, to enjoin defendants' administration of the religious matching provisions of the adoption laws (Family Ct Act &sect; 116 [e]) as an unconstitutional disbursement of State funds since, even if New York has an improper institutional policy to place children &quot;solely or predominantly&quot; on the basis of religion, moneys expended on housing and clothing foster children cannot be characterized as a wrongful expenditure or misapplication of State funds, especially in light of the discretion granted to officials to make placement determinations based on the best interest of the child.  However, plaintiffs do have standing to challenge defendants' religious placement policy based on the claim that their constitutional rights have been violated by defendants' application of the statutory religious matching provisions.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiffs, who were allegedly disqualified as adoptive parents of a physically disabled child solely because of the biological parents' stated religious preference for placement, state a cause of action for declaratory and injunctive relief in regard to defendants' administration of the religious matching provisions of the adoption laws (Family Ct Act &sect; 116 [e]) since, if plaintiffs' central claim is proven, religion would be the controlling factor in determining whether a placement is in the best interest of a child in violation of the Establishment Clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions.  However, even if religion is the sole or predominant factor upon which placement decisions are made, plaintiffs fail to state a cause of action based on interference with their fundamental constitutional right of free exercise of religion since plaintiffs are free to adopt a child whose natural parents were &quot;indifferent&quot; to the religious placement of their child and, thus, it cannot be said that there is substantial pressure on plaintiffs to modify their religious beliefs. Similarly, since the religious matching provisions have a valid legitimate secular purpose sufficient to withstand rational basis scrutiny, plaintiffs' equal protection claims must be dismissed.  Furthermore, plaintiffs' substantive and procedural due process claims must likewise be dismissed since plaintiffs failed to show a protected interest within the Due Process Clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions.  </SPAN></P>

In addition, the regulation which permits only foster parents and certain blood relatives who are unsuccessful in adopting a child to contest the determination at a hearing (18 NYCRR 421.18 [n] [1]) is not inconsistent with State law.  There is no statutory requirement that plaintiffs be provided with a hearing.  </SPAN></P>

Furthermore, plaintiffs do not state a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress since defendants did not owe plaintiffs a duty, arising from special circumstances, as would permit recovery for pure emotional harm, nor was there any allegation of &quot;contemporaneous or consequential physical harm&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest resulting from an incident where he made a crude outburst directed at police officers.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Disorderly Conduct </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, who is charged with disorderly conduct for repeatedly clutching his genitals and yelling offensive epithets at a police officer while a crowd gathered and joined defendant's chants, has failed to meet his burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute (Penal Law &sect; 240.20 [1]), which proscribes engaging &quot;in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior&quot; with &quot;intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof&quot;, on its face, impinges upon constitutionally protected speech. The statute punishes conduct and there is thus no reasonable possibility that the statute presents a significant risk of prosecution for the mere exercise of free speech.  However, since defendant's threatening comments and gestures in the absence of &quot;violent&quot; or &quot;tumultuous&quot; behavior did not present a clear and present danger of inciting those listening to lawless action, or constitute &quot;fighting words&quot; likely to provoke a retaliatory response from the police officer, and amounted to pure, constitutionally protected speech, defendant's prosecution in this case impermissibly infringes upon his State constitutional rights of free expression. Furthermore, since the officer lacked authority to arrest defendant for disorderly conduct at the time defendant struggled with the officer, an essential element of resisting arrest is lacking (Penal Law &sect; 205.30) and that charge must thus be dismissed for facial insufficiency.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A village ordinance requiring a property owner to maintain the premises &quot;in good repair&quot; and keep structures painted or covered in a protective coating in order to &quot;foster the health, safety and welfare&quot; and &quot;maintain the neighborhood and property values&quot; is based on valid governmental objectives and is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.  The statutory term &quot;in good repair&quot; is not incapable of definition and is not a phrase which the common sense of a reasonable person would not comprehend.  Furthermore, a person of ordinary intelligence would be capable of recognizing if a structure needed painting or a protective coating. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Information - Violations of Village Ordinance - Dismissal in Interests of Justice </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Informations charging defendant with violating a village ordinance requiring a property owner to maintain the premises &quot;in good repair&quot; and keep the property free of litter and debris fairly apprise defendant of the charges against him and contain sufficient nonhearsay allegations to establish every element of the violations charged ( CPL 100.15, 100.40).  The allegations are based upon an inspector's personal observations and even detail the types of debris and garbage found on defendant's property. Furthermore, the failure to allege intent does not warrant dismissal since building and zoning code violations are based upon strict liability and, thus, intent is not an element of the violations charged.  In addition, defendant is not entitled to a dismissal in the interests of justice ( CPL 170.30 [1] [g]) on the ground that the village's delays in granting renovation permits caused the charged violations since the normal expense to defendant of painting his building, boarding up the windows and keeping the property free from litter results in little financial burden and defendant could thus have maintained the premises regardless of the eventual granting or denial of future building permits.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A village comprised of Hasidic Jews practiced separation from the outside community and separation of the sexes. Yiddish was the principle language of the village; television, radio, and English publications were not in general use. The dress and appearance of the village residents were also distinctive. In an attempt to compromise an ongoing dispute regarding whether special services to the village's handicapped children were required to have been provided in the public schools or religiously affiliated private schools, Laws of 1989, ch. 748 was enacted, which created a separate school district for the village. Plaintiffs brought an action challenging the statute's constitutionality. The court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, finding that Laws of 1989, ch. 748 violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and its state counterpart, N.Y. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3. The court found that the statute had a sectarian purpose rather than a secular purpose, its purpose was to meet exclusive religious need, it was impermissibly entangled with religion, and it gave the appearance of symbolic benefit to religion.</SPAN></P>

A law creating a village school district for a village of Hasidic Jews in an effort to provide public funding for special educational services for the village's nonpublic school handicapped children (L 1989, ch 748) is unconstitutional as violative of the Establishment of Religion Clause of the State and Federal Constitutions (NY Const, art XI, &sect; 3; US Const 1st Amend). The school district was created solely and exclusively to meet religious needs, the village residents having rejected any attempts to provide for the education of nonpublic school handicapped pupils at a neutral site, and has the effect of advancing, protecting and fostering the religious beliefs of the inhabitants of the school district. The law also fosters excessive entanglements with religion in view of the special steps the State Education Department must take to monitor the newly created school district to ensure that public funds are not expended to further religious purposes.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 2201, petitioner car owner moved for an order from the court to stay the sale of an automobile and, by a special proceeding simultaneously commenced, also moved to cancel respondent garage owner's lien on the automobile.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The car owner moved for an order staying the sale of his car and simultaneously sought to cancel the garage owner's lien. The car owner claimed that the garage owner agreed to store his vehicle without charge and then performed various repairs without consent. The car owner asserted that he was served him with a notice of foreclosure sale without a demand for payment or any other notice. The garage owner denied the allegations, including ownership, and asserted that he surrendered the vehicle to a third party who had allegedly exhibited a certificate of title. The court found that while City Civ. Ct. Act 209 (a) statutorily granted the court subject matter jurisdiction over proceedings under to N.Y. Lien Law &sect; 207 the court was granted no injunctive jurisdiction in connection with such proceeding. The court held that the jurisdictional provision of N.Y. Lien Law &sect; 201-a, which permitted proceeding to be brought in any court having monetary jurisdiction, could not grant injunctive jurisdiction to a court that did not have it. The court, however, stayed further proceedings to permit the car owner to apply to the proper forum for both removal and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While finding that it lacked the subject matter jurisdiction to enjoin a lien sale, the court held that if it denied the motion for a stay and proceeded to adjudicate the underlying special proceeding the car might well be sold before the rights of the parties were determined. The court therefore stayed all further proceedings in order to permit car owner to apply to the proper forum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - New York City Civil Court - No Subject Matter Jurisdiction to Enjoin Lien Sale </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York City Civil Court, which possesses no equitable power other than that specifically bestowed by Constitution or statute, lacks subject matter jurisdiction to order injunctive relief staying a lien sale within a special proceeding challenging the validity of the lien over which it has subject matter jurisdiction (CCA 202).  CPLR 2201, which codifies a court's inherent power to stay its own proceedings in a pending case, is inapplicable since a lien sale is not a function of the court's own process and, thus, at the time the injunctive relief was requested, there was no action pending in which the court's proceedings could have been stayed.  CPLR 2201 is not a substitute for, nor an alternative to, a proper application for injunctive relief under CPLR article 63.  In addition, Lien Law &sect; 201-a, which sets forth the power of the court and the procedure to be followed in a special proceeding to determine a lien's validity, grants no injunctive jurisdiction to a court not already vested with it.  Accordingly, in order to prevent any injustice, all further proceedings will be stayed pursuant to CPLR 326 (a) and 2201 in order to permit petitioner to make proper application in the Supreme Court for both removal of the proceedings under CPLR 325 and appropriate injunctive relief. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner lake club commenced a hybrid proceeding that challenged a unit management plan (UMP) for a forest area adopted by respondents, Department of Environmental Conservation and others. Petitioner sought a prohibition of UMP's application, a declaratory judgment that the UMP violated N.Y. Const. art. XIV and violated certain easements, and violations of the provisions of the State Environmental Quality Review Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents adopted a UMP for a forest area. Respondents intended to construct a number of small parking areas, which provided access to trails and primitive campsites, to relocate certain trails to avoid private lands, and to construct new trails. Petitioner argued that the UMP violated the New York Constitution because it required the cutting of a number of trees. The court found that the great majority of the cutting would be completely decomposed within a few years leaving no trace of their existence but providing increased growth opportunity for the remaining trees in the forest. Thus it was not constitutional prohibited. The court found that respondents' negative declaration did not consider the increased usage of the recreational facility and failed to consider the aesthetics of new trails in currently totally wild areas or the camping impact. The court granted the portion of the petition that challenged the UMP on the ground that respondents failed to comply with the provisions of the State Environmental Quality Review Act because the UMP may have had an adverse impact on the environment, which required an environmental impact statement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - State Forest Preserve - Lawful Cutting of Trees to Facilitate Use of Forest Preserve </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The cutting of as many as 2,000 &quot;trees&quot;, most of which are less than three inches diameter, in a State-owned forest preserve as part of respondents' plan to construct a number of small parking areas providing access to trails and primitive campsites, to relocate certain trails to avoid private lands and to construct new trails, does not violate the constitutional prohibition against the removal or destruction of &quot;timber&quot; within State-owned forest lands (NY Const, art XIV, &sect; 1).  Insubstantial and immaterial cutting of trees is constitutionally authorized in order to facilitate public use of the forest preserve where such use is consistent with wild forest lands.  Here, the amount of vegetation, seedlings, saplings and timber-sized trees destroyed in the construction of the relocated trails, is not constitutionally prohibited nor is the number of trees planned to be removed to complete such relocation.  Furthermore, the construction of new trails, thereby increasing human activity, does not violate the further constitutional requirement that the forest preserve lands &quot;be forever kept as wild forest lands&quot; since such requirement is intended not to prevent or hinder public use of the forest, but to allow forest areas to revert to their natural or wild state without human interference.  There is no indication of any intent to maintain the forest in an &quot;absolutely&quot; wild state with no organized human alteration or intervention at all.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Environmental Quality Review - Plan to Relocate and Construct Trails in State Forest Preserve </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondents violated the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL art 8) by failing to take the requisite &quot;hard look&quot; at any relevant area of environmental concern before adopting a plan to construct small parking areas providing access to trails and primitive campsites, to relocate certain trails to avoid private lands and to construct new trails all within a State- owned forest preserve. The negative declaration issued by respondents fails to contain a reasoned elaboration of the basis for the determination supported by empirical and scientific authority.  It is clear that respondents' plan may have an adverse impact on the environment requiring preparation of an environmental impact statement in view of the almost certain substantial increase in the legal use of the forest preserve resulting from implementation of respondents' plan.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Easements - Scope of Easement - Designation of Cross-Country Ski Trail in State Forest Preserve </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Respondents' designation of a cross-country ski trail as part of a plan to relocate and construct new trails within a State-owned forest preserve does not violate the terms of an easement granted by petitioner's predecessors in title to respondents' predecessors in title allowing logging and hunting, since the uses allowed by the easement have the potential for substantially greater impact upon petitioner's lands than cross-country skiing.  Moreover, the easement refers to the existence of certain public trails, which have been in public use for decades, and implicitly allows the continuation of such public trails. Accordingly, respondents' plan does not violate any of petitioner's property rights in and to the proposed cross-country ski trail. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The villages were in the town. With authority granted by the state specifically to the town by 1983 N.Y. Laws ch. 544, the town adopted a law for the disposal of solid waste. Town's waste management authority bought land for a landfill. Under N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 27-0704, landfills were to close by a certain date. The town therefore chose alternate locations for waste. Aware of the deadline, the first and second villages made an agreement with a facility for waste disposal. The town filed an action against the first and second villages seeking a permanent injunction, and the third village filed an action against the town seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The parties filed motions and cross-motions for summary judgment. The court denied the town's motion and the third village's cross-motion, granted the second villages cross motion, and dismissed the town's complaint. Under N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(d), and N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 10(5), the town lacked the power to adopt its law because N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 11(3) stipulated that town laws did not apply to villages. 1983 N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action brought by the Town of North Hempstead (Town) against defendant incorporated villages to enforce the Town's Flow Control Law, which requires that all solid waste generated in the Town, including the incorporated villages, be delivered to a solid waste management facility designated by the Town, it is not necessary that other villages within the Town be joined as parties pursuant to CPLR 1001 (a).  Three villages directly affected by the outcome of this litigation have been actively participating in these lawsuits. The likelihood that the remaining villages are united in interest is great.  Under such circumstances, dismissal or joinder is not necessary.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Home Rule Powers - Solid Waste Management </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. State enabling legislation, passed without a home rule message or certificate of necessity, which authorizes plaintiff Town of North Hempstead (Town) to adopt a local law to, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;exclusively control all solid waste ... including without limitation the collection, transportation and delivery of solid waste to a designated resource recovery facility or facilities within the town&quot; and to collect fees for said services (L 1983, ch 544), unconstitutionally infringes on the constituent villages' home rule powers (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [b]) and is invalid. In the absence of a home rule message, the State must demonstrate a State concern when enacting special laws in areas relating to a local government's property, affairs or government.  In this case, although the enabling legislation contains a pro forma recitation of its purported State concern, i.e., the protection of the environment by controlling air, water and land pollution, and to promote solid waste management, the true purpose of the law is to provide the Town with a funding mechanism to finance a resource recovery facility, a matter that is not a State concern.  Furthermore, the Town's Flow Control Law, passed pursuant to the enabling legislation and the powers subsequently vested in the Town of North Hempstead Solid Waste Management Authority (Public Authorities Law &sect; 2049-a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">),</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is likewise unconstitutional for impairing the incorporated villages' home rule powers to control their waste disposal (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [d]; Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 [5]; &sect; 11 [3]).  </SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs claimed that the state's financial scheme for education based on property tax valuation failed to satisfy the education article, N. Y. Const. art XI, &sect; 1, and violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and of N.Y. Const. art I, &sect; 11. Plaintiffs claimed that huge disparities existed as a result of the inadequacy and unfairness of the formulas by which state aid was distributed among the state's 700 school districts. The state maintained that this showing was insufficient absent a showing of &quot;gross and glaring inadequacy&quot; in the quality of education provided. The court held that plaintiffs had vividly demonstrated the disparities in expenditures per pupil between property-wealthy and poor districts, but that the primary responsibility for the provision of fair and equitable educational opportunity rested with the Legislature. The court dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the motion to dismiss, concluding that any proscription of pure speech had to be sharply limited to words which, by their utterance alone, inflicted injury or tended naturally to evoke immediate violence or other breach of the peace and holding that &sect; 240.20(3) was unconstitutionally overbroad and invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner filed an action for a declaratory judgment that defendant town's Local Law No. 2 of 1990, which imposed a &quot;temporary&quot; restriction upon the construction of docks in town waterways until 60 days after the date of the adoption of a local waterfront revitalization plan, or May 20, 1991, whichever was earlier, was void. Relief was also sought to enjoin the town from prohibiting the landowner from erecting a dock on his property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner wanted to build a timber dock on his property. The Department of Environmental Conservation issued him a permit. Thereafter, the town imposed its first temporary restriction on construction of docks in town waterways for the purpose of developing a waterfront revitalization plan. The temporary restriction was extended numerous times. The landowner sought a declaration that the local laws enacting the moratorium were void, and were of no effect as to his property; he also sought an injunction enjoining the town from prohibiting his building of the dock or requiring him to secure a town permit. The landowner argued that the inordinate delay in the town's final development of its revitalization plan resulted in a violation of his constitutional rights. The court granted the landowner's motion for summary judgment. The court noted that the town had developed an embryonic plan for protecting its harbors in 1984, but had not come up with a definite plan. The court held that the town's legislative limitation on the landowner's right to use his property, halted for a period extending over three years by virtue of the moratoriums, was excessive and unconstitutionally void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the landowner's motion for summary judgment striking the town's answer on the ground that there was no defense to the cause of action alleged in the complaint. The court held that the town's law was void and of no effect as to the landowner's property. The court enjoined the town from prohibiting the landowner from erecting a dock on his property. Finally, the town was ordered to issue the landowner a construction permit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A local law of defendant town enacting a further moratorium on the construction of docks in town waterways until 60 days after the adoption of a local waterfront revitalization plan or February 21, 1992 is void and of no effect as to plaintiff's property due to defendant's unreasonable delay in enacting a definite plan for protecting its harbors. Such a plan was first proposed in 1984, but defendant has yet to enact a definite plan, and there is no expectation of one in the future.  Moreover, no dire necessity, crisis condition or emergency situation has been demonstrated by defendant to justify the stop-gap legislation.  Accordingly, defendant's legislative limitation on plaintiff's right to use his property, now halted for a period extending over three years by virtue of continued moratoriums, is excessive and constitutionally void. Defendant is enjoined from prohibiting plaintiff from erecting a dock on or adjacent to his property as permitted by the Department of Environmental Conservation and defendant shall issue a permit to plaintiff for the construction of the proposed dock. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer negotiated to purchase a housing building for the purpose of demolishing it and erecting an office building. At the time of the negotiations, local laws placed an 18-month moratorium on the demolition of multiple dwelling units, and required a nonharassment certificate prior to the demolition. The local laws contained an exclusion for buildings whose occupancy was restricted to &quot;institutional use.&quot; The developer obtained an institutional use exemption after signing a promissory note to place money in the city's trust for low-income housing, to expedite the process. When the city attempted to collect on the note, the developer refused, asserting duress and that the contract was void because the local laws were determined to be unconstitutional. The city filed an action to enforce and the court granted summary judgment in favor of the city. The developer failed to prove duress. The fact that the local laws were subsequently deemed unconstitutional did not relieve the developer's duties under the contract because it was aware of the laws when it signed the note. The contract was mutually beneficial and entered into in good faith by the city, creating a binding contract.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An agreement executed in 1985 whereby defendant, a real estate developer, in connection with its plan to construct an office tower on the site of an existing building owned by a charitable trust for low- and moderate-income housing, agreed to pay $ 500,000 to the trust for such housing if it received a prompt determination from plaintiff City of New York that the building was exempt from the moratorium on the demolition of single room occupancy (SRO) buildings then in effect and was &quot;timely&quot; issued the necessary permits to begin lawful construction, is valid and enforceable even though the permit approval process was unnecessarily protracted, causing delays, increased costs and lost revenues.  Since the sole reason for the agreement was the need for a prompt and favorable determination of the building's SRO status, the &quot;timely&quot; issuance of the permits must be interpreted to mean &quot;without delay attributable to the existing building's possible SRO status&quot;, and not merely &quot;without unnecessary delay&quot;; thus, the City's grant of an &quot;institutional use&quot; exemption to the building on the same day the agreement was executed and the building sold to defendant constitutes valid consideration for the agreement.  The agreement is not voidable on the ground of duress since defendant must accept the consequences of having moved headlong into a major real estate development project without checking all of the legal implications, nor should it be voided by the subsequent determination by the Court of Appeals that the City's SRO law was unconstitutional.  Moreover, requiring a sophisticated business enterprise to honor a financial obligation made to the City in return for help in clearing reasonable hurdles applicable to the project does not violate public policy. </SPAN></P>

The supreme court held, however, that the stop and search were proper because the officer possessed an articulable objective reason for approaching defendant and requesting information. According to the supreme court, it was immaterial that the officer predicated his approach upon his assumption that he was investigating a violation of a probably unconstitutional loitering statute.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cocaine seized from defendant's pocket after a consensual pat-down search and defendant's written statement admitting possession of cocaine should not be suppressed where the arresting officer, responding to a report that several individuals were shooting dice in public at a designated address, initially approached defendant and the group he was with on the basis of the probably unconstitutional loitering for the purpose of gambling statute (Penal Law &sect; 240.35 [2]), since a police approach for the purpose of requesting information premised on a probably unconstitutional statute can still be equated with a lawful approach premised on the requisite objective credible reason.  In this case, the police officer was not precluded from responding to a radio dispatch that individuals were loitering and playing dice to investigate whether the crimes of promoting gambling (Penal Law &sect; 225.05) or possession of a gambling device (Penal Law &sect; 225.30 [2]) were being committed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions from the lower court (New York) for public exposure under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 245.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' convictions for public exposure was reversed and the indictments dismissed pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 470.20 (2), (5). The appellate court found that the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's convictions. Defendants, females, were charged under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 245.01 for sunbathing topless. The appellate court found the statute unconstitutional as violating the equal protection clause because the gender-based classification did not serve a legitimate governmental interest better than a gender-neutral law would. According to the court, the test for determining constitutionality turned on whether the statute protected a legitimate government interest and whether the classification was a reasonable means of achieving substantial government ends and not merely the arbitrary classifying of people by sexual stereotype. The appellate court held that there was no physiologically difference between male and female breast except for lactation capability. Although the court found the statute unconstitutional, the court reversed the convictions based on insufficiency of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' convictions were reversed because the evidence was insufficient to support their conviction where the evidence showed that a change in community standard negated the notion that a woman's breast was a private or intimate part of a person's body.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Exposure of Person - Unconstitutional Gender-Based Classification </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exposure of a person statute (Penal Law &sect; 245.01) is unconstitutional as violative of equal protection to the extent that it prohibits only a female from appearing at a public place with her breasts unclothed since the statute's gender-based classification does not serve the legitimate governmental interest in protecting the public's sensibilities better than would a gender-neutral law.  The unconstitutionality of that part of the statute does not require reversal of defendants' convictions, however, since the statute can be construed as gender neutral.  Nevertheless, in view of the testimony of defendants' expert witnesses that the change in community standards is such as to negate the notion that a woman's breast is a &quot;private or intimate part&quot; of a person's body, defendants' convictions are reversed as being legally insufficient and against the weight of the evidence (CPL 470.20 [2], [5]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed an application for a stay of judgment pending his appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted upon his guilty plea. Defendant filed an application for a stay of judgment with a court of concurrent jurisdiction. State alleged that the more appropriate forum for the application was the judge who took defendant's plea. The court held that was required to entertain the application because N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 460.50 gave defendant the right to make the stay application to any judge in the appropriate judicial district. Further, the court would deny defendant's due process rights by failing to hear the application. Although the court determined that there was an arguable issue of merit to be reviewed upon appeal, the court did not rule upon the application. The information supplied in support of and in opposition to the application was insufficient for the court to make an assessment of the degree of control necessary to secure defendant's court attendance during the appeal, pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 510.30(2)(a) and (b). The court instructed the parties to supply this evidence to the court.</SPAN></P>

The statute clearly authorizes the defendant to choose among a broad number of trial and appellate Judges to hear the single stay application allowed and that decision by the defendant is not one that can be usurped by a Judge through the mechanism of transferring the application to the Judge who presided over the case. Defendant would be denied due process if the Judge chosen declined to hear the stay application.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brought a motion to dismiss count three of the misdemeanor complaint filed by the people, which alleged the offense of endangering the welfare of a child (count three). Defendant contended that this count was facially insufficient under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law 170.40 and, alternatively, that dismissal was in the interest of justice pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law 170.30(1)(a),(g), 170.35.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by the police while driving in a state of intoxication when his vehicle contained two children. The police administered a test indicating a .18 percent blood alcohol content. The complaint alleged two counts of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs in violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1192(2),(3). The court declined to grant defendant's motion to dismiss count three. The court held that the facts alleged in the complaint and in the supporting deposition provided prima facie evidence of each element of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 260.10(1) including the likelihood of injury to the children passengers. The court decided that &sect; 260.10(1) was constitutional and rejected defendant's cited authority. The court ruled that the risk of harm to the child covered under &sect; 260.10(1) should be direct and was not limited to sexual and moral offenses. The court concluded that harm to the passengers was likely when defendant was using the accelerator and brake with unsteady feet when driving across the bridge at night. The court held that defendant's alternative motion for dismissal in the interest of justice was conclusory and lacked factual support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss count three of the people's misdemeanor complaint as facially insufficient. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss count three in the interest of justice under the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Endangering Welfare of Child - Driving while Intoxicated with Child Passengers </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegation that defendant was driving his automobile in an intoxicated condition while &quot;two small children&quot; were passengers in the car is sufficient to sustain a charge of endangering the welfare of a child under Penal Law &sect; 260.10 (1), which proscribes &quot;knowingly act[ing] in a manner likely to be injurious to the physical, mental or moral welfare of a child less than&quot; 17 years old.  The language of the child endangerment statute is not unconstitutionally vague. Nor does a cognizable wrong under the statute require that the potential of harm to which the child is subjected be actually realized or that the potential injury be the product of conduct focused directly upon the child.  The potential impact of the injury anticipated by the statute need not be direct, rather it must only be &quot;likely&quot;.  Accordingly, the facts alleged in the misdemeanor complaint together with those in the supporting deposition establish, prima facie, each of the elements of the offense charged, including the likelihood of injury to the child passengers. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner administratrix sought to recover the sum of $ 280,000 plus interest that had initially belonged to the decedent and was deposited into accounts containing the names of the decedent and respondent relative. The relative had withdrawn the funds from the accounts prior to decedent's death and deposited the proceeds into accounts in his name.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administratrix contended that the relative was liable for the total amount of the withdrawals because the accounts were convenience accounts rather than joint accounts. Alternatively, she sought to recover one-half of the amount on the ground that the relative had forfeited any survivorship interest by withdrawing the entire balance without obtaining decedent's consent. The relative contended that the accounts were joint accounts and that the decedent expressly or impliedly approved of the withdrawals. He also argued that the exclusion of his testimony under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 4519, the Dead Man's Statute, constituted an unconstitutional taking of property. The court found that, under the facts, the result was the same whether the accounts created a survivorship interest or a tenancy in common because the relative destroyed his rights of survivorship by withdrawing more than his interest without consent and because a tenancy in common interest only entitled the relative to one-half of the sum. The court expressed its dissatisfaction with the provisions of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 4519, but stated that, in the absence of any constitutional infirmity, the statute had to be enforced as enacted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the administratrix was entitled to recover from the relative the sum of $ 134,117.00, which was the $ 140,000.00 improperly withdrawn from the accounts minus $ 5,883.00 reimbursement for funeral expenses, plus interest at the statutory rate from the date of decedent's death.</SPAN></P>

The court found that N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judges filed a motion for summary judgment on their claim against the comptroller and the state, alleging that the Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions required that they be paid the same salary as county court judges serving in 13 other counties in the state. The judges also sought adjustment of their salaries and the comptroller and the state filed cross-motions for summary judgment, seeking dismissal of the complaint. The court granted the judges' motion for summary judgment, holding that the comptroller and the state offered no proof that the differences among the various counties was sufficient to support different salaries under constitutionally mandated equal protection standards. The court held that in order to satisfy equal protection, the judges' salaries should have been at least as high as those of county court judges in Erie and Monroe Counties. The court also held that it could discern no separate geographic considerations which differentiated the Syracuse metropolitan area from that of Albany and, thus, the judges' salaries should be equalized to the level of the Albany county court judges in order to satisfy equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The action by plaintiffs, Onondaga County Court Judges, pursuant to 42 USC &sect; 1983 to have the salary disparities among County Court Judges based on geographic factors resulting from the unification of the court system in 1976 declared unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection need not be brought in the Court of Claims since the action is not primarily for monetary damages but is rather an action for declaratory and injunctive relief in which back pay is requested as an incident to the primary relief.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiffs, Onondaga County Court Judges who are being paid at the lowest rate for County Court Judges in the State, have prevailed on their salary disparity claim under 42 USC &sect; 1983 and must be paid at the level of Albany County Court Judges in order to satisfy equal protection in view of the similarities in caseloads, populations and cost of living in the two counties.  The Third and Fourth Departments may properly be treated as a unity of judicial interest for purposes of determining whether salary differentials based on geographic factors for Judges having the same responsibilities and powers violate the equal protection guarantees of the Federal and State Constitutions.  Accordingly, plaintiffs are entitled to back pay based on the salary of the Albany County Court Judges retroactive to October 1, 1978 or the first date of judicial service if that service began after October 1, 1978.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants had moved to dismiss the charges of unlawful assembly filed against each of them under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.10, stemming from incidents alleged to have occurred in a park. Defendants contended that the unlawful assembly statute was facially unconstitutional, as vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants moved to dismiss the unlawful assembly prosecution brought against them, contending that the statute impermissibly trammeled their free speech rights. The court denied the motion. In so ruling, it noted that it was indeed possible to construe the unlawful assembly in a fashion violative of free speech. However, the court adhered to the precept that statutes are to be interpreted as being constitutional if at all possible. In this case, the unlawful assembly could be so construed, provided that it be interpreted as implicitly including the requirement that, in order to be convicted under the statute, the defendants' actions must had constituted an incitement which was both directed towards and likely to produce imminent violent and tumultuous conduct. With that definition being applied, the statute survived constitutional scrutiny, and the prosecution could go forward. Accordingly, defendants' dismissal motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' motion to dismiss was denied. Although the statute could be construed as being unconstitutional, it was not if it was assumed that language setting forth the constitutional limitations on unlawful assembly statutes was in the statute.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Assembly -- Constitutionality of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unlawful assembly statute (Penal Law &sect; 240.10) is not facially unconstitutional as vague and overbroad if constitutional protections are read into the statute to require that, before an individual may be charged with unlawful assembly, such individual's actions must constitute an incitement which is both directed towards and likely to produce imminent violent and tumultuous conduct.  When the group activity out of which the alleged offense develops can be described as involving both legal and illegal purposes and conduct, and is within the shadow of the First Amendment, the factual issue as to the alleged criminal intent must be strictly judged.  Specially meticulous inquiry into the sufficiency of proof is justified and required because of the real possibility in considering group activity, characteristic of political or social movements, that the intent or acts of some participants will unfairly be imputed to all others.  In cases arising under the unlawful assembly statute, juries should be instructed regarding the mandated First Amendment tests as well as the standard of strict scrutiny to be applied in their evaluation of the facts.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant resisted the provisions of the N.Y. City Crim. Ct. Act &sect; 50, under which defendant's landlord, after the district attorney's office declined to prosecute, pursued private prosecution for the misdemeanors of assault in the third degree, criminal mischief in the fourth degree, menacing, and harassment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The crimes charged against defendant were all allegedly based on the same incident for which the landlord had been charged with felony assault, an altercation between the two at the landlord's house. The court found that the N.Y. City Crim. Ct. Act &sect; 50, constituted a violation of defendant's rights to due process and equal protection. The court held that under the circumstances, all aspects of the landlord's felony prosecution constituted Brady material to which defendant was entitled. However, the court pointed out that neither the court nor the landlord, as a private individual, was entitled to access to the district attorney's file and, unless the landlord advised the court or defense counsel, no one would know if she filed a complaint with the police regarding the incident, and failure to turn over such a report to defendant constituted a Rosario violation, which would necessitate automatic reversal of any conviction. The court found that the complaint was a tactic to delay prosecution and to pressure defendant into withdrawing her charges of assault against the landlord. The court found the statute unconstitutional and granted the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss. The presumption that the state criminal statute was constitutional was overcome.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">District and Prosecuting Attorneys - Private Prosecution - Denial of Equal Protection and Due Process </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;New York City Criminal Court Act &sect; 50, which allows a private citizen to commence a prosecution for a crime without involvement of the public prosecutor, is unconstitutional as violative of defendant's rights to equal protection and due process as applied to this assault case wherein complainant instituted this private prosecution pursuant to the statute after she had been arrested for assaulting defendant based on the same incident and after the District Attorney's office had declined to accept prosecution of defendant. At the time of defendant's arraignment, complainant had been indicted for assault and criminal possession of a weapon for allegedly assaulting defendant.  Prosecution by a disinterested prosecutor is a fundamental aspect of due process that defendant would be deprived of if this private prosecution is allowed to continue.  A prosecution for a crime by a private citizen pursuant to the statute, after the District Attorney has declined to prosecute, makes a mockery of the criminal justice system by attempting to utilize the court for private ends.  Accordingly, defendant's motion to dismiss is granted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In criminal prosecution of defendant for narcotics offenses, pursuant to joint state and federal investigations of defendant, defendant's counsel sought an order prohibiting prosecution from seeking forfeiture of defendant's assets, under 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 881, and requiring prosecution to proceed under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and indicted in state court for several narcotics related offenses. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 881, prosecution seized defendant's, as well as defendant's ex-wife's, bank accounts in Puerto Rico. An account within the state, in the name of defendant's ex-wife, was also seized. From the latter account, defendant's ex-wife had issued a check for defendant's attorney's fees, but the funds were seized before the check could be deposited. Defendant's attorney moved for an order prohibiting prosecution from seeking forfeiture of defendant's assets, under &sect; 881, and requiring prosecution to proceed under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 13-A. The court denied the motion, holding that because defendant's assets were outside state's control and constitutional protections, and because the sole asset within state was in defendant's ex-wife's name and defendant did not claim it, the state had no jurisdiction over the assets, thus prosecution could proceed under state or federal forfeiture laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order denied; because defendant's assets were outside the state's control and constitutional protections, and because the sole asset within the state was in defendant's ex-wife's name and defendant did not claim it, the state had no jurisdiction over the assets, thus prosecution could proceed under state or federal forfeiture laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Forfeitures and Penalties -- Forfeiture of Proceeds or Instrumentality of Crime -- Election to Pursue Federal Forfeiture -- Duty of Prosecutor to Set Aside In-State Federally Seized Assets for Attorney's Fees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A State prosecutor who has investigated a defendant under joint Federal and State auspices, resulting in a New York State indictment for a violation of New York's narcotics laws, may elect to pursue Federal in rem Forfeiture proceedings (21 USC &sect; 881), rather than State in personam forfeiture proceedings (CPLR art 13-A), in order to seize out-of-State assets or assets located within the State which do not fall within the purview of the State's forfeiture law, as long as the defendant's State constitutional right to counsel of choice is protected (NY Const, art I, &sect; 6). Where a defendant's forfeited property is located within New York State, and subject to seizure under the State's forfeiture law, the People have a duty under the State Constitution to ensure that a portion of such in-State, Federally forfeited assets is made available for payment of reasonable attorney's fees for defendant's counsel of choice or risk the imposition of sanctions including dismissal of the State prosecution. In addition, the People have an obligation to ensure that the State is reimbursed for administrative expenses from any Federally seized assets. Accordingly, since, in this case, the State could not seize defendant's bank accounts located in Puerto Rico or the New York bank account in the name of his ex-wife under the State's forfeiture law, the prosecutor cannot be required to set aside those Federally forfeited funds so that defendant can retain counsel of choice. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner carting companies (carters) brought a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding with a temporary restraining order (TRO), and sought a preliminary injunction to enjoin respondent, the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs (commissioner) from enforcing new lower maximum rates for the collection of commercial refuse, adopted under New York City, N.Y. Admin. Code &sect; 20-335(b), and from a judgment vacating the rates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The carters objected to the new rates for refuse removal, claiming that the rate-setting procedure had violated due process, that &sect; 20-335(b) was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the commissioner, and that the new rates were irrational. The court denied the carters' petition. First, the procedures in &sect; 20-335(b) satisfied the due process test because they adequately safeguarded the carters' interests and minimized the risk of erroneous deprivation, while serving the substantial government interest in regulating the waste removal process. In addition, the commissioner had properly followed the &sect; 20-335(b) procedures and the record showed that the carters had been given the opportunity to participate meaningfully in the rate-making process. Second, the court found that &sect; 20-335(b) was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the commissioner because the legislature was entitled to commit to an administrative board the power to determine rates, and the carters had not met their burden of proving &sect; 20-335(b)&nbsp;unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. Last, the court found that the commissioner's determination had a rational basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the carters' application for a preliminary injunction, dismissed the carters' petition to vacate the new refuse removal rates, and vacated the TRO, thus allowing the new rates to go into effect.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent New York City Commissioner of Consumer Affairs acted lawfully in adopting new lower maximum rates that refuse carters may charge for commercial refuse collection. Petitioners, private commercial carting companies, were given the opportunity to participate meaningfully in the rate-making process and were not denied due process by respondent's refusal to allow discovery and cross-examination. The statutory scheme does not require an adjudicatory hearing but only that the rates be fixed after &quot;public hearings&quot; at which &quot;interested persons&quot; have the right to appear and give evidence (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 20-335 [b]).  As such, the statutory procedures for fixing the maximum rates for the removal of commercial refuse satisfy due process standards.

The court stated that a plain reading of N.Y. Const. art.

The department contended that the hospital did not timely appeal the calculation of its 1985 capital cost reimbursement and did not follow the formal route for its 1985 appeal. The hospital's accountants sent a letter stating their intention to appeal. The court held that the fundamental issue was the constitutionality of the amendment to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 10, &sect; 86-1.23(b), which provided that board-designated funds and the accrual of liabilities to the funded depreciation accounts should not be recognized as funding of depreciation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During trial for violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 511(1)(a), which prohibited operation of a motor vehicle with a suspended license, the defendant objected to admission in evidence of documents subpoenaed from the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. The court overruled the objection and admitted the documents into evidence. The prosecutor offered into evidence affidavits regarding the procedures used by the DMV to notify drivers by mail of suspension of a driver's license in order to meet &sect; 511(1)(a)'s requirement of proof that an operator knew that his license was suspended. . The defendant argued that the affiants lacked personal knowledge that the notices were issued and mailed. The court held that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 214 provided that the affiants need not have had personal knowledge concerning the notices. The court rejected the argument that &sect; 214 violated the defendant's right of confrontation because he was denied the opportunity to cross-examine the affiants. The court held that the legislature could create a statutory exception to the hearsay rule and that &sect; 214 could provide a proper exception because the affiants were public officials with no motive to lie.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the defendant's objection and admitted the affidavits.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 214, which provides that an affidavit of a designated employee of the Department of Motor Vehicles, &quot;setting forth the procedure for the issuance and the mailing of [a] notice of suspension or revocation&quot; is &quot;presumptive evidence that such notice of suspension or revocation was produced and mailed in accordance with such procedures&quot;, thereby relieving the prosecution from providing personal knowledge of the mailing of the notice, does not violate a defendant's constitutional right of confrontation. Since the affidavits of regularity made by public officials in the furtherance of public duties with no motive to distort the truth, they are sufficiently reliable and trustworthy to form exceptions to the hearsay rule. Moreover, the statute does not violate due process or deprive a defendant of a fair trial since the statute only creates a presumption of mailing which may be rebutted by the defendant.</SPAN></P>

However, the abstract is admissible under CPLR 4520 and the common-law public records exception to the hearsay rule. Where a public officer is required or authorized by statute (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 354) or the nature of his duty to keep records or to make reports of acts or transactions occurring in the course of his official duty, those records or reports are admissible in evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city of New York had promulgated &sect; 2.5-a of the Highway Rules and Regulations that sought to prohibit the installation of magazine bins on sidewalks for the purpose of distributing materials that were deemed commercial speech. The city then instituted an action against the course offeror and the publisher pursuant to this regulation that sought to prohibit them from displaying their magazine on the sidewalk because it was commercial speech. In response, the course offeror and the publisher had made a motion for summary judgment, and the court granted the motion. The court found the magazine was not commercial speech because it could not be said that it did no more than propose a commercial transaction, although the primary purpose of the publication was to showcase the courses that were offered. Next, the court found the city's regulation was unconstitutional because it was clearly content-based. Further, the city had not demonstrated that its interest in cleanliness, aesthetics, health, and safety could not be achieved by a regulating scheme that rationally limited the number and location of the bins rather than totally banning them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Distribution of Magazine Via Bins on Sidewalks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A regulation of the City of New York banning the distribution of materials constituting commercial speech through bins on sidewalks does not legally authorize the city to prohibit defendants from installing devices on sidewalks for the distribution and display of a magazine which advertises defendants' courses in a wide variety of academic and life experience subjects since the publication, although containing elements of commercial speech, also contains features and articles not related to defendants' courses, and is thus entitled to full constitutional noncommercial speech protection.  In any event, the content-based regulation is unconstitutional since the city has failed to demonstrate that its interest in cleanliness, aesthetics, health and safety cannot be achieved by a regulating scheme which rationally limits the number and location of the receptacles for distributing commercial speech; nor has the city established interests of sufficient magnitude to override the countervailing interests established by the First Amendment and the public's right to be informed.  </SPAN></P>

It was guilty of violating the licensing provisions of &sect; 6 by soliciting in the village without first receiving the license. The village had the power to institute reasonable licensing requirements as a condition to solicitation and canvassing there. The licensing provisions were enforceable, operative, and viable. The time restriction did not pass constitutional requirements. Protection of residents against crime did not justify the preclusion of canvassing or soliciting at any time on a Saturday or Sunday. Insufficient evidence supported a prevention of crime basis for sustaining the outright ban on soliciting on weekends. The hours restriction was severable. The ordinance as written proscribed soliciting at homes listed under &sect; 7. The organization was not given a copy of the list, so it was not guilty of violating the list provision.</SPAN></P>

Law &sect;&sect; 170.30(1)(a) and 170.35(1)(c) to dismiss the charge of criminal contempt in the second degree on the ground that N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested while picketing on a public street outside of a grocery store. Defendant argued that, even though N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 215.50(3) did not directly seek to suppress certain speech, it was still violative of the First Amendment because it served as the basis for the prosecution of those who engage in nonlabor picketing but not for those engaged in labor picketing. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of criminal contempt in the second degree. The court held that N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 751(1) contained no exemption for cases involving or growing out of a labor dispute. Section 215.50(3) did not violate defendant's right to equal protection. The disparate treatment of picketers satisfied the substantial state interest test. The practice of collective bargaining in the Labor Law was an exercise of the police power of the state for the protection of the public welfare. It was rational for the legislature to conclude that the sanctions of the Judiciary Law were sufficient to regulate labor picketers since labor picketers were generally organized, identifiable, and answerable to a union that was also subject to the court's authority.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Contempt -- Criminal Contempt -- Nonlabor Picketing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penal Law &sect; 215.50 (3), which exempts from prosecution for criminal contempt in the second degree some labor demonstrators whose conduct may be in violation of a court order, is not constitutionally infirm for providing preferential treatment to labor picketing over other forms of peaceful picketing since labor picketing is punishable under a complementary statute (Judiciary Law &sect; 750), thereby resulting in equality of treatment.  The fact that a person convicted for contempt under the Penal Law is subject to greater punishment than a labor picketer convicted of Judiciary Law contempt does not violate equal protection since the disparate punishment of labor and nonlabor picketers grows out of a statutory scheme to regulate labor in private industry, a substantial State interest.  It is rational for the Legislature to conclude that the sanctions of the Judiciary Law are sufficient to regulate labor picketers since such picketers are generally organized, identifiable and answerable to a union, which is also subject to the court's authority.  Accordingly, defendant may be prosecuted for violating a court order prohibiting all picketing within 50 feet of a grocery store being boycotted.  </SPAN></P>

The mother filed a cross-motion questioning the validity of the N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act art. V, &sect; 516.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother brought a paternity action in 1982. The parties reached a binding agreement under art. V, &sect; 516 (Act). In 1989, the mother initiated an action to void the agreement and alleged that it was reached by coercion. The hearing examiner found that there was no physical or mental disability on the mother's part at the time of the agreement. The mother then initiated a declaratory action and questioned the constitutionality of the Act. The father filed a motion to dismiss. The court denied the motion on the basis that because it was a declaratory action, a declaration rather than dismissal, was appropriate. The court stated that the Act as it applied to the parties should be viewed in the scientific light of 1982, rather than in consideration of the scientific advances in DNA testing in 1989. The court found that the heightened scrutiny test applied to the review of the Act's constitutionality. The Act encouraged fathers to settle paternity claims while achieving a binding effect and protecting mothers and children by mandating review and approval of the agreements by a court. Therefore, the Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family Court Act &sect; 516, as extant and applied between the parties with respect to court-approved paternity agreements executed in 1982, in which defendant admitted paternity and committed himself to pay support but which made no provision for future modification, is constitutional.  Section 516, which provides that a paternity agreement for the support of an out-of-wedlock child and the mother is binding upon them when the court approves such agreement after determining that adequate provision has been made and after notice and opportunity to be heard is given to the local welfare official, is not unconstitutional on the ground that it deprives out-of-wedlock children of the equal protection of modifiable support based on increased needs that in-wedlock children enjoy.  Any present day infirmity of the statute based on the recent and rapid evolution of the genetic sciences, which can now more easily and clearly establish paternity than was possible in 1982, must be left to the Legislature.  Moreover, the court must heed the constitutional protection against interference with contractual rights, especially in view of the judicial imprimatur of the order reflecting these contractual rights.  </SPAN></P>

Pub. Health Law &sect; 2520 et seq., which failed to provide funding for medically necessary abortions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">PCAP was enacted to provide funding for prenatal and postpartum services to women with incomes up to 185 percent of the poverty level. When a pregnant woman, who was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia, sought a medically recommended abortion, she was denied reimbursement through PCAP even though she was otherwise eligible for services under PCAP. The pregnant woman and others similarly situated, along with doctors, clinics, and advocacy groups challenged the constitutionality of PCAP. The court held that PCAP was violative of the state constitution's Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause but refused to fashion a remedy believing that this was best left to the legislature. PCAP violated the Due Process Clause because it conditioned the availability of medical assistance on the state-preferred choice of childbirth, which precluded an eligible woman from any real choice in the fundamental, and constitutionally protected, decision of whether to bear or beget a child. PCAP violated the Equal Protection Clause because it did not provide for equal participation in state benefits once such benefits were extended.</SPAN></P>

In excluding funds for all abortions, PCAP is facially deficient since it cannot fulfill its stated objective to combat infant mortality and promote healthier babies.  The selective, conduct-oriented financing scheme of PCAP impermissibly pressures an eligible indigent woman toward childbirth, thereby abridging a constitutionally protected right and possibly creating a serious risk to the woman's life and/or health.  PCAP violates the due process rights of an eligible woman for whom an abortion is medically necessary by leaving her with no real choice in the decision of whether to &quot;bear or beget a child&quot;.</SPAN></P>

The court granted defendant's motion. The court strictly construed the statute and found that &quot;incendiary device&quot; did not refer to any device capable of starting a fire, but was limited to what was commonly called a &quot;Molotov cocktail&quot;: a breakable container designed to explode or produce uncontained combustion upon impact, containing a flammable liquid with a wick or similar device.

The village also failed to demonstrate that the regulation was narrowly tailored to achieve such objectives.

The court was unable to save the subject ordinances through judicial construction by construing them in accordance with constitutional requirements.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged the appropriation on constitutional grounds.

The appropriation provided, in pertinent part, that the comptroller was authorized to withhold up to two percent of the monies received in any court pursuant to the STOP DWI program for costs incurred by the department in carrying its responsibilities with respect to such programs. The wording of the legislation specifically invested the comptroller with the discretion to collect any amount he saw fit, from nothing, to a maximum of two percent of the revenues received in any court within participating counties. Viewed in an historical perspective, the challenged appropriations provision would be a step back to an era preceding a 1925 constitutional amendment, which added N.Y. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, homeless, mentally ill individuals, brought two actions, one against defendant New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) and one against defendant governor, seeking a judgment declaring that the HHC and the governor violated their duties owing to the homeless, mentally ill individuals in failing to provide each discharged patient with a written service plan in compliance with N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaints against the HHC and the governor were on behalf of the homeless, mentally ill individuals who were discharged or conditionally released from hospitals without a written service plan, an assurance of residence, or other after care services. The court found that the HHC and the city failed to see that discharges from psychiatric hospitals operated by the HHC obtained appropriate housing. The court also found that it did not have to reach the question of whether there was a rational basis for the difference in benefits between patients discharged from the HHC hospitals and those leaving state facilities because other statutory provisions demonstrated that the HHC patients were to receive services similar to those required by N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 29.15(h). The court concluded that the HHC and the city had an obligation to see that the residences in which its discharged patients were living were adequate and appropriate to their needs.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) and the City of New York jointly have an obligation to see that dischargees from psychiatric hospitals operated by HHC obtain appropriate housing, since the success of in-patient care and treatment given to mentally ill persons is in large part dependent on their being able after discharge to reside in stable housing with available supportive services, and a discharge to the street, a congregate public shelter or a &quot;flop house&quot; would not constitute effective &quot;rehabilitation&quot; required to be given to such persons pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 7.07 (c), as those places are not appropriate residences in light of the dangers involved in such living arrangements.  Moreover, as a result of the implementation and monitoring requirements of Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 29.15 (h), the State has an obligation to see that dischargees from psychiatric facilities operated by the State Office of Mental Health obtain &quot;adequate and appropriate&quot; housing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In light of the acknowledgement by the State that, as a result of the implementation and monitoring requirements of Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 29.15 (h), it has an obligation to see that dischargees from psychiatric facilities operated by the State Office of Mental Health obtain &quot;adequate and appropriate&quot; housing, and that public shelters are not appropriate places to send patients, the court shall not issue an &quot;obey the law&quot; type of injunction against it where the proof showed that the number of instances where some of its patients did go to a shelter or other inappropriate residence was not great.  Moreover, the improper discharges resulted when patients left without leave, were released upon presenting a 72-hour letter demanding discharge, were discharged by court order, or refused offered residential recommendations </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 9.13 [b]; &sect; 9.31 [c]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Mental Health -- Placement of Discharged Mental Patients -- Municipal Dischargees to Receive Services Similar to State Dischargees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Dischargees from psychiatric hospitals operated by the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) are to receive services similar to those received pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 29.15 (h) by dischargees from State facilities, since HHC hospitals, being subject to licensure by the State Office of Mental Health, are governed by subdivisions (m) and (n) of Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 29.15 and, consequently, are required &quot;to cooperate&quot; with the city Department of Social Services in the &quot;preparation and implementation&quot; of discharge plans required under Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 29.15 (f).  Accordingly, although subdivision (n) does not contain the specificity of subdivision (h), the mandate of the two provisions is similar and, hence, more than merely giving a patient a piece of paper is required of HHC: the City of New York and HHC have an obligation to see that the residences in which its discharged patients are living are adequate and appropriate to their needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Mental Health -- Placement of Discharged Mental Patients -- Injunction Directing Municipal Agency to Comply with Mental Hygiene Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Inasmuch as the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) has an obligation to see that dischargees from its psychiatric hospitals obtain &quot;adequate and appropriate&quot; housing, it is appropriate for the court to direct compliance with that mandate since HHC, as an agency of government, has not satisfied the nondiscretionary duty imposed upon it by Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 29.15.  Moreover, in light of the social emergency emanating from the homeless crisis in New York City, the court would, even if the statute were not interpreted as imposing said mandate, direct that similar relief be granted.  Accordingly, judgment shall be settled declaring that HHC has violated its obligations with respect to discharge planning under Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 29.15 (f), (g), (m) and (n), and requiring compliance; however, in view of the fact that there is not now in existence sufficient available housing to enable HHC to immediately fully comply, the judgment shall provide for implementation over a period of time.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother filed a petition alleging that respondent father was the father of her child and sought an order of filiation and support. The father denied the allegations. The court made a preliminary determination that certain aspects of the case had raised questions about the constitutionality of N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 516.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother had filed a petition alleging that the father was the father of her son. A compromise agreement settling the claim of support had been consented to by the Commissioner of Social Services (DSS), the assignor of the mother, and the father. There was no record of any affidavit of service of the order upon the mother. The father filed a motion to dismiss the mother's petition pursuant to &sect; 516, on the grounds that a previous order had approved a compromise agreement regarding support of the child. On the return date for argument on the motion to dismiss, the father voluntarily withdrew his denial of paternity and entered an admission, but argued that so much of the petition as sought an order of support should be dismissed. An order of filiation was issued and the court made a preliminary determination that certain aspects of the case had raised questions about the constitutionality of &sect;516. The court denied the motion to dismiss the mother's petition for support. The court found that &sect; 516 as applied to the facts of the case was unconstitutional, in that the mother had been denied due process of law when the earlier compromise agreement had been approved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the father's motion to dismiss; and ordered that the father pay the mother an amount per week for temporary support of the child.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Support -- Notice to Out-of-Wedlock Mother of Submission of Settlement Proposal Regarding Father's Support Obligations to Court for Approval</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a filiation and support proceeding by petitioner mother against respondent putative father, respondent's motion to dismiss the petition pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 516 (c) on grounds that a prior, court-approved compromise agreement entered into between respondent and the Department of Social Services (to whom petitioner assigned her support rights as a condition of receiving public assistance) regarding the support of this child precludes maintenance of the instant proceeding, is denied.  Petitioner's assignment of her support rights to the Department of Social Services extends only to those rights during the period the child continues to receive public assistance; there is nothing in the applicable law which requires the assignor-mother to waive her right to support from the father, including the right to independent counsel during the pendency of the paternity proceeding and a de novo hearing on child support </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">once the child ceases to receive public assistance</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  Retention and exercise of these rights is meaningless unless the assignor-mother is given notice of and an opportunity to be heard in any proceeding for judicial approval of a compromise agreement. While there is no statutory requirement in Family Court Act &sect; 516 that the assignor-mother be given notice and an opportunity to be heard in any proceeding for judicial approval of a compromise agreement between the Department of Social Services and the putative father, such a requirement must be read into the statute in order to render it constitutionally sound and consistent with the tenets of due process.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of New York had a budget crisis, so the Mayor determined that budget reductions for all municipal services, including the Fire Department, were necessary. The Fire Department, by its Commissioner, elected to terminate a fire station in Queens based on its determination that surrounding fire companies could adequately protect the lives and property of the affected community. Petitioners filed an Article 78 proceeding to vacate respondents' determination, contending that it was arbitrary and capricious because nonessential municipal services should have been eliminated before essential services and that the affected community would not be afforded adequate protection. Respondents filed a cross motion to dismiss the petition. The court determined that the dispute was not justiciable, and even if it was justiciable, the court could not reverse respondents' determination because the court was not permitted to substitute its judgment for that of the body or officer empowered by statute to issue the determination, and the determination was based on objective data available to the Commissioner, sound fire protection principles, and was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, respondent city officials' motion to dismiss a CPLR article 78 petition to vacate their determination to close a firehouse is granted.  Moreover, even if the issue under consideration were justiciable, the standard of review pursuant to article 78 would not require reversal of the determination, since the determination was based on objective data and sound fire protection principles and was neither arbitrary nor capricious. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law art. 14, petitioners, the collective bargaining representatives to the state's court employees, sought to enjoin respondents from carrying out an alternative payment plan whereby certain court employees' wages were withheld. Petitioners sought a declaration that 1990 N.Y. Laws &sect; 375, which directed the withholding of wages from nonjudicial employees, was a violation of the state's constitution and laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees who wages were being withheld pursuant to 1990 N.Y. Laws &sect; 375 had had no opportunity to negotiate with respondents prior to their wages being lagged; other employees, under previous collective bargaining agreements, had been able to negotiate such withholding directives. Petitioners thus contended that the lag provisions, as passed, were in violation of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 and contrary to unfair labor practices and the right to bargain collectively under the state's Taylor Law. For an employer to withhold wages and use the employees' moneys for its own use conflicted with the basic concepts of labor law. The withholding of petitioners' wages for respondents' use compelled petitioners, who were public employees, to be respondents' financier. The court further noted that the lag provision was a tax designed and structured against the wage earner exclusively, to meet the needs of the general welfare. The financing by lag payments was simply a plan to deprive the workers from receiving their earned income. The court therefore declared 1990 N.Y. Laws &sect; 375 to be unconstitutional, and determined that petitioners were entitled to recover the withheld payments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared the challenged legislative provision to be unconstitutional, and concluded that petitioners were entitled to their respective payments in compliance with the former law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tenant filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant State Department of Taxation and Finance, challenging the right of the department to impose and collect sales tax on payments by the tenant to its landlord for overtime heating, ventilation and air conditioning. The tenant moved and the department cross-moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant sought an order declaring that the imposition of the New York State sales tax on heating, ventilation and air conditioning services provided by the landlord at the subject premises was invalid. The state sought dismissal of the complaint on the grounds that the tenant had failed to exhaust administrative remedies and because the action was not ripe for adjudication because there was a need to make a full record as to factual issue. The court held that: (1) the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies was inapplicable; (2) a declaratory judgment action was not subject to dismissal merely because the tenant was not entitled to the declaration it sought; (3) there was a justiciable controversy between the parties as to their rights and duties; (4) the tenant had made a prima facie showing that the imposition of commercial occupancy rent tax and sales tax on its overtime heating, ventilation and air conditioning payments constituted double taxation; and (5) the provision of overtime heating, ventilation and air conditioning services incidental to the provision of rented premises was not subject to a sales tax under N.Y. Tax Law &sect;1105 (b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted summary judgment to the tenant and declared that the provision of overtime heating, ventilation and air conditioning services incidental to the provision of rented premises was not subject to a sales tax under N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- Summary Judgment -- Opportunity to &quot;Make Record&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a declaratory judgment action by plaintiff, a commercial tenant, challenging the right of defendant State Department of Taxation and Finance to impose and collect sales tax on payments by plaintiff to its landlord for overtime heating, ventilation and air conditioning as being beyond defendant's statutory grant of power (Tax Law &sect; 1105 [b]), defendant's argument that the action is not ripe for adjudication, because there is a need to make a full record, is inappropriate in the context of plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. Defendant has failed to demonstrate the existence of a genuine triable issue of fact in opposition to plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. Merely requesting an opportunity to &quot;make a record&quot; without identifying any particulars as to what defendant hopes to discover or why it thinks the facts may be other than as attested to by plaintiff's expert is insufficient, and is tantamount to an impermissible request for a &quot;fishing expedition&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies -- Challenge to Power to Impose Sales Tax</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An action by plaintiff, a commercial tenant, challenging the right of defendant State Department of Taxation and Finance to impose and collect sales tax on payments by plaintiff to its landlord for overtime heating, ventilation and air conditioning as being beyond defendant's statutory grant of power (Tax Law &sect; 1105 [b]), will not be dismissed on the ground that plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies.  The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is inapplicable where, as here, an agency's action is challenged as wholly beyond the agency's grant of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Sales and Use Taxes -- Overtime Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant State Department of Taxation and Finance may not impose and collect a sales tax on payments by plaintiff, a commercial tenant, to its landlord for overtime heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) since overtime HVAC does not constitute a sale of gas, electricity, refrigeration or steam service as a matter of statutory construction.  The legislative intent in imposing a sales tax on &quot;electric, refrigeration and steam service of whatever nature&quot; (Tax Law &sect; 1105 [b]) was to tax all sales of utilities when sold as commodities or articles of commerce, not to tax the provision of heat and air conditioning to business premises but rather the products that are used to produce these results.  In addition, since plaintiff has already been subjected to New York City commercial rent or occupancy tax for its overtime HVAC payments, plaintiff should not be subjected to double taxation on its HVAC payments by imposition of a sales tax pursuant to section 1105 (b) in the absence of any specific provisions or statements of legislative intent evidencing that such services were also intended to be subject to a sales tax. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner State appealed the order of the City Court of Rochester (New York) dismissing criminal informations charging respondents with violations of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 245.01 governing exposure of a person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents were charged with violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 245.01 governing exposure of a person. The lower court found the statute constitutional in general, but unconstitutional as applied to respondents. Petitioner State appealed. Respondents claimed that because the statute denied exercise of their First Amendment right of freedom of speech, it was unconstitutional. The court found that respondents' nudity, in the context in which it occurred, was sufficiently expressive to rise to the level of communication of an idea. It held, however, that &sect; 245.01 could impinge on that chosen form of speech. The State was not foreclosed from regulating activity, provided that the statute furthered an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms was no greater than essential to furtherance of that interest. The court upheld the statute in issue as a permissible state exercise in regulating a person's First Amendment right to express an opinion on the basis of time, place, and manner. It therefore reversed the lower court and remitted the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the lower court dismissing the informations against respondents was reversed because the penal statute in issue was not unconstitutional as applied to respondents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Gender Based Bias -- Public Nudity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State may treat males and females differently and not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions provided the unequal treatment is substantially related to the achievement of an important governmental concern.  Accordingly, since the State's objective in the passage of Penal Law &sect; 245.01, which applies unequally to women on the basis of their gender by prohibiting exposure of their breasts in public while not prohibiting a similar display by men, is substantially related to the achievement of the important governmental concern of protecting the public from invasions of its sensibilities, the statute is constitutional as written.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Actions as Speech -- Public Nudity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Actions can be deemed sufficiently expressive as to rise to the level of communication of an idea, thus giving rise to constitutional free speech considerations.  Accordingly, since the respondents' public removal of their shirts occurred in the context of a preannounced protest against the public nudity statute (Penal Law &sect; 245.01) which treats males and females differently, it was sufficiently expressive as to rise to the level of communication of an idea and consideration must be given as to whether enforcement of that statute can constitutionally be permitted to impinge upon this chosen form of speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Governmental Regulation of Actions Constituting Speech -- Public Nudity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Actions constituting speech may be regulated or even prohibited if such limitation furthers an important or substantial governmental interest, if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.  Accordingly, since the prohibition of public nudity is within the State's police power and furthers an important governmental interest, and since the statute prohibiting public nudity (Penal Law &sect; 245.01) is not directed toward suppressing the expression of public opinion concerning nudity, but instead neutrally prohibits all public displays of nudity regardless of the actor's purpose, the statute is constitutional as applied to the respondents, who violated the statute by removing their shirts to protest the statute's different treatment of males and females with respect to exposure of their breasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Public Exposure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It is the general purpose of a criminal statute to give fair warning of the nature of the conduct proscribed, while at the same time preventing arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by demanding boundaries sufficiently distinct for police to fairly administer the law.  Penal Law &sect; 245.01, which prohibits exposure of private or intimate parts of the body in public, and provides that the private or intimate parts of a female include that portion of the breast which is below the top of the aureola, satisfies that standard.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 401 in that he owned and operated a pickup truck over and along a public highway without first having registered the vehicle in accordance with the processes of article 14 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his vehicle was registered by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles as a passenger vehicle, and that he was not in violation of article 14. The court rejected defendant's vagueness argument finding that it was clear from N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 401 that he had notice that his vehicle was improperly registered. The court found that the pickup truck was not altered extensively, and that defendant testified that the vehicle did not come within the definition of &quot;suburban,&quot; which was the classification under which it was registered under &sect; 401(6). Defendant testified that he did not recall what information he provided the Department of Motor Vehicles at the time of registration nor did he recall whether or not he stated in his application that the vehicle in question was in fact a truck or a pickup. The court found that defendant was fully aware that his vehicle was improperly registered as a &quot;suburban&quot; vehicle, that it should have been registered as a commercial vehicle, and that the &quot;suburban&quot; registration issued to him was based on the representations made by him to the Department.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that the Department of Motor Vehicles allowed defendant to register his pickup truck with passenger plates rather than commercial plates does not prevent his conviction for operating an improperly registered vehicle in violation of section 401 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, since defendant was fully aware that the vehicle was improperly registered and the registration was issued on the basis of defendant's representations on the registration application forms (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 401 [1] [b]).  Moreover, the statute is not unconstitutional on grounds of vagueness or failure to provide notice since defendant had clear notice from the statutory definition of both &quot;truck&quot; and &quot;suburban&quot; motor vehicle that his pickup truck was improperly registered as a &quot;suburban&quot; vehicle (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 401 [6]) when it should have been registered as a commercial vehicle. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's mate alleged that he and the decedent had lived together in a spousal-type relationship in New York for approximately four years and that their relationship was identical to that of husband and wife. He further alleged that the only reason they were not legally married was that they could not obtain a marriage license. The court held that the decedent's mate did not have a right or standing to elect against the decedent's will under N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 5-1.1. It also held that it was not unconstitutional to prohibit persons of the same sex from entering into marriage with each other. New York had a compelling interest in fostering the traditional institution of marriage for procreation and for providing status and stability to the environment in which children were raised. Also, there was no authority in any United States jurisdiction either authorizing same-sex marriages or elevating homosexual unions to the same level achieved by marriage. Further, the restriction on the right to marry people of the same sex had a rational basis and did not offend the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or due process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survivor of a homosexual relationship, alleged to be a &quot;spousal relationship&quot;, cannot claim spousal rights against the decedent's will pursuant to, or similar to those granted by, EPTL 5-1.1.  Persons of the same sex have no constitutional rights to enter into marriage with each other and neither due process nor equal protection of law provisions are violated by prohibiting such marriages. Further, to grant rights to the survivor of a homosexual &quot;spousal relationship&quot; similar to those granted to a surviving husband or wife by the Legislature would amount to impermissible judicial legislation and be contrary to the public policy expressed by the Legislature.  Accordingly, notwithstanding the fact that decedent and petitioner, members of the same sex, allegedly lived in a spousal-type relationship, kept a common home, shared expenses, had a physical relationship and were recognized as spouses by their friends, those factors do not give rise to any right of election on the part of petitioner pursuant to EPTL 5-1.1 with respect to the decedent's will.  </SPAN></P>

Fam. Ct. Act art. 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal alleged that the student was incorrigible and beyond the control of his parent and other lawful authority. The principal also alleged that the student was involved in a physical confrontation in the school hallway with another student, the student was involved in a number of other specific incidents at the school, and that he walked out of a PINS assessment and refused to return to complete the assessment. The entire factual basis for the petition was stated to be &quot;upon information and belief,&quot; and the source of that belief was stated to be the school records. No supporting depositions or other documents were annexed or made a part of the petition. The student filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that it did not contain any nonhearsay allegations that related to the misconduct charged. The court granted the motion. The court held that the distinction between the liberty interests at stake in a juvenile delinquency proceeding when compared to those at stake in a PINS proceeding, was not sufficiently great to permit the student to be prosecuted on a petition based purely on hearsay allegations of misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The distinction between the liberty interests at stake in a juvenile delinquency (JD) proceeding when compared to those at stake in a proceeding involving a person in need of supervision (PINS) is not sufficiently great to permit a juvenile alleged to be a PINS to be prosecuted on a petition based on allegations set forth in a less reliable form than that required by the New York statutory scheme established for a child alleged to be a JD.  Thus, the failure of section 732 of the Family Court Act to require that the allegations of misconduct in a PINS petition be in nonhearsay form violates the respondent's equal protection rights, but does not compel that the statute be declared unconstitutional since the deficiency can be cured by reading the fundamental requirements of Family Court Act &sect; 311.2 into article 7.  Accordingly, the PINS petition, filed by petitioner school principal, which is based upon information and belief and refers to school records that are not attached, is jurisdictionally defective and, since the court lacks the power to authorize an amendment under such circumstances, the petition is dismissed without prejudice to further submissions in proper and sufficient form.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought dismissal of criminal charges for endangering the welfare of a child under N.Y. Penal Law &sect;260.10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss, for legal insufficiency, charges brought under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 260.10 for endangering the welfare of a child. The charges stemmed from defendant's action in pointing a gun at the child's mother when the child was at her side. The court denied the request. It found that the State's allegations were sufficient to establish a prima facie charge of endangering the welfare of a child, based on the requirements of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law. &sect;&sect;100.15, 100.40. Providing further detail was the function of a bill of particulars.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Endangering Welfare of Child -- Sufficiency of Accusatory Instrument</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An accusatory instrument, the factual portion of which alleges that defendant pointed a gun at and threatened the complaining witness while her 11-year-old daughter was standing next to her, is legally sufficient to establish a prima facie charge of endangering the welfare of a child (Penal Law &sect; 260.10), thus necessitating denial of defendant's motion to dismiss. While certain cases have held that section 260.10 was designed only to protect children from persons exerting some influence or control over them and is not applicable to behavior directed towards others no matter how detrimental the ultimate effect, there is no such limitation in the statute.  Indeed, the history of section 260.10 makes clear that it is intended to protect minors from more than just physical risk.  The facts alleged sufficiently satisfy section 260.10's mental culpability requirement that defendant &quot;knowingly act in a manner likely to be injurious to the physical, mental or moral welfare of a child.&quot; It takes little imagination, in this instance, to be aware that pointing a gun at a person with the threat of using it will also endanger, frighten and traumatize a child standing alongside. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with setting a fire in public in violation of New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 27-4249, after burning a cloth flag in front of a courthouse. He contended that the summons should be dismissed because its issuance impermissibly precluded him from exercising his constitutionally protected right to burn the flag as a form of protest, and further that &sect; 27-4249 was impermissibly vague and overbroad. The court dismissed the summons. It held that as applied to defendant's conduct, the provision was unconstitutional because in the absence of any real threat to public safety, the police had no legitimate interest unrelated to the suppression of expression for issuing the summons.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 27-4249 (a) of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, which makes it &quot;unlawful for any person to kindle, build, maintain or use a fire upon any land * * * within the jurisdiction&quot; of the city, although not facially invalid or impermissibly vague and overbroad, is nonetheless unconstitutional as applied to defendant's conduct in burning a flag as a form of protest in front of the criminal courthouse, in the absence of any proof of a compelling public safety reason for the issuance of summonses to defendant charging violations of section 27-4249 (a).  The act of flag burning in order to convey a message is a form of political expression that is entitled to constitutional protection. The primary interest of the police in issuing the summonses to defendant was to suppress defendant's politically charged acts of burning the flag. Such a purpose is inconsistent with the First Amendment and cannot be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution. Although the police may have some right to regulate the time, place and manner of a flag burning, they may not prohibit it entirely merely because it occurs on public property.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a commercial landlord, brought the action for a declaratory judgment to determine whether the department was authorized to assess sales taxes for electricity rent charges paid by the taxpayer's tenants. Considering the taxpayer's motions for a preliminary injunction and summary judgment and the department's motion to dismiss the case, the court first held that the taxpayer was not required to exhaust administrative remedies before litigating the matter in court. The taxpayer was challenging the constitutionality of the tax and the department's authority to issue the tax. The court then noted that under state statutes, the sale of electricity and commercial rents were taxed separately. Construing the statutes liberally in favor of the taxpayer and to avoid double taxation, the court concluded that the department was not authorized to impose sale tax on the redistribution of electricity by the landlord to its tenants, who paid commercial occupancy tax as well. This would have amounted to double taxation. The court granted the taxpayer's motions for summary judgment and a preliminary injunction and denied the department's motion to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff, the lessor of commercial office space, may maintain a declaratory judgment action challenging the imposition or amount of tax on rent inclusion charges paid by commercial tenants for nonmetered electricity without first exhausting administrative remedies and then bringing a CPLR article 78 proceeding, since plaintiff is not challenging the amount of the tax allegedly owed, but, rather, is challenging the right of the defendant taxing authorities to impose and collect the sales tax, an issue that is one of pure statutory analysis that can be decided as a matter of law. Similarly, since plaintiff is challenging the applicability or constitutionality of a taxing statute and is not challenging the correctness of the amount of defendants' determination of its tax liability, the exclusive remedy provisions of Tax Law &sect; 1140 do not preclude a declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Sales and Use Taxes -- Nonmetered Electricity Rent Inclusion Charges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The State and municipal taxing authorities lack the statutory authority to impose and collect sales tax on the nonmetered electricity rent inclusion charges paid by plaintiff's commercial tenants since the imposition of sales tax on the redistribution of electricity by plaintiff to its tenants, who pay New York City's commercial occupancy rent tax as well, would amount to double taxation. Defendant taxing authorities have failed to overcome the presumption against such double taxation, particularly in the face of the undisputed practice over several decades of not having treated the redistribution of unmetered electricity by a landlord to commercial tenants as a &quot;sale&quot; or &quot;resale&quot; (Tax Law &sect; 1105 [b]).  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The requirement contained in Town Law &sect; 209-e (3) that a voter in a special election or referendum concerning the extension of an improvement district subject to the provisions of Town Law article 12-A be an owner of real property situate in the proposed extended district passes constitutional muster since passage of the extension would have a disproportionate effect or special burden on such landowners, whose property alone would be subject to assessments and charges for the benefits conferred, and also to liens for delinquencies.  Accordingly, a special election on extending a sanitation collection district was invalid where nonlandowners were permitted to vote, since those votes contaminated the election result, making it impossible to determine whether a majority of those properly entitled to vote approved the proposition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Restriction of the franchise in a special election to the owners of taxable real property in a proposed extended improvement district subject to the provisions of Town Law article 12-A does not operate to extend the franchise to noncitizens who own such real property, since noncitizens may not vote in contravention of Election Law &sect; 5-102 (1), which provides that no person shall be qualified to vote at any election unless he is a citizen of the United States and 18 years of age or older; while other procedural requirements applicable to general elections are not strictly required for special town elections, no authority dispensing with age or citizenship requirements has been presented.  Accordingly, in a special election to determine whether a sanitation collection district should be extended, noncitizens were properly excluded from voting, even though landowners </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Town Law &sect; 209-e [3]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- Special Election -- Procedural Requirements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A special election held by a town to determine whether a sanitation collection district should be extended was not invalid on the ground that the town failed to follow a direction that a copy of the resolution/order directing a public hearing be posted and published with the notice of hearing, where no prejudice was claimed as a result of that minor deviation and it appears that the information contained in the resolution was made public by other means.  Moreover, although strict compliance with the Election Law is not required for a local special election not held at the time of a general election (Election Law &sect; 1-102), some method of properly identifying voters should be instituted where registration is not required and signatures cannot be matched to election &quot;buff&quot; cards; inasmuch as petitioners, who seek to invalidate the referendum, have not indicated any fraudulent practice in the election in question, the failure to obtain the signatures of several of the voters would not constitute grounds for annulling the referendum. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and indicted for the murder of his mother. Defendant proposed to post bail secured by real property and challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The value of the of the house that defendant proposed to use to secure the bond for his bail was greater than the amount of the bail but not twice the amount of the bail as required by N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 500.10(17)(b). Defendant argued that &sect; 500.10(17)(b) was unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions and it was irrational as a matter of law. The court dismissed defendant's equal protection claim because the statute did not clearly make invidious distinctions between classes of citizens based on race and where there was no fundamental constitutional right involved, wealth was not a classification that warranted the strict scrutiny equal protection review. However, the court found that there was no rational basis for the heightened requirements of &sect; 500.10(17)(b). The evils that the requirement sought to dispel when the requirement was enacted into law 50 years earlier, particularly unscrupulous bail bondsmen, no longer existed. Section 500.10(17)(b) also conflicted with the policy of in favor of granting a defendant pretrial liberty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bail -- Bail Bonds -- Bond Secured by Real Property -- Irrationality of Double Equity Requirement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  CPL 500.10 (17), which provides that a bail bond may be secured by personal property with a value over and above all liabilities and encumbrances equal to the amount of the undertaking, but requires real property securing a bond to be worth twice the amount of the undertaking, is irrational as a matter of law.  The double equity requirement was enacted to deal with the &quot;evil&quot; of unscrupulous bail bondsmen who would secure bail bonds with &quot;undesirable&quot;, i.e., already pledged, property, but no rational relationship exists between the gravity of those &quot;evils&quot; and the contextual purpose of the modern statute.  The double equity requirement visits a heavy and irretrievable burden not upon offending professional bail bondsmen, but upon an accused possessed of little resource where a court, despite an inclination to release a &quot;good risk&quot; defendant, feels impelled to fix bail in an amount reflective of the factual matters that must be taken into account.  In the case of the instant defendant, a teenager accused of murdering his mother, there is neither overreaching nor fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Presumptions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A legislative enactment is cloaked with a strong presumption of constitutionality and while the presumption is rebuttable, its challengers bear the heavy burden of proving the questioned legislation unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.  Judicial review of a challenged statute revolves about an inquiry as to whether any state of facts known or to be assumed justifies the disputed measure, and where statutory language is clear and unambiguous, interpretation of the statute must give effect to the words used by a coequal branch of government, unless such application would cause an anachronistic or absurd result contrary to the contextual purpose of the enactment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bail -- Bail Bonds -- Bond Secured by Real Property -- Double Equity Requirement -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  CPL 500.10 (17), which provides that a bail bond may be secured by personal property with a value over and above all liabilities and encumbrances equal to the amount of the undertaking, but requires real property securing a bond to be worth twice the amount of the undertaking, does not violate the equal protection rights of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans, who allegedly lack liquid assets and must rely on bonds secured by real property, since the mere conjecture of a denial of equal protection need not, in the absence of evidence of invidious distinctions between classes of citizens, be subject to the strict review scrutiny otherwise required where purposeful unequal treatment or resulting disproportionate harm is alleged.  In the absence of a stark pattern that a statute bears more heavily on one race or ethnic group than upon another, impact alone is not determinative of whether there has been a violation of equal protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bail -- Right to Bail -- Right to Have Bail Determined in Accordance with Law -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There is no per se absolute right to bail; there is only a right to have bail determined in accordance with law, and bail is not considered to be excessive merely because a defendant cannot furnish it.  Accordingly, for purposes of an equal protection challenge, the double equity provision of CPL 500.10 (17) (b), which requires that real property securing a bail bond be worth at least twice the amount of the undertaking, can hardly be classified as an implicit &quot;fundamental right&quot; or based upon a showing of suspect criteria, which must then be construed to be of constitutional dimension.  The applicable measure, therefore, must be the &quot;rational basis&quot; standard of review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Judicial Oversight -- Changed Conditions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In reviewing the constitutionality of a statute, judicial oversight of the motives of a legislature is hazardous and courts are not free to invalidate a challenged statute because of disagreement over legislative wisdom, or to substitute their opinion for the judgment of the legislature.  Moreover, the constitutionality of an act depends on its real character, its practical operation and effect, rather than on its professions of purpose, and in examining the question, reference must necessarily be had to subsequent developments which may have changed the validity of information before the legislature at the time of its enactment.  Consequently, legislation valid when adopted will nevertheless fall as invalid when, at a later time, its operation under changed conditions proves unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bail -- Bail Bonds -- Bond Secured by Real Property --</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Double Equity Requirement -- Fluctuation in Value of Security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  CPL 500.10 (17), which provides that a bail bond may be secured by personal property with a value over and above all liabilities and encumbrances equal to the amount of the undertaking, but requires real property securing a bond to be worth twice the amount of undertaking, anachronistically lacks a discernable connection to a commonsense interpretation of revised legislative intent, as well as not comporting with it.  Although the Legislature wanted to safeguard the &quot;adequacy&quot; of a bond's security, given that its later wisdom afforded a defendant liberty merely by having him incur a legal obligation under the form of an unsecured bond, the double equity requirement, seen as an aid in the enforcement and collection of forfeitures, sweeps too broadly.  Moreover, although it was feared that real property might fluctuate notoriously, today stocks and bonds, which are subject to far more wild fluctuations than real estate, may secure a bail bond at their equity value ( CPL 500.10 [17] [a]).  Inasmuch as the record reveals no substantial State interest in the face of a requirement that more than incidentally interferes with defendant's personal liberty, the double equity requirement is facially invalid.  </SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 26-514.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents determined that the landlords had reduced essential services to their tenants, so respondents ordered a rent reduction and a rent freeze pursuant to &sect; 26-514. The landlords claimed that the sanctions against them were excessive, so they filed a petition to vacate respondents' orders. But the court held that the imposition of the rent reduction and rent freeze was mandatory upon the finding of the reduction in essential services, so the landlords' assertion of their good faith effort to improve services to the tenants was irrelevant. The court further rejected the landlords' claim that the amount of the sanctions were excessive holding that the amount of the sanctions were high only because of the number of tenants who were entitled to individual compensation pursuant to &sect; 26-514. The court also held that &sect; 26-514 was not unconstitutional as applied to the landlords because the application of the statute was reasonably related to the statutory goal of compelling a landlord to restore services and affording tenants a measure of compensation for the period that those services were not provided.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statutory sanctions in the form of retroactive rent reductions and rent freezes estimated at over $ 750,000 imposed on petitioner landlord by respondent State Division of Housing and Community Renewal for reduction of essential services pursuant to Rent Stabilization Law (Administrative Code of City of New York) &sect; 26-514 are not excessive, or disproportionate to the wrong, are reasonably related to the statutory purpose, and are constitutional as applied.  Although the monetary amount which petitioner must pay is very large, it is not excessive or disproportionate to the wrong; the reduction in essential services extended over a long period of time and affected a large number of tenants, resulting in each complaining tenant receiving an average refund of $ 43.55 per month for reduced services and each noncomplaining tenant receiving an average refund of $ 5.81 per month, and these refunds are clearly not excessive. The sanctions are reasonably related to the statutory goals of compelling a landlord to restore services, affording tenants a measure of compensation, and preservation and maintenance of the rental housing stock in New York City.  Accordingly, the landlord's CPLR article 78 proceeding to vacate respondent's order on the ground that the sanctions imposed are excessive and so disproportionate to the offense as to render Rent Stabilization Law &sect; 26-514&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Clear legislative intent is required in order to give retroactive application to an act of the Legislature when said act creates a cause of action where none previously existed, and said retroactive application of such statute is not unconstitutional because of the retroactive effect. Accordingly, where the history, as well as the literal words of a Session Law (L 1990, ch 762), clearly express that a statute creating a cause of action for police officers injured while on duty </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, General Municipal Law &sect; 205-e) be retroactively applied, no court interpretation of legislative intent is required.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.

The Legislature having clearly expressed its intent that the statute be applied retroactively to include all cases dismissed on or after January 1, 1987, and the prior claim having been finally determined in March 1988, said claim comes within the aforementioned provision of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The Legislature does not have the right to infringe upon the vested rights established by a final judgment of the courts of New York.  Accordingly, Laws of 1990 (ch 762), which amended Laws of 1989 (ch 346), which enacted General Municipal Law &sect; 205-e providing a right of action to police officers injured while on duty as a result of a defendant's negligence in failing to observe any statute, ordinance, regulation, etc., is unconstitutional to the extent that it be retroactively applied to revive a claim against the State asserted by police officers injured while attempting to arrest an escaped mental patient, where the claim was dismissed by the Court of Claims in 1985, where Laws of 1990 (ch 762) revived claims &quot;which [were] dismissed on or after January 1, 1987 because [section 205-e] was not yet effective&quot;, where Laws of 1989 (ch 346) was made effective July 12, 1989, and where final judgment dismissing the claims by the Court of Appeals was not rendered until March 1988, since public policy, which defines public interest, is not served by retroactively applying the legislation to the instant claims in light of the necessity to preserve and protect public funds from unwarranted and nonmeritorious claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- Res Judicata -- Revival of Barred Claims -- Public Policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Res judicata is not applicable to a claim against the State brought by police officers to recover damages sustained while attempting to arrest an escaped mental patient where the claim was initially dismissed, since the statutory rights of the parties have been altered in the intervening period between the conclusion of the first claim and the commencement of the present action owing to the enactment of legislation creating a cause of action in favor of police officers injured as a result of a defendant's negligence in failing to observe statutes, regulations, etc. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, General Municipal Law &sect; 205-e) and giving section 205-e retroactive effect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, L 1990, ch 762).  In the dismissal of the initial claim, the State acquired the vested right not to expend public funds to compensate claimants, and that vested right, which is inviolate, may not constitutionally be waived.  Moreover, section 205-e, as amended, did not change the public policy as to common-law negligence, but simply places police officers on the same footing as firemen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, General Municipal Law &sect; 205-a); thus, in the absence of any change in public policy, which defines public interest, it cannot be said that the public interest is served by retroactively applying the legislation to the present claim.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with multiple counts of statutory sodomy in the third degree and statutory rape. He filed a motion seeking a declaratory judgment that &sect; 130.05(3)&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived him of his right to have the People prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The court denied the motion and ruled that the statute was constitutional. Although concluding that defendant did not have standing to assert the victim's privacy interests, the court chose to decide the privacy issue. It ruled that the State had a compelling interest in protecting its youth, particularly from sexual exploitation. The State also had the authority to regulate the sexual conduct of its minors by setting age limits. Accordingly, the statute was not unconstitutional on privacy grounds. Neither did the statute deprive defendant of his right to have the People prove each element. Lack of true consent of those under 17 was not an element of the substantive crimes but was a presumption. It was equivalent to a substantive rule of law and was expressed in terms of the rules of evidence. Once the victim's age was proven, the People had established the element of lack of consent.</SPAN></P>

In addition, while defendant, charged with statutory sodomy and statutory rape (Penal Law &sect; 130.40 [2]; &sect; 130.25 [2]), has standing to challenge the statute on due process grounds, he has failed to establish that the statutory presumption unconstitutionally removes the element of consent from the related crimes, thereby depriving him of his right to have the People prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Penal Law &sect; 130.05 (3) (a) is a statutory legal definition; the lack of true consent of those under 17 years is not an element of the substantive crime. Once the People prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim's age was less than 17 at the time of the alleged offense, they have established lack of consent and the remaining &quot;elements&quot; of the crime must then be proved by the same degree of proof. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff union brought an action to enjoin defendant employer from violating &sect; 22-502 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York by hiring and transporting strikebreakers to replace striking employees. The matter was before the court on the union's motion for a temporary injunction and the employer's cross-motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union alleged that the employer violated &sect; 22-502(a), which prohibited strikebreakers from being hired, and &sect; 22-502(c), which prohibited strikebreakers from being transported to strike locations. The employer argued that the union's action was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151 et seq., because the local ordinance directly covered a labor-management question that fell under the ambit of the NLRA. The employer also contended that the local attempt to regulate the hiring of workers to replace striking employees violated the Supremacy Clause. The court held that the NLRA preempted the union's cause of action. The court reasoned that &sect;&sect; 22-502(a) and (c) both directly interfered with the implementation of the explicitly recognized and factually applicable right of an interstate employer to hire replacement workers under federal labor law principles. In view of their direct impact on the employer, the anti-hiring provisions in &sect; 22-502(a) could not be tangential to a labor dispute. In addition, there was no local interest sufficient to avoid preemption of the union's claim under the anti-transportation provisions in &sect; 22-502(c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the employer's cross-motion to dismiss the union's action to enjoin its alleged violation of local laws regulating the hiring and transportation of strikebreakers.

The hiring of workers to replace strikers is lawful under Federal law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was located at a naval training base by two detectives and questioned regarding his involvement in two robberies and the murder of a taxicab driver. Two Navy officers were present during the questioning. At his trial on charges of robbery and murder, defendant sought to suppress the statements on the ground that such questioning violated his constitutional rights under the Posse Comitatus Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1385 (act). The court denied the motion because the nature of the Navy's assistance in the case could not be characterized as military. At most, the Navy played a passive role in the civilian law enforcement activity. Defendant was also fully advised of both of the offenses of which he was suspected and of his Miranda rights, and the military personnel did not aid or otherwise participate in the questioning. Further, the act was not designed to afford protection to the rights of individuals under the circumstances of the case. Finally, the actions of all parties were reasonable and under the circumstances where the wrong that defendant sought to remedy was a technical statutory violation, the extraordinary measure of suppression was not applicable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's incriminating statements made to New York police officers at an out-of-State naval base where he was stationed should not be suppressed since the actions of naval personnel in rendering assistance to the police officers by escorting defendant to an interrogation room does not constitute the type of active military involvement prohibited by the Posse Comitatus Act (18 USC &sect; 1385), which proscribes the use of military personnel in civilian law enforcement. The military personnel simply extended the normal courtesies that they would be expected to extend to State law enforcement officials under the circumstances.  Even if the conduct of the naval authorities did violate the Federal act, suppression is not warranted since the remedy for a violation of the act is limited to criminal penalties, a fine of not more than $ 10,000, imprisonment for not more than two years, or both.  In addition, any violation of the act was merely technical and not willful so that the extraordinary remedy of suppression is unwarranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Counsel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant's uncounseled, but otherwise voluntary statements, made to New York police officers at an out-of-State naval base, should not be suppressed as the product of an illegal stratagem specifically designed to &quot;circumvent&quot; his right to counsel due to the failure of the police officers to secure an arrest warrant despite the existence of probable cause and despite their intention to secure an arrest warrant and arrest defendant regardless of whether he agreed to make a statement since defendant enjoys no constitutional right to be arrested and, thus, any deliberate attempt to &quot;circumvent&quot; his right to counsel cannot constitute grounds for suppression. </SPAN></P>

The police reports were not confidential or privileged. They were sought by defendants in preparation for trial, for information regarding favorable witnesses who would not be called to testify at trial and to disclose other unspecified exculpatory material. The state applied to quash the subpoenas. The court denied the application to quash. It held that it was prudent to disclose the subpoenaed police reports to the defense without delay in order to avoid continuous monitoring on the issue of materiality and the risk of reversible error for nondisclosure.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A defendant in preparation for trial may subpoena (CPL art 610) specific and routine police reports that are not confidential or privileged since, as a matter of due process of law, the defense is entitled to know before trial any exculpatory evidence, including potential evidence or leads to evidence, contained in the reports if there is a &quot;reasonable possibility&quot; that the specifically subpoenaed police reports would make a difference in the outcome of the trial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Vilardi</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 76 NY2d 67). To summarily quash subpoenas for specific police reports would unjustifiably ignore the fact that such reports by nature suggest a &quot;reasonable possibility&quot; that they will make a difference in the outcome of the trial.  Since the police department regularly provides all police reports to the prosecution, there should be no significant burden in supplying an extra copy for the defense when subpoenaed. In addition, reversal of convictions and costly retrials resulting from failures by the prosecution to disclose exculpatory evidence are avoidable by giving the defense pretrial access to police reports by subpoena. Accordingly, subpoenaed police reports should not be delivered to the defense until the prosecution has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect them and to make any reasonably necessary redactions to protect the identity of endangered witnesses, or undercover officers, or investigations in progress, and the like.  The court will intervene only as to any disputed redactions or representations of nonmateriality by the prosecution.  </SPAN></P>

The Legislature had a rational basis for such exemptions since the Legislature declared an emergency that called for prompt financing to improve transit facilities, and can be presumed to know that the environmental impact statement procedure can be subject to lengthy delays, that the contemplated financing could require that fare revenues serve as security, and that the transit authorities are required to have balanced budgets.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Commissioner of Social Services moved to amend the petition to substitute the estate administrator for respondent decedent, in a matter where the Commissioner, on behalf of petitioner mother, filed a paternity suit against the decedent and where the estate administrator cross-moved to dismiss pursuant to N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 519.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother claimed that she became pregnant when respondent decedent raped her at gunpoint. While N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 518 dealt with the situation of a mother's dying prior to the commencement of a proceeding, it was silent with respect to the death of a putative father prior to the commencement of a proceeding, irrespective of whether the putative father was the petitioner or the respondent. The only way to have the petition not be subject to abatement would be to hold the statute unconstitutional, which the mother and respondent Commissioner of Social Services did not attempt. The court found that a constitutional challenge would ultimately fail, as the biological reality justified the gender-based distinction in the Act that presumed the parentage of a mother, while requiring the relationship between a putative father and a child to be an established fact. The lack of knowledge about the subject was notably prejudicial to the decedent's family, since they would face insurmountable problems in preparing a defense since the claim implicates a highly unusual scenario for which apparently no independent corroboration exists.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to substitute and granted the cross-motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Children Born out of Wedlock -- Paternity Proceeding -- Effect of Death of Putative Father</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A gender-based enactment (Family Ct Act &sect; 519), which permits the granting of an order of filiation in a paternity proceeding after the death of the putative father provided some tangible articulable nexus existed between the child and deceased putative father (i.e., the putative father was the petitioner in the paternity proceeding; or the putative father acknowledged paternity of the child in open court; or a blood genetic marker test had been administered to the putative father prior to his death; or the putative father had openly and notoriously acknowledged the child as his own) is constitutional since the proper purpose of the statute of foreclosing false paternity claims, while allowing legitimate claims to proceed where a concrete connection between the decedent and the child can be specified, can only be accomplished, given biological realities, in a gender-based statute.  Accordingly, since petitioner Commissioner of Social Services, on behalf of the mother who claims to have become pregnant after being raped by the deceased putative father, a police officer, failed to establish the existence of any of the four specified circumstances, the paternity proceeding must be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant became boisterous when cinema security prevented him from cutting in line for a movie, shouting &quot;fuck you&quot; and &quot;eat this&quot; to police while grabbing his genitals. Such acts were in front of approximately 100 people including the arresting officer. Dismissing the information charging defendant with disorderly conduct, the court held that &sect; 240.20 (3) was unconstitutional. The court based such holding on a prior ruling striking down N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.25(2), the &quot;harassment&quot; statute, which was very similar to the disorderly conduct statute. Both statutes were overbroad because they did not limit their proscription of speech to &quot;fighting words.&quot; The court found that the variance between the statutes was a distinction without a difference.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Disorderly Conduct -- Use of Abusive or Obscene Language in Public Place</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disorderly conduct statute, which proscribes using &quot;abusive or obscene language&quot; or making an &quot;obscene gesture&quot; in a public place with &quot;intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 240.20 [3]), is unconstitutionally overbroad in view of the decision of the Court of Appeals striking down similar provisions of the harassment statute (Penal Law &sect; 240.40 [3]) on the ground that speech may neither be forbidden nor penalized unless it presents a clear and present danger of some serious substantive evil </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Dietze</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 75 NY2d 47). Any proscription of pure speech must be sharply limited to words which, by their utterance alone, inflict injury or tend naturally to evoke immediate violence or other breach of the peace. Accordingly, defendant may not be prosecuted for disorderly conduct for using vulgar language and making an obscene gesture when he was asked by police to leave a movie theatre after he tried to &quot;cut&quot; to the front of a long ticket line.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlord brought a holdover proceeding to evict respondents, tenant and tenant's children, on the ground that they were objectionable because they used or condoned the use of part of the premises, for the purpose of illegal activity. The landlord further sought possession against the tenant for harboring the two children. Finally, the landlord sought a restraining order or protective order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a tenant was removable, pursuant to a proceeding seeking to recover possession, if the landlord, by competent evidence, established to the satisfaction of the court that the tenant was objectionable. After the tenant's children had been arrested and convicted for drug offenses, the tenant allowed the children to live in her apartment. The court determined that the tenant of record was an objectionable tenant by condoning the illegal trade of drugs engaged in by her two children, in a part of the premises in which she lived, in violation of the law; and by harboring the two children after being informed of their illegal trading in narcotics. The court restrained the children from appearing at the premises or within 1000 feet of the premises.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a second indictment against defendant following reversal of defendant's conviction for riot in the second degree. The second indictment accused defendant of riot in the second degree and a new offense, discrimination. Defendant filed an omnibus motion seeking dismissal of the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the discrimination allegation of the second indictment violated N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 40.40, which barred a subsequent separate prosecution of an offense where it was not charged in the first indictment and there was evidence available to charge the offense not charged. The state argued that the law did not apply to the case before the court because a trial of the existing accusatory indictment had not begun nor had the indictment disposed of by a guilty plea. The court rejected the state's argument and dismissed the discrimination count. The court pointed out that the legislature's intent in enacting &sect; 40.40 was not to permit the state to add an additional offense once a trial had commenced on one offense involving the same conduct and the same evidence. The court also concluded that inclusion of the discrimination count at retrial was a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution because second prosecution in these circumstances raised the spectre of vindictiveness on the part of the state and would also have placed a chilling effect on defendant's right to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the discrimination charge contained in the second indictment because it denied defendant's constitutional rights under the due process clause, which was encompassed in spirit of the state's legislation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the criminal prosecution of a defendant who successfully appeals his conviction, once the original conviction is set aside and the prosecutor is granted leave to re-present the mater to a new Grand Jury, the prosecutor may not go into the Grand Jury and obtain an indictment which includes an additional offense based upon the same transaction and the same evidence that was in the People's possession prior to the finding of the first indictment, since the prosecution of the additional offense is barred by CPL 40.40 and the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution; CPL 40.40 prohibits separate prosecutions for offenses arising out of the same criminal transaction if they had been joinable in one accusatory instrument, and the intent of the Legislature was not to permit a prosecutor to add an additional offense once a trial had commenced on one offense involving the same conduct and the same evidence.  Moreover, by adding an additional charge, defendant is subjected to the possibility of increased punishment, and it is the fear of such greater punishment which may unconstitutionally deter defendant from exercising his right to appeal or to collaterally attack his first conviction.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An information alleged that defendant committed disorderly conduct by making an obscene statement to a police officer. The court granted defendant's motion and dismissed the information based on the unconstitutional overbreadth &sect; 240.20(3). The court held that &sect; 240.20(3) was unconstitutionally overbroad. It was so ambiguous that it could not have advised defendant that his statement could be prosecuted as disorderly conduct. If &sect; 240.20(3) were construed to include constitutionally permissible limits on the conduct that could be punished, its plain language would fail to inform a reasonable person of the conduct that was and was not prohibited. Therefore, it would fail to give fair warning of the nature of the conduct proscribed as required by N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1.05. If the court were able to construe N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.20(3) so as to establish constitutionally permissible limitations on its scope, the language complained of would necessarily fall outside of the scope of &sect; 240.20(3).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disorderly conduct statute, which proscribes using &quot;abusive or obscene language&quot; or making an &quot;obscene gesture&quot; in a &quot;public place&quot; with &quot;intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 240.20 [3]) is unconstitutionally overbroad in view of the unconstitutionality of the similar harassment statute, which requires an even greater mental culpability to sustain a conviction </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">People v Dietze</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 75 NY2d 47; Penal Law &sect; 240.25 [2]).  The fact that the harassment statute is designed to prevent alarm or annoyance to individuals, while the disorderly conduct statute protects against public disturbances or breaches of the peace does not require that the disorderly conduct statute be upheld for the greater public good since speech which is constitutionally protected may not be prohibited based on the number of listeners it reaches.  Accordingly, defendant, a striking employee, may not be convicted of disorderly conduct for making an obscene statement to a police officer. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the police department property clerk (the clerk), brought a forfeiture action in the Supreme Court of New York, New York County, against defendant arrestee. The arrestee filed a motion to dismiss the action and argued that the Administrative Code of the City of New York, which governed forfeiture proceedings, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestee's vehicle was seized pursuant to New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 14-140 after the arrestee and another individual used the vehicle to travel to a drug purchasing location. The forfeiture complaint filed by the clerk alleged that the vehicle was used by arrestee as the instrumentality of or to aid and further the commission of a crime. The arrestee challenged the Administrative Code provisions at issue and the court found that although those provisions still referred to his duty to prove his right to possession in a civil action, that language, which was previously deemed unconstitutional, was not dispositive where the clerk was required to show a right to forfeiture in the civil proceedings now used for forfeiture requests such as the one before the court. The arrestee failed to show that the forfeiture procedures utilized herein were so punitive in purpose or effect as to negate the legislature's implied purpose in enacting &sect; 14-140 to create a civil, remedial forfeiture statute. As a result, the civil proceeding brought to determine the right of possession were deemed constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the arrestee's motion to dismiss and found the New York City forfeiture provisions constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Forfeitures and Penalties -- Forfeiture of Proceeds or Instrumentality of Crime</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York City's forfeiture procedures, which authorize the Police Department Property Clerk to seize and retain possession of any property suspected of having been &quot;used as a means of committing crime or employed in aid or furtherance of crime&quot; (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 14-140), are not unconstitutional due to the lack of express language authorizing the institution of a forfeiture action as is constitutionally required by prior court decisions since the Property Clerk, as a legal claimant to the property, has the right to institute a suit declaring his custody and retention of the property to be lawful. The forfeiture procedures, although predicated on criminal behavior, are civil in nature rather than criminal, and, thus, a forfeiture proceeding does not amount to double jeopardy or violate constitutional safeguards against self-incrimination or deny due process.  There is no impropriety in the imposition of both criminal and civil penalties based on the same criminal acts. Accordingly, the Property Clerk may properly maintain a forfeiture proceeding to determine the right of possession to defendant's vehicle, which was seized in connection with defendant's arrest for possession of &quot;crack&quot; cocaine for which defendant eventually pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was fined $ 25.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New York State Legislature enacted Laws of 1989, as amended by Laws of 1990, that provided a procedure for the determination of whether the Borough of Staten Island should separate from the City of New York and become a separate city. Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment seeking a declaratory judgment that 1989 N.Y. Laws. 773 was violative of the home rule provision of the New York Constitution and the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions. Defendant cross-moved for a declaration of the law's validity. The court held that notwithstanding the serious impact of the proposed legislation on all the citizens of New York, it did not violate constitutional standards. It would ultimately be in the authority of the legislature to determine whether separation was in the best interests of the people of New York, including the residents of all the five boroughs. The court held that a state of facts could reasonably be conceived to justify the scheme set up by New York to commence the process given the limited nature of the election and disproportionate interest of Staten Islanders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The home rule message provision of the State Constitution (art IX, &sect; 2 [b] [2]), which provides that the Legislature may act in relation to the property, affairs or government of any local government only on request of the locality, does not prevent the State from responding to issues of significant State concern, and inasmuch as the Legislature has the power of municipal creation, Laws of 1989 (ch 773), which provides a procedure for determining whether the Borough of Staten Island should separate from the City of New York and become a separate city, does not fall within the ambit of those matters that require a home rule message. Issues of city boundaries and city creation are matters of significant State concern, and if the subject matter of a statute is of sufficient importance to the State generally to render it a proper subject of State legislation, the State may freely legislate, notwithstanding the fact that the concern of the State may also touch upon local matters.  The Legislature may consolidate, add to, or take from the territory of a municipality without its consent and without challenge.  Accordingly, there is a clear State concern herein and the enactment of chapter 773 embodies the plenary power of the Legislature that is expressly reserved to it for &quot;the creation and organization of local governments&quot; (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [a]).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Laws of 1989 (ch 773), which provides a procedure for determining whether the Borough of Staten Island should separate from the City of New York and become a separate city, and which authorizes only residents of Staten Island to vote in a referendum posing the secession question, is constitutionally valid and not a violation of equal protection since the referendum is advisory in nature, rather than determinative, with the State Legislature reserving to itself the power to ultimately decide whether the City of Staten Island is to be created.  If an election is of special interest, the State may limit the election to those who will be primarily affected, and the referendum in question serves a limited purpose: to appoint a committee to draft a proposed charter to use in the event that the Legislature votes to permit secession; this is not a situation in which those who are allowed to vote are exercising general governmental powers over those who are disenfranchised.  A rational basis for the enfranchisement of Staten Islanders, to the exclusion of other New York City residents, is readily apparent: Staten Islanders will be primarily affected by secession, despite the impact borne by the entire city.  </SPAN></P>

While eight-point type is not required for the notice, such notice must nevertheless appear on the face of the motion in a manner that will immediately call the defendant's attention to it.  In addition, the use of a rubber-stamp warning on the bottom right-hand side of the motion sheet does not satisfy the further statutory requirement that the warning for contempt be &quot;printed or type written&quot; in bold type.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed suit against defendants, state officials and city officials, regarding income taxes paid under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 612(c)(3). The taxpayers sought leave to renew and, upon renewal, the certification of their action as a class action, and they moved for partial summary judgment on their declaratory judgment claim. The state and the city officials moved for an order granting summary judgment dismissing the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to a federal decision, N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 612 (c)(3) was amended to exempt federal pension benefits from taxation. However, the amendment made no provision for retrospective relief for taxes paid on benefits received prior to January 1, 1989. The taxpayers filed their action. The court denied class certification, but granted partial summary judgment for the taxpayers on their declaratory judgment claim. Further, the court dismissed the taxpayers' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action, as well as their action for money had and received. However, it granted summary judgment for the taxpayers on their claim for injunctive relief. Class action status was inappropriate because the payment of taxes was personal. Under state law, the taxpayers were entitled to seek a refund for income taxes paid on their benefits from 1986 through 1989. The city, the city officials, or the state officials did not personally engage in any activity in connection with the taxation so as to give rise to a &sect; 1983 claim. Because the tax scheme was unconstitutional, taxpayers were entitled to injunctive relief. The taxpayers failed to comply with the protest requirement for their claim of money had and received.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action for declaratory and injunctive relief and a tax refund based upon a discriminatory, unconstitutional income tax scheme whereby, prior to January 1, 1989, the State and the City of New York taxed Federal pension benefits while exempting State and local pension benefits from taxation </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Tax Law &sect; 612 [c] [3] [ii]; Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 11-1712 [c] [3]), may not be maintained as a class action on behalf of all similarly situated taxpayers (CPLR 901, 902) since class action certification is inappropriate where governmental actions are involved and subsequent plaintiffs will be adequately protected under the doctrine of stare decisis.  Moreover, a tax voluntarily paid generally may not be recovered, and a class action may not be used to protect members of the proposed class who paid the tax without registering a protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Personal Income Tax -- Exemption for Federal Pension Benefits -- Refund</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The City of New York (City) and State of New York personal income tax scheme, which taxed Federal pension benefits received prior to January 1, 1989 (Tax Law &sect; 612 [c] [3-a]), while exempting State and local pension benefits from taxation (Federal pension benefits received on or after Jan. 1, 1989 now being exempt; Tax Law &sect; 612 [c] [3] [ii]; Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 11-1712 [c] [3]) is discriminatory, invalid and unconstitutional and the City and State defendants are therefore enjoined from assessing and collecting personal income taxes on Federal pensions received in the years 1986 through 1988, which may be still due and owing. Further, plaintiffs are entitled to a refund of that portion of their personal income taxes paid on Federal pension benefits for the years 1986 through 1988 provided that they file for a refund and meet all the procedural requirements for claiming a refund (Tax Law &sect; 687 [a]), since overpayments arising out of a tax later held to be unconstitutional are recoverable in the same manner as other overpayments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Rights -- Federal Civil Rights Claim -- Unlawful State Taxation of Federal Pension Benefits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiffs, who are seeking a tax refund for the State and New York City (City) income taxes they paid on Federal pension benefits for the years 1986 through 1988 pursuant to a discriminatory, unconstitutional tax scheme </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Tax Law &sect; 612 [c] [3] [ii]; Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 11-1712 [c] [3]), may not maintain a Federal civil rights action for damages (42 USC &sect; 1983) against the State or the State defendants in their official capacities.  Further, plaintiffs' claims under section 1983 against the State defendants in their individual capacities are not viable since there has been no showing that any of the State defendants personally engaged in any activity in connection with the taxation of Federal pensions sufficient to impose personal liability.  In addition, since the State took over the collection and administration of the City's personal income tax in 1975 and plaintiffs have failed to establish that the City and the City defendants engaged in any conduct concerning the enforcement of the challenged tax scheme, the section 1983 claims against the City and the City defendants in their official and individual capacities must likewise be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Tax Refund -- Injunctive Relief</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiffs' cause of action for injunctive relief against the further collection of the tax imposed on Federal pensions for the years prior to 1989 pursuant to a discriminatory, unconstitutional tax scheme has not been rendered moot because of the amendment of the tax scheme to exempt Federal pension benefits received after January 1, 1989 from taxation (Tax Law &sect; 612 [c] [3] [ii]; Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 11-1712 [c] [3]) since the tax scheme which taxes Federal pension benefits received prior to January 1, 1989 (Tax Law &sect; 612 [c] [3-a]) has not been annulled or repealed.  Accordingly, inasmuch as the tax scheme is unconstitutional and plaintiffs are entitled to seek a refund of taxes paid on Federal pension benefits from 1986 to 1988, reverse summary judgment granting injunctive relief is appropriate and the State defendants are, therefore, enjoined from assessing and collecting personal income taxes on Federal pension benefits which may be due and owing for the years 1986 through 1988 and are further enjoined from interfering with plaintiffs' right to file for a refund for personal income taxes paid on Federal benefits for those years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Money Received -- Refund of Unlawfully Collected Taxes -- Payment under Protest</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employees, who were designated by their state agencies as &quot;policy makers,&quot; were required to file disclosures of their personal finances and those of their spouses, pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act (Act), codified at N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 94, N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 73-a. The employees brought a N.Y.

Furthermore, employees aggrieved by being designated &quot;policy makers&quot; may seek redress within the internal workings of the agency in which they are employed and ultimately to the judicial system.  However, in order to assure the constitutionality of the statute, it must be interpreted so as to require that all adjudicative decisions and determinations made by the Commission or its Executive Director, including decisions and determinations upon applications for exemption or deletion from the requirements of financial disclosure, be accompanied by written findings of fact or by written statements of the reasons or the basis for such decisions or determinations </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 9 NYCRR 941.12).  Exemption and deletion procedures are necessary to vindicate the privacy rights of government employees subject to financial disclosure. Judicial review is an integral part of the due process required for those safety-valve procedures, and where access to judicial review is flawed or rendered ineffective by a failure of the Commission to make findings of fact or to state the factual bases for its determinations, this is tantamount to no judicial review and no due process. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorney filed an action for a declaratory judgment against defendant New York Ethics Commission that sought a declaration that the N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 73-a, which required financial disclosure from certain state officers and employees who earned over $ 30,000 a year, was unconstitutional and violated the United States and New York State Constitutions. The Ethics Commission moved for dismissal of the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney's department was designated as a policy maker, which required him to file financial disclosure reports. The court found that &sect; 73-a furthered a compelling state interest in deterring governmental corruption and in fostering public confidence in the system of government. The financial disclosure law's provision for disclosure manifested an acute sensitivity to the reporting individual's right of privacy and any claims of irrelevancy sought to be asserted. The law comported with due process requirement. The court found that the attorney's alleged infringement of his right of association was highly speculative because the law was not adopted with the intent to restrain freedom of association, and there was no showing of actual antagonism that resulted in loss of employment or public hostility. The court found that there were no equal protection infirmities with respect to &sect; 73-a because judicial officers and employees were not exempt from financial disclosure, and were covered under their own law. Thus, the classification of legislative and executive employees was not a suspect classification and rational basis scrutiny applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the attorney's motion for preliminary injunctive relief and granted summary judgment to New York Ethics Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Officers -- Ethics in Government Act -- Financial Disclosure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial disclosure requirements of the Ethics in Government Act requiring financial disclosure by certain high-salaried and all policy-making State employees, including information about their families ( Public Officers Law &sect; 73-a), are constitutional since the compelling State interest in discovering and deterring corruption and in promoting public confidence in government outweighs whatever constitutionally protected privacy interests that may be affected by the disclosure requirements.  The provisions of the Ethics in Government Act manifest an acute sensitivity to the reporting individual's right of privacy, and the statute's privacy mechanism ( Executive Law &sect; 94 [18] [h]) adequately protects the reporting individual's privacy interests and comports with the requirements of due process.  Those portions of the act which require covered employees to disclose certain business and organizational associations are not violative of the constitutional rights to freedom of association and freedom of speech since any adverse impact on those constitutionally protected rights is a tangential effect of legislation which promotes the State's compelling interest in encouraging the integrity of government and the public's confidence in government.  In addition, even if covered employees have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to their financial affairs, the statute's privacy mechanism adequately protects against unnecessary and unreasonable disclosure. Furthermore, the filing of an annual statement of financial disclosure does not violate the privilege against self-incrimination and compelled testimony.  Lastly, the fact that officers and employees of the judiciary are subject to disclosure requirements administered by the Chief Administrator of the Courts, rather than the Ethics Commission ( Judiciary Law &sect; 211 [4]), does not result in a denial of equal protection. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer sought to annul the final determination made by respondent Commissioner of Finance, which found it liable for a general corporation tax deficiency after the taxpayer did not include dividend income and capital gains income arising from its ownership and sale of corporate stock.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Michigan. It owned stock in a New Jersey corporation that was headquartered in New York City. Although both the taxpayer and the corporation did business in New York City, at no time did the two engage in any business activity between themselves in New York. The purchase and sale of the taxpayer's stock took place outside of New York and all dividend income was received outside the state. The Commissioner determined that the investment income received was subject to taxation by New York City and the court upheld that decision. It found that even if no unitary business relationship existed between the taxpayer and the corporation, the city could tax foreign investment income if it extended some protection to the activities that generated the income. In this case, the city only sought to tax the amount of the dividends and capital gains that were attributable to the corporation's business activities within the city. Further, it was undisputed that the city gave protection and benefits to the corporation's activities within its borders and that those activities gave rise to the income received by the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City of New York may properly tax the investment income of a corporation headquartered in Michigan and incorporated in Delaware where the income consisted of dividends and capital gains resulting from its ownership of stock in a corporation headquartered in New York and incorporated in New Jersey, and where both corporations did business in New York but at no time relevant to the instant proceeding did they engage in any business activity between themselves in New York, since a local government may constitutionally tax foreign investment income if that government has extended some protection to the activities which generate that income; although the United States Supreme Court has held that if an entity doing business within a given jurisdiction receives investment income from another entity having no connection with that jurisdiction, the jurisdiction may tax that income only if the two entities are engaged in a &quot;unitary business&quot;, the existence of a &quot;unitary business&quot; relationship is not the only method by which a local government may tax income from a foreign investment. The city has sought to tax the Michigan/Delaware corporation only on the amount of dividends and capital gains which it received and which are attributable to the New York/New Jersey corporation's business activities within the city, and it is undisputed that the city has given protection and benefits to the latter corporation's activities within its borders, activities which gave rise to the investment income in question.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, various interested parties, filed an action in the Supreme Court, Richmond County (New York) in opposition to certain actions by respondents, various municipal groups, and asked the court to prohibit any further action by the municipal groups in approving a site for future construction of the Staten Island Correctional Facility (the project).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The interested parties hoped to prevent the municipal groups from taking any further action toward the selection and acquisition of a certain site approved by the New York City Board of Estimate for future construction of the project and hoped to restrain the municipal groups from taking further action for the development and construction of the project until compliance, as perceived by the interested parties, with various environmental laws was accomplished. A claim was asserted that the New York City Board of Estimate (BOE) had no legal authority to approve the project, but the court found otherwise. Similarly, the interested parties claimed the BOE acted improperly when it designated the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Department of City Planning (DCP) as lead agencies for purposes of preparing an environmental impact statement (EIS). The court found, however, that the BOE made the final determinations at to the EIS, and state law did not prevent the BOE from relying upon information or advice received from others, including consultants or other agencies, provided that the reliance was reasonable under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The interested parties' petition was denied in all respects because the BOE acted with proper authority and was able to rely on advice given by other agencies so long as such reliance was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- New York City Board of Estimate -- Authority to Approve Construction of Prison</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Notwithstanding the holding of the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Board of Estimate v Morris</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (489 U.S. --, 109 S Ct 1433) that the structure of the New York City Board of Estimate is unconstitutional as violative of the &quot;one person, one vote&quot; principle, the Board had proper authority to pass upon the application for approval of the construction of a prison, since it is improbable that the Federal courts intended that the City of New York suddenly function without a governing body authorized to exercise important governmental functions such as land use decisions, contract and franchise approval, zoning changes, and budget recommendations; the statement of the Federal court, &quot;In the meantime, though flawed, the Board of Estimate may continue to function.  Six months should be a target area, one year a deadline&quot; (831 F2d 393), is merely an exhortation to prompt curative action and not an injunction staying the Board from governing after a certain date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental Conservation -- Environmental Quality Review -- Lead Agency</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding to prevent the construction of a prison in New York City, it was not improper for the New York City Departments of Environmental Protection and City Planning to act as &quot;lead agencies&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, ECL 8-0111 [6]) for the implementation of the environmental quality review procedures set forth in the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) (ECL art 8), where the New York City Board of Estimate, by approving the construction, made the final determination that an environmental impact statement (EIS) was required and had the final EIS before it for review and consideration; the New York City Department of Correction caused a consultant to prepare a draft EIS under the technical supervision of the aforementioned &quot;lead agencies&quot;, and there was nothing wrong with the use by the Board of the &quot;lead agencies&quot; as investigative arms, since those agencies had the technical expertise necessary to prepare a draft and final EIS.  The Board held a public hearing at which petitioners gave testimony, and the Board had a right to rely on the EIS prepared by the &quot;lead agencies&quot; so long as it reserved the final authority on approval or disapproval of the construction.  Accordingly, the letter and spirit of SEQRA were satisfied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental Conservation -- Environmental Quality Review -- Consideration of Alternatives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a proceeding to prevent the construction of a prison in New York City, the record adequately demonstrates that during the site selection process 23 other sites were considered and evaluated by respondents; every possible alternative need not be discussed in an environmental impact statement (EIS), which must be &quot;analytical&quot; but need not be &quot;encyclopedic&quot;.  Moreover, petitioners can point to no rule of law, statute, or regulation requiring the municipal respondents to reopen the site selection process when a determination was made to reduce the size of the prison; respondents took the requisite &quot;hard look&quot; at the alternatives during the site selection process and reevaluated them again when the determination to reduce the size of the project was made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental Conservation -- Environmental Quality Review -- Consideration of Socio-Economic Impact of Project on Community -- Construction of Prison</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a proceeding to prevent the construction of a prison in New York City, the final environmental impact statement (EIS) did not fail to adequately consider the socio-economic impact of the prison on the community, where it contained a demographic profile of the surrounding neighborhood and detailed statistics about the population; though reasonable persons may differ as to the conclusions to be reached from the data contained in the final EIS, reasonable doubts should be resolved in favor of administrative findings.  Similarly, the EIS reviewed and discussed the environmental impacts with respect to the ecology, traffic, prison demographics, and available medical care for the construction project, and incorporated as conditions mitigative measures that were identified as practicable to minimize or avoid any adverse environmental impacts.  The data contained in the EIS and the mitigative measures proposed provide a rational basis to support the determination of the New York City Board of Estimate to go ahead with the project, notwithstanding that other data might be available to support other conclusions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental Conservation -- Environmental Quality Review -- Construction of Prison -- Waterfront Act</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a proceeding to prevent the construction of a prison in New York City, none of the actions taken by the municipal respondents violate the letter and spirit of either the Waterfront Act (Executive Law art 42) or the New York City Waterfront Revitalization Program; the City Planning Commission, in its capacity as the City Coastal Commission, reviewed the proposed project and found it consistent with the policies of the program, and the waterfront revitalization statutes do not require only water-dependent activities within designated waterfront areas.  Although reasonable persons may argue that the proposed project may be better suited elsewhere, it is not the role of the court to weigh the desirability of the action or to choose among alternatives, since the court's authority is limited to determining whether the law has been complied with by the municipal respondents; accordingly, inasmuch as the approval by the New York City Board of Estimate was not arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion, the petition is denied.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowner filed an application for a certificate of appropriateness required for a demolition permit. Respondent commission passed a resolution that denied the application. On review, respondent board of appeals issued a decision affirming the commission's resolution. In response, the landowner filed an action, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, seeking review of the commission's resolution and the board of appeals' decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner possessed a building within the historic district which was subject to the jurisdiction of the commission. The building had become seriously deteriorated as well as structurally unsound. The ravages of time were further compounded by a major fire. Following the fire, the local building commissioner directed the landowner to barricade the premises, stabilize the building, and secure a building permit for restoration of the premises. Consequently, the landowner filed an amended application for a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of the premises. In its resolution denying the application, the commission in part held it did not have jurisdiction or authority to issue such a certificate unless the landowner submitted and obtained design approval for new development in accordance with Albany, N.Y., Historic Resources Commission Ordinance &sect; 1-135(b)(2). The board of appeals upheld the resolution. On review, the court determined setting aside the resolution and the affirmance was appropriate because those decisions were arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Other than imposing the obligation of maintenance upon a landowner, government does not have the right to impose upon him the sole burden of an economically unfeasible restoration for the general benefit of society-at-large </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">FGL &amp; L Prop.

If the historic value of petitioner's property outweighs the economic cost of historic restoration, and society desires to preserve that historic value, then society, embodied in its government, must condemn the property and bear the burden of the historic preservation. Accordingly, the matter is remanded to the Commission with the mandate that a &quot;certificate of appropriateness&quot; for demolition be granted, upon any reasonable conditions requiring preservation and retention of any artifacts, moldings, and other building materials of significant historic value that can be used in connection with any future new construction at the site. </SPAN></P>

Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.20, alleging that it was invalid as a matter of law because it constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 and U. S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant discovered that he had AIDS in an advanced stage shortly after beginning a prison sentence as the result of a negotiated plea agreement under which he was sentenced to an indefinite prison term of at least two years but no more then four for felony possession and sale of drugs. Defendant sought a motion to set aside his sentence pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.20, alleging that in light of his condition, the sentence was invalid as a matter of law because it constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 and U. S. Const. amend. XIII. The court denied defendant's motion, ruling that although defendant's incarceration was unfortunate under his present condition, applying a subjective standard, the court could not find as a matter of law, that his incarceration was so inhuman as to shock the court's conscience because he was receiving proper care and treatment in the prison hospital. The court concluded that it joined in the recommendation that defendant be admitted to a facility devoted to the care of AIDS victims under a special release program.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's motion to set aside his sentence is denied.  It was discovered during defendant's incarceration that he is afflicted with AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), that the disease is in an advanced stage and that his life expectancy is from 12 to 18 months.  Defendant argues that his otherwise authorized sentence, an indeterminate term of imprisonment imposed in a narcotics prosecution pursuant to a negotiated plea arrangement, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of constitutional proscriptions inasmuch as the imposition of the sentence renders it one of life imprisonment given his dire medical condition. Defendant received the minimum allowable statutory sentence; in any event, using an objective standard, severe punishment of drug offenders has not been considered irrationally harsh.  Under a subjective analysis, it cannot be said that defendant's incarceration is subhuman so as to shock the court's conscience; defendant is hospitalized and is receiving necessary and appropriate medical care. A defendant's affliction with AIDS, in and of itself, is not an extraordinary circumstance which warrants interference with a sentence imposed within statutory guidelines. Any application to ameliorate the conditions of incarceration should be made to the Department of Correctional Services; the interests of justice would be served by allowing defendant to live out his life in a facility devoted to the care of AIDS victims, and the court recommends that defendant be a benefactor of the Compassionate Release Program.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The people contended that defendant beat and raped his child's babysitter, then told her that he had AIDS. The people requested a blood sample from defendant as non-testimonial evidence to determine whether he could be identified or excluded as the rapist, and whether he in fact had AIDS in order for the rape kit to be safely tested. The court granted the people's application. The people met their burden by establishing the probable cause to believe that defendant had committed the crime, and that the methods they intended to use to secure the blood samples would be safe and reliable. Additionally, the victim had the right to know whether she was exposed to the AIDS virus by reason of having been exposed to the body and sexual fluids of defendant. The taking of blood was not prohibited by N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2781 because he placed into controversy the issue of his physical condition with respect to having AIDS. N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3121.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Disclosure -- Compelling Defendant who Claims He Has AIDS to Provide Blood Samples in Rape Prosecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a prosecution of defendant for rape and other offenses, the People's motion for an order pursuant to CPL 240.40 (2) (b) (v) requiring the defendant to provide blood samples as nontestimonial evidence is granted.  The defendant told the complainant that he had AIDS, and although a Vitullo rape kit was taken from the complainant, the police laboratory would not, as a matter of policy, perform an analysis.  The People seek the blood samples to determine whether defendant can be identified or excluded as the perpetrator, and to determine if the defendant has AIDS, in order for the Vitullo kit to be safely analyzed. There is a showing of probable cause that defendant committed the crimes alleged in the indictment, the People have particularized the nature of what they are seeking and the person from whom the blood samples are to be taken, and there is no less intrusive means of obtaining the needed evidence.  The People have a sampling of the perpetrator's semen that will not be tested by the police laboratory if the perpetrator had AIDS, and a necessary requirement for allowing the taking of a blood sample is the possession of a viable sample with comparative value.  The testing of a Vitullo kit has become a necessary element in the immediate investigation of alleged sexual crimes; where, as here, a defendant announces that he has AIDS, he cannot claim that his constitutional rights would be violated by the taking of a blood sample in order to prevent any further investigation and possible prosecution of the assailant. Further, the victim has a right to know whether she may have been exposed to the AIDS virus.  The People should not be prevented from obtaining what ordinarily would be an appropriate and constitutionally recognized request for nontestimonial evidence.  Defendant's argument that the taking of such a test would be prohibited by Public Health Law &sect; 2781 is without merit.  </SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 19-105 because it did not post warning signs when it excavated public roads. The utility filed a motion to dismiss that argued &sect; 19-105 was void for vagueness because: the Department of Transportation had not published the required form for the signs; and, &quot;obstruction&quot; and &quot;unsafe condition&quot; were not defined in the code section.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility corporation was criminally charged with not posting warning signs as required by New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 19-105 whenever it excavated public roads. In its motion to dismiss, the utility argued that &sect; 19-105 was void for vagueness for two reasons. First, the Department of Transportation had not published the required form for the warning signs and, second, the terms &quot;obstruction&quot; and &quot;unsafe condition&quot; were not defined in the code section. The court held that the acceptable form for the warning notices had been published in the New York City Department of Transportation Highway Regulations, which incorporated by reference therein the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, a publication of the United States Department of Transportation Federal Highways Administration. In addition, the court found that the terms &quot;unsafe condition&quot; and &quot;obstruction&quot; like the terms &quot;intoxicated&quot; and &quot;impaired&quot; had commonly understood meanings sufficient to give the utility adequate notice as to what was required under the code section. Holding that the code section did not have to define common terms, the court denied the utility's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, section 2.0.17 of the New York City Department of Transportation Highway Regulations, and the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, referred to in the regulation, provide the public with notice of the type and form of signs that must be posted when excavation work is done.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that under the clear language of the statutes governing adoption, together with the policy of the state as articulated in case law, the contract provided for the sale of a child, or, at the very least, the sale of a mother's right to her child in contravention of the law of the state. The surrogacy contract, therefore, was void. Accordingly, only if the mother would have sworn under oath before the court that she had not and would not request, accept or receive the money promised to her in exchange for surrender of her child, thus assuring the court that such surrender was truly voluntary and was motivated by her concern for the best interests of her child and not the promise of financial gain, could the court have accepted such surrender and terminated her parental rights. In addition, consistent with N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 374(6), the proposed adoptive parents must have also provided sworn affidavits evidencing their intent not to pay or give any compensation or thing of value to any party in exchange for the child.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, only if the surrogate mother swears under oath before the court that she will not receive the $ 10,000 promised to her in exchange for surrender of her child can the court accept such surrender and terminate her parental rights. </SPAN></P>

Respondents have made no commitment to undertake to correct the conditions at the premises, and they offered no proof that they could not do so; respondents apparently would simply like the premises turned over to them free of any imposition to comply with a court order to correct, obtained prior to the tenants initiating the instant proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

There being only legal issues to address, and no factual issues, the court will proceed to render a determination on the merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- Tobacco Smoking -- Regulation of Smoking Indoors -- Health Hazard to Nonsmokers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an action challenging the constitutionality of Laws of 1989 (ch 244), which established a comprehensive plan regulating tobacco smoking in public areas </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Public Health Law art 13-E), the weight of scientific evidence has shown that secondhand smoke, i.e., that which is not inhaled, represents a significant health hazard to nonsmokers. Accordingly, it is reasonable to conclude that Laws of 1989 (ch 244) is an appropriate response by the Legislature to the need to protect the citizens of the State from involuntary exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Moreover, even if the scientific evidence demonstrating the deleterious effect of secondhand smoke were not so overwhelming as it is, it would not be the prerogative of the court to contest the wisdom of the Legislature in choosing what evidence to credit since there is a presumption that the Legislature investigated and found facts necessary to support the legislation; petitioners have failed to show that the facts on which the Legislature relied are not only erroneous, but that the issue is not even truly debatable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- Tobacco Smoking -- Regulation of Smoking Indoors -- Police Power of State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In an action challenging the constitutionality of Laws of 1989 (ch 244), which established a comprehensive plan regulating tobacco smoking in public areas </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Public Health Law art 13-E), petitioners' contentions alleging a &quot;right of liberty and privacy&quot; to smoke are without merit; the statute is a recognition by the Legislature of the medical harm inflicted upon nonsmokers by involuntary exposure to secondhand smoke in indoor areas open to the public, food service establishments and places of employment.  Where smoking may be permitted and under what circumstances, along with what is a satisfactory provision of nonsmoking areas, reflect a well-modulated, carefully considered balancing of interest so as to best protect the public without unduly burdening private individuals or businesses.  Regulation of smoking is a valid use of the State's police power since there is no more a fundamental right to smoke cigarettes than there is to ingest illegal drugs or run a red light; it is within the province of a State to say how far cigarettes may be sold or to prohibit their sale entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- Tobacco Smoking -- Regulation of Smoking Indoors -- Restriction of Access of Smokers to Public Places</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Laws of 1989 (ch 244), which established a comprehensive plan regulating tobacco smoking in public areas </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Public Health Law art 13-E), does not restrict the access of smokers to public places, only their right to smoke therein; the statute pertains only to activity of a public dimension and does not apply to significantly private areas, such as private homes, residences, automobiles, hotel or motel rooms or to private events, such as private social functions where the seating arrangements are under the control of the sponsor of the function.  The use of considerations of spatial dimensions and proximity of smokers to nonsmokers in certain instances, and complete prohibition of smoking in others, represent an accommodation between the desire to limit the exposure of nonsmokers to tobacco smoke and relevant economic and social considerations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- Tobacco Smoking -- Regulation of Smoking Indoors -- Right of Privacy to Smoke</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. If a general &quot;right of privacy&quot; to smoke tobacco exists, Laws of 1989 (ch 244), which established a comprehensive plan regulating tobacco smoking in public areas </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Public Health Law art 13-E), merely requires smokers to exercise it outdoors or in private; there is no differentiation between classes of citizens by the statute, and those who smoke have never in law been recognized as a distinct class.  Under the statute, no person loses any recognizable right or liberty by virtue of being a smoker; it is not a blanket prohibition against smoking, merely a limitation of smoking in public areas where other persons will involuntarily be exposed to secondhand smoke. The statute is no different from any other law by which conduct, permissible in private, is regulated in public for health reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- Tobacco Smoking -- Regulation of Smoking Indoors -- Permissible Classification</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The classification of smokers and nonsmokers created by Laws of 1989 (ch 244), which established a comprehensive plan regulating tobacco smoking in public areas </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Public Health Law art 13-E), is rationally related to the legislative objective of protecting the health of nonsmokers since there is no other possible manner of regulating the activity involved than to distinguish smokers from nonsmokers. Inasmuch as the statute does not create or apply to a &quot;suspect&quot; class or affect a &quot;fundamental right&quot;, it is not subject to strict judicial scrutiny, but rather to the rational basis standard of review applicable to due process claims; the Equal Protection Clause does not prevent State Legislatures from drawing lines that treat one class of individuals or entities differently from others, unless the difference in treatment is palpably arbitrary or amounts to an invidious discrimination.  Petitioners' constitutional arguments concern the wisdom of the legislation, rather than its rationality, and courts do not sit in review of the wisdom of the acts of a Legislature; the fact that the means employed by the Legislature imposes inconvenience or hardship is a plea to be addressed to the ballot box or the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- Tobacco Smoking -- Regulation of Smoking Indoors -- Delegation of Police Power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Laws of 1989 (ch 244), which established a comprehensive plan regulating tobacco smoking in public areas </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Public Health Law art 13-E), does not unconstitutionally delegate police power and does not utilize vague definitions; authorizing the owner or operator of an indoor area to entirely prohibit smoking in that area effects no change from the common-law right of an owner of private property to curtail smoking on his premises.  The statute does not confer substantive rule-making authority on any State agency or municipality since the Commissioner of Health is expressly precluded from promulgating substantive regulations </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Public Health Law &sect; 1399-x), and no delegation of rule-making authority is conferred on municipalities, only the specific expression of the Legislature that the statute was not intended to preempt local governments from acting in an area (public health) in which they have long been authorized to act </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">(see, e.g.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> , Public Health Law &sect; 347).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officer sought review of a conviction of the Auburn City Court (New York), which found the police officer guilty of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. &sect; 1129(a) relative to following another vehicle to closely. The police officer had rear ended another car while answering an emergency call, and the state prosecuted him for the violation of &sect; 1129(a) as a result of the accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer contended on appeal that &sect; 1129(a) was unconstitutional, that the trial court erred as a matter of law in failing to apply the proper standard of proof of conviction, and that the trial court failed to consider the police officer's vehicle as an emergency vehicle. The court found that &sect; 1129(a) was constitutional as prior case law had already examined the statute and determined the same to have been sufficiently definite to be constitutional. The court also found that since the legislature did not make &sect; 1129(a) all encompassing as to speed, traffic, and highway conditions to be considered in determining when a vehicle follows to closely, the trial court's finding of guilt based solely upon the failure to anticipate a driver's reaction to a traffic device was erroneous. As a result, the court reversed the judgment of conviction charging defendant with the violation of &sect; 1129(a). Further, the court found that the prosecutor failed to disprove the emergency vehicle theory and the record clearly stated that the police officer was operating a police vehicle and following a possible violator.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Following Too Closely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 1129 (a) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law which provides that the &quot;driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent having due regard for the speed of such vehicle and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway&quot; is constitutional.  However, the conviction of defendant, a police officer who had a rear-end collision with the vehicle he was following in his police cruiser, must be reversed since the conviction was improperly based solely upon defendant's failure to anticipate the sudden stop of the other vehicle for the amber traffic light. The proper standard is that a motorist would be guilty of following too closely if, in view of the speed of the vehicles, traffic upon or condition of the highways reasonably to be anticipated, he is guilty of ordinary negligence with respect to following too closely alone.  In addition, the failure of the prosecutor to disprove defendant's emergency vehicle theory (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect;&sect; 114-b, 1104) warrants a reversal of the conviction and the dismissal of the information.  </SPAN></P>
