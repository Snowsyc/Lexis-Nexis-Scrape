The court of appeals reversed the conviction and held that the statute was unconstitutional. At the request of the State, a writ of certiorari was issued to the New Mexico Court of Appeals. The court reversed the opinion of the Court of Appeals insofar as it held to be unconstitutional N. M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-9-6 (1972), which was the sodomy statute in effect at the time of the crime but which had since been repealed and replaced by N. M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-9-21 (Supp.1975). The court noted that the Court of Appeals based its holding on the ground that the statute embraced and proscribed sodomitic conduct on the part of the consenting adults, contrary to the rights guaranteed to them under the United States Constitution. In light of United States Supreme Court decisions on the subject, the New Mexico sodomy statute was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed a motion requesting the State to identify and produce a confidential informant who was a witness along with a police officer in the sale of narcotics, which formed the basis for the prosecution of defendants. The trial judge held an in camera hearing and denied the disclosure. Defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for new considerations. A second trial judge held an in camera hearing and denied the disclosure. The Court of Appeals reversed and ordered disclosure. The court disagreed and noted that two trial judges held separate in camera hearings. Both concluded that, based upon the particular circumstances of this case, the state should not have been required to disclose the informer's identity, since his testimony would not be relevant and helpful to the defense of the accused, or necessary to a fair determination of the issue of their guilt or innocence. The court noted that it had reviewed the record, including the transcript of the second in camera proceeding and concluded that the trial court was correct and clearly did not abuse its discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant individuals challenged the decision of the district court (New Mexico), which denied the individual's motion to alter or amend a judgment discharging a writ of prohibition, that prohibited respondent judge from hearing the cases charging the individuals with violating municipal codes prohibiting disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, assault, and battery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals contended that allowing non-attorney court judges to preside over criminal cases arising from violations of municipal ordinances which were punishable by incarceration violated rights guaranteed by the state constitution to defendants in these proceedings. The court rejected the individuals' contentions that all non-attorney judges inherently could not have been fair and impartial. The court reasoned that fairness was not so inextricably tied to the education of an attorney that without such an education a municipal court judge could not have been fair. The court further rejected the individuals' contention that a statutory scheme, which allowed defendants in two municipalities to have been tried before an attorney judge but allows defendants in other municipalities to have been tried before non-attorney judges, denied them the equal protection of the law under the state and federal constitutions. The court held that beyond merely asserting this argument, the individuals failed to show that they were correct in concluding that an equal protection problem arose when municipalities, pursuant to powers given to them by the legislature, enacted different ordinances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Bureau of Revenue of the State of New Mexico, petitioned for a writ of certiorari to challenge a two-to-one decision of the Court of Appeals (New Mexico) in favor of appellant taxpayer in the taxpayer's appeal from the Bureau's denial of her request for a refund of taxes paid to the State of New Mexico on gross receipts derived from the transmission of interstate telegraphic messages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a telegraph company agent who transmitted interstate and intrastate messages. She was paid a set rate per message or money order sent or received. She filed an informal protest of a denial of her claim for a refund of taxes assessed against her, and the Bureau denied the request. Two judges of the intermediate appellate court held that her income fell within the definition of &quot;gross receipts&quot; in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-16A-3(F) (Supp.1975), but one of those judges and the third judge denied the applicability of the deduction in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-16A-14.10 (Supp.1975) for receipts from transactions in interstate commerce. The court reversed the Bureau's order and decision. The language of &sect; 72-16A-14.10 was clear and unambiguous, and it applied to the taxpayer insofar as she transmitted interstate messages. The court held that the taxpayer's activities constituted interstate commerce when she sent messages bound for another state because interstate messages, once transmitted, were part of a national communications network. The taxpayer was therefore allowed to deduct from her gross receipts amounts she obtained from messages bound for points outside New Mexico.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the Bureau's order and decision. The case was returned to the Bureau for the purpose of defining the percentages of the taxpayer's gross receipts derived from interstate and intrastate commerce and levying the tax on the intrastate portion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the District Court of the Eighth Judicial District in Colfax County (New Mexico), entered after a jury trial, that convicted him of first degree murder and sentenced him to death. Defendant's motion for severance of his trial from that of a co-defendant was granted, as was his motion for a change of venue from another county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony murder after a service station robbery. The court reversed the judgment. The exclusion of three veniremen because of their opposition to the death penalty did not violate defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI, XIV or deprive him of his right to an impartial jury. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-29-2 (Supp. 1973), requiring a death sentence for conviction of a capital felony, did not violate N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18. The legislature was presumed to know that first degree murder was the only offense to which it applied. The title of the bill that enacted &sect; 40A-29-2 did not violate N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16, and the reference in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-2-(A)(3) to &quot;any felony&quot; gave sufficient notice of the statute's true import to satisfy N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18. No showing was made that defendant's counsel did not use a normal and customary degree of skill. Reversal was required because the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could find defendant guilty of first degree murder if it found that he committed any kind of willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing. No such charges were made in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

The residents also sought a declaratory judgment that the school district could not construct or improve buildings on reservation lands. The trial court found against the residents. On appeal, the court affirmed. The reservation residents were properly included in the election. N.M. Const. art. IX, &sect; 11, restricting the right to vote in school district bond elections to real estate owners and those who paid a property tax on property in the school district, violated the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution.Navajo tribal self-government and federal rights did not conflict with the State's operation and exclusive control of schools on reservation lands leased by the school district.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff passenger brought a negligence action against defendant driver. The Court of Appeals (New Mexico) affirmed the decision of the district court, which granted the driver's motion to dismiss the passenger's action on the ground that the facts as stated in the complaint fell within the terms of New Mexico's &quot;guest statute,&quot; N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passenger claimed that she was injured while a guest in the driver's car, alleging that he failed to use due and ordinary care while operating his vehicle. The driver replied that the New Mexico guest statute barred the passenger's complaint. In turn, the passenger attacked the constitutionality of the guest statute as violative of N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, in that it arbitrarily and unreasonably discriminated between paying and nonpaying guests. Agreeing with the driver, the district court dismissed the passenger's complaint. The court of appeals affirmed. The passenger sought certiorari review. The court held that the guest statute was void because it denied equal protection of the law. Applying rational basis review, the court reasoned that the classification imposed by the guest statute was unreasonable, arbitrary, and did not rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to either of the objects of the legislation. In sum, the classifications did not bear a substantial and rational relation to the statute's purposes of protecting the hospitality of the host driver and preventing collusive lawsuits.</SPAN></P>

Appellants had standing to seek review of the supervisor's order as parties &quot;aggrieved and directly affected&quot; by the order under &sect; 48-15-133. Appellants asserted they would suffer from undue competitive injury if another branch was permitted in Santa Fe because there was not sufficient business and demand to assure and maintain the solvency of existing associations. They also asserted that another branch would not be to the advantage of the community. The protection of such interests was explicitly recognized in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-15-61(A).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in municipal court with violating a city ordinance that required the operator of a motorcycle to wear a safety helmet meeting standards specified by the motor vehicle department (DMV). The municipal court held the ordinance to be unconstitutional and the district court affirmed. On appeal by the municipality, the court reversed, explaining that the subject matter of the ordinance did not lie beyond the reach of the municipality's police power in that a rational basis for the ordinance was easily discernible. Not only would the measure protect the life and limb of the citizenry, but it would keep citizens out of hospitals and off the relief rolls. The court observed that ordinances, like statutes, were presumed to be valid and that defendant failed to sustain his burden of establishing its invalidity. Moreover, the ordinance's delegation to the DMV of the power to determine what type of helmet should be worn did not deprive defendant of due process, as delegated standards needed not be specific as long as they were capable of reasonable understanding. The court noted that the testing methods for arriving at the DMV standards had not been challenged.</SPAN></P>

The councilman then ran for office and was elected to the position of councilman.

On review, the court found that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5-4-42(B) provided that no person in the personnel office could hold political office during his or her employment. Furthermore, the court found that the position of councilman was a political office. The court reasoned that the councilman ran as a member of an organized slate of candidates who adopted a name and a platform, solicited funds to support the election of the slate, and advertised as a slate. Furthermore, it was the councilman's burden to show that persons similarly situated were treated differently in an impermissible manner, which he failed to do.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A land grant gave to 20 families a certain tract of land, including the land upon which a town was located. The grant was confirmed by the United States Congress and patented by the United States to the town in 1909. The lands had been deeded to the state to satisfy delinquent taxes. Quitclaim deeds were executed by which all grant lands were conveyed to the association. One of the deeds was executed by the town as grantor through its board of trustees. The deed was executed after the effective date of 1943 N.M. Laws ch. 47, &sect; 67. The other deed was executed by many of the residents of the town. The association paid the taxes and redeemed the land. The residents filed an action in which they sought, among other things, injunctive relief and a determination of the heirs to the land grant. The lower court granted a judgment in favor of the association. On review, it was alleged that the residents were vested with property and participatory rights in the common lands of the grant by the 1909 patent. The court affirmed. The court held that based on previous case law no property interest in the common lands were conveyed to the individual residents of the grant by the 1909 patent.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled against the candidate and he appealed the ruling. The court held that the requirements that a candidate obtain a number of signatures before being placed on the ballot was not a denial of due process because the State had a legitimate interest in regulating the size of the ballot so as to minimize voter confusion and to prevent the overwhelming of voting machines. The court also determined that the requirement of obtaining signatures was not unreasonable or obtrusive. Further, the court stated that the legislation would not be deemed unconstitutional under N.M. Const. art. 4, &sect; 5 on the grounds that the legislature was not authorized to pass the law because that argument could only be made prospectively from the date of this decision.</SPAN></P>

The trial court declared that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46-10-14.1(D) of the Act was unconstitutional because the title to that Act did not include local option elections and was not broad enough to give notice of the subject matter actually contained in &sect; 46-10-14.1(D), as required by N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16. On appeal, the court held that examination of the title of the Act led to the conclusion that the title was a restrictive one and limited the broad subject of alcoholic liquors. The title was restrictive in nature, the matter of local option district elections could not be considered germane to the subject matter expressed in the title. There was nothing contained in the title that could alert the reader that elections were contemplated. The court held that local option district elections did not have a logical and natural connection with the hours and days of business for the sale of alcoholic beverages.</SPAN></P>

The court held invalid the vetoes involving the three contingent appropriations because they would have affirmatively appropriated the sums involved without conditions.

The court upheld the veto of certain language from the higher education category that did not alter or effect the remaining portions of that part of House Bill 300, but invalidated the governor's remaining vetoes because they conditionally appropriated additional funds to the state agencies not included in the ten categories.

Before that announcement he had no reason to intervene, as his interests were protected. The municipal judge did not waive his right to intervene. The court reversed the judgment commanding the municipality's governing body and its members to conduct a recall election because it was fairly implied from N.M. Const. art.

Ann. &sect; 14-47-9.1, which provided for the payment by municipalities of the expense of relocation of facilities in urban renewal projects, was not applicable because the statute explicitly did not apply to existing urban renewal projects. Since the urban renewal project had been fully approved prior to the effective date of the statute, even though there were subsequent amendments to the project, that statute was ineffective. The court, after finding that there were no misrepresentations or concealments, held that the defense of estoppel was inapplicable. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bus owner claimed the school district and school board made oral representations that his contract to provide service would be renewed; however, after he and others filed an election contest, he was told his contract would not be renewed. The letter sent to the bus owner by the school board stated that the bus owner's legal actions against the school board constituted cause for nonrenewal. The bus owner brought suit against defendants, claiming their actions were unreasonable and constituted a deprivation of his rights of free speech and association. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss and the court reversed. It found that although there was no actual contract involved, that alone did not defeat the bus owner's claim that the nonrenewal of his contract violated his rights to free speech and association. Further, the bus owner's participation in a lawsuit against the school board was a constitutionally protected right that fell under the rights covered by 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. As to defendants' liability, the court determined that the application of the doctrine of qualified immunity was appropriate if the was a showing of good faith on their part.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held individual members of the state bar that intervened were not proper parties to the appeal as they failed to comply with N.M.

David Norvell, Attorney General. The court found the credit bureau was licensed under the Collection Agency Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 67-15-22 to 67-1-89 (1953), letters were sent to debtors by employees who were not lawyers, the debtors were then sued by the credit bureau as the creditors rights were assigned to the credit bureau, and the credit bureau controlled the entire litigation in the magistrate court. The record also proved the credit bureau's collection manager appeared at trial to litigate the case but if an attorney appeared for a debtor an attorney litigated the case. The court affirmed the grant of injunctive relief prohibiting the credit bureau from the unauthorized practice of law under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18-1-26 (1953).

The court of appeals reversed the judgment, finding that the statute was constitutionally inadequate because the statute's title failed to mention the subject matter of sovereign immunity. The court granted certiorari and held that the statute did not create absolute sovereign immunity but merely restated or expanded upon existing common law immunity. The court found that by the literal terms of N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16, sovereign immunity was not the subject of the statute but was only incidentally at issue.

The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the trial court correctly determined that the partial final decree was somewhat ambiguous as to the duty of water and correctly proceeded to receive evidence in connection therewith as the parties were previously denied the opportunity to do so. The court also found there was substantial evidence to support the trial court's finding that the duty of water should properly be set at three-acre feet. Further, the order limiting the duty of water was not a denial of due process or the taking of property without just compensation as the trial court considered all of the matters in the record before it, including the conflicting evidence as to the annual duty of water and as to the amount of carriage losses, and the record indicated an exhaustive presentation of evidence directed to all the issues involved.</SPAN></P>

It was a valid and reasonable exercise of the state's police power. Nor did the Law deny equal protection. It affected all persons licensed to operate motor vehicles. It was reasonable to make a separate classification for those who refused to submit to the test and it was not unreasonable that harsher treatment was given to those who refused to submit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence indicated that defendant stopped a young girl, forced himself into her pickup, and forced her to drive him into the country. He then raped her and attempted to strangle her. To support his motion that he could not get a fair trial in the county, he submitted five newspaper articles. The court held that the trial court's findings that he could received a fair trial in the county was supported by the evidence and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying his change of venue motion. Evidence from two female witnesses that an individual in a vehicle similar to defendant's had attempted to force them to stop in a manner used by the offender was admissible to prove the identity of defendant as the person who committed the crime. The court held that the trial court did not commit error in holding that the in-court identification of defendant by the victim was not tainted by the police showing photographs of defendant to the victim when she was in the hospital. Her identification of defendant was positive, and nothing suggested any dependence on the earlier identification of his photographs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed a judgment from the District Court of Quay County (New Mexico), which convicted him of first-degree murder. On the State's motion, defendant was certified as an adult under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-8-27 (1953) and was tried as such. At issue, inter alia, was the application of N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18 and art. IV, &sect; 16, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40(A)-2-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim died as the result of a blow on the head and face with a blunt instrument. Defendant was seen at the victim's home shortly before the crime was discovered. He had armed himself with a rock before entering her apartment, and he admitted to striking the victim with the rock and that he had taken a gun and cash from the apartment. On appeal, the court ruled, inter alia, that (1) prior court precedent established, contrary to defendant's contention, that the procedure in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-8-27 for certifying juveniles as adults did not violate N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18 or U.S. Const. amend. XIV; (2) 1959 N.M. Laws 361 (Act), the enabling legislation for N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-8-27, gave adequate notice that provisions for certification of a juvenile reasonably could have been found within the Act, for purposes of N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16; (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion for change on venue; and (4) the facts and circumstances of the case unerringly established defendant's guilt of first-degree murder beyond any reasonable doubt, and thus substantial evidence supported his conviction under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A-2-1(3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State Highway Commission of New Mexico sought review of the decision from the District Court of Torrance County (New Mexico), which awarded damages to appellee landowner in the State's eminent domain action condemning the landowner's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State instituted condemnation proceedings against the landowner. The jury awarded the landowner damages for the partial taking. On appeal, the State claimed that the trial court erroneously adopted for the measure of damages, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-9-9.1 (1953), 1968 N.M. Laws 30.1, approved and effective as of February 19, 1968, because the law was not yet in effect on the &quot;date of taking,&quot; purportedly February 9, 1968. The court found that clearly and logically the &quot;date of taking&quot; was the date on which the condemnor became vested with the legal right to possession, dominion, and control over the real estate being condemned. This date was March 5, 1968, the date of the order making the preliminary order of entry permanent. Thus the court held that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-9-9.1 (1953) correctly stated the measure of damages applicable to the partial taking and was in effect on the date of taking. The court also found that the statute did not amend, alter, or modify other statutes during the pendency of a case in violation of N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 34; rather, it merely codified the correct and existing rule or measure of damages in cases of a partial taking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent magistrates appealed the judgment of the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico) which granted petitioner, an individual, his request for an alternative writ of mandamus and declared the replevin statute, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 36-13-1 through 36-13-6 unconstitutional and enjoined the magistrates from enforcing the replevin statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner challenged the magistrates' authority to allow the opposing party to replevy goods in the petitioner's possession upon posting a bond and filing an affidavit. Only if the petitioner posted a similar bond, would he be entitled to keep the goods until a hearing was held on the other party's claim. Thus, the petitioner could be deprived of the goods without notice and an opportunity to be heard, even if he had a good defense to the replevin action, and if he did not or could not post the required bond. On appeal, the court rejected the magistrates' assertion that mandamus could not be used to question the constitutionality of the replevin statute. The court found that the petitioner did not have an adequate remedy at law or by appeal. The court affirmed the trial court's determination that the New Mexico replevin statute, in so far as it provided for a pre-judgment taking of property without notice and hearing, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment was granted to the homeowner on the ground that the contractor was not licensed to enter into a contract to build the home because the ultimate cost of the residence exceeded $ 50,000 and was thus barred from bringing the action. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that (1) the contract between the parties was never finalized; (2) although a price of $ 40,000 to $ 45,000 was discussed, no firm price was ever agreed upon; (3) no set of final plans was ever agreed upon; and (5) the contractor billed and was paid on a monthly basis. The court held that even if the contractor had violated the New Mexico Construction Industries Licensing Act (Act), N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 67-35-1 67-35-63 (1953), he nevertheless substantially complied with the licensing requirements. The court reasoned that when the parties agreed to begin construction on a cost plus percentage basis with monthly billings, the contractor held a valid license. The court also noted that the contractor renewed his license seven months after the house was completed, so that he was financially responsible for up $ 100,000.</SPAN></P>

The court held that provisions reserving to the people the power of initiative and referendum were to be given a liberal construction to effectuate the policy being adopted. New Mexico recognized that technical irregularities did not necessarily required that the results of an election be disturbed. In addition, the election laws were liberally construed to accomplish their purpose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had previously issued a temporary writ in the case preventing the Secretary of State from certifying candidates for state offices without the payment of filing fees. In a separate action certain citizens received a judgment from a three-judge panel in the federal district court that enjoined the Secretary of State from requiring the citizens to pay a filing fee before being listed in the last election as candidates for U.S. Senator. Based on that case, the Attorney General directed the Secretary of State to allow candidates for salaried state offices to be listed as candidates in the coming primary without the payment of filing fees. Respondents claimed that &sect; 3-8-26(A) was unconstitutional and void as a violation of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court disagreed and held that there was a rational relationship between the filing fee requirement and the legislative duty to protect the purity of elections and guard against abuses of the elective franchise in order to meet the requirements of the equal protection safeguards.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Secretary of State sought review of a judgment from the District Court of Santa Fe (New Mexico), which declared that N.M.

The judgment arose from a declaratory action brought by plaintiffs, a political party and a citizen.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that the signature requirements of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-8-2(B), (C) and N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-8-3(C) constituted burdens that prevented minority parties from placing their nominees on the ballot. They predicated their claim upon the &quot;free and open&quot; election provision of N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 8. The court reversed the judgment, finding that the legislature determined that the signature list requirements provided by the statutes were consistent with its authority and duty to secure the purity of elections and guard against abuse. The court concluded that it was its duty to uphold the legislative determination unless satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the legislature went outside its constitutional authority in enacting the requirements. Plaintiffs also contented that the signature requirements under violated their constitutional rights of freedom of association. The court determined the State had a legitimate interest in trying to determine good faith on the part of electors who sign nominating petitions and in assuring at least a modicum of support for a political party and its nominees whose names were placed on the election ballot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner pleaded guilty to an offense in a certain district court. He was sentenced. He filed a document with that court which was treated as a motion for a new trial and denied. He filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and the presiding judge conditionally granted it, based on an assumed denial of the prisoner's right of appeal. The proviso was that the sentencing court might enter an order allowing an appeal before the date set for release, and thus avoid the writ. The sentencing judge was not informed of the order. On the date set for release the State got an order allowing an appeal, but this was not timely. Fifteen days later the time for the State to appeal the habeas order expired. The prisoner filed a second habeas petition, which was reluctantly granted by respondents. The State then filed the writ of prohibition. The court denied the writ of prohibition. The court held that even if the first habeas order were erroneous, the State had not appealed it and was bound by it. The court noted that the second habeas order aptly reflected this reasoning and could not lawfully be prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The partnership purchased a motel in 1968 and also leased the advertising sign on the premises from a franchisor. The face area of the sign exceeded that permitted by a city ordinance adopted in 1964. The partnership's predecessor had constructed the motel, erected the sign in compliance with then-existing ordinances, and entered into a sign lease with the franchisor in 1961. On appeal of the judgment enjoining the city from enforcing the ordinance, the court held that the partnership had no standing to procure the injunction. Rejecting the partnership's claim that its sign lease was a reissue of the original lease and it was thus entitled to the same rights its predecessor had, the court held that the partnership's rights did not vest prior to the passage of the ordinance. The court also determined that the partnership could not claim that the ordinance as applied to it was unconstitutional by reason of the toleration period being arbitrarily short when its rights in the sign were not in existence at the time the ordinance was adopted and when it was aware of the sign ordinance at the time it acquired the motel and had knowingly acquired rights in a non-conforming use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents complained that the effect of the consolidation was that their children would not be attending schools in the district in which the residents were entitled to vote for the school board. In affirming the judgment, the court held that this did not abridge the residents' right to vote. The court held that the right to vote was a franchise granted by the state, not a natural right. The court found nothing in N.M. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 1 or 3, that guaranteed the right to vote for any school board other than the one in which the elector resided, as provided by N.M. Const. art. XII, &sect; 6. The court next held that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-3-3(b) (Interim Supp.1970), which authorized the consolidation, was not a special law in violation of N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 24. The court next held that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-3-3(b) (Interim Supp.1970) did not violate the residents' rights of equal protection and due process secured by N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Lastly, the court held that because the consolidation was authorized by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-3-3(b) (Interim Supp.1970), N.M. Stat.

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 46-1-1 to 46-12-13 (1953), the trial court erred in failing to find that the state legislature had conferred upon state municipalities the discretionary power to approve or disapprove an application for a liquor license. The court held that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46-4-8 (C), in circumstances where the local governing body failed to act for a certain period of time or approved a liquor license transfer, authorized the chief of the division to approve the transfer in his discretion, and it could not be held that the legislature intended local governing bodies to have a broader range of permitted action than the chief of the division.

At issue was the validity of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 8-6-1 to 8-6-13 (1953). The Board of Trustees of the Town of Las Vegas was also a plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All the roads at issue were located within the Mexican Land Grant, also known as the Las Vegas Grant.

An argument presented was that the legislation that made the Board administrator was special legislation that violated the Springer Act, 48 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1471 and the N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 24. The court held that the prohibitions against special legislation in the Springer Act and in the N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 24, were not applicable to enactments that related to the governing or managing bodies of specific community land grants or to the manner in which these bodies used their powers of control, management, and disposition over grant lands. The court's rationale was based, inter alia, on a lengthy legislative history of enactments that related to the control or management of the land of specific grants. The court rejected the argument that there was no substantial evidence for the trial court's findings.

</DIV>

Plaintiffs refused to pay the fee, contending that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court agreed and granted plaintiffs' request for declaratory relief. On appeal, the court affirmed, reasoning that nn actual controversy existed under the New Mexico Declaratory Judgment Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-6-1 (1953 Comp.). Having questioned the constitutional validity of the applicable statutes, ordinances, and regulations, plaintiffs were not required to exhaust their administrative or statutory remedies. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-18-6 (1953 Comp.) did not specifically confer any right upon the City to exact the fee per lot and the ordinance was not drafted such that its provisions came under the general police power of the City.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an election held for the purpose of voting on general obligation bonds for three municipal improvements, the elector filed an application for a recount, alleging that unqualified voters were permitted to cast ballots in the election.

In affirming, the court concluded that a vendee in a real estate contract was a person owning property within the statutory and constitutional requirements. Further, a veteran and his wife, by virtue of claiming the soldiers' exemption to the payment of real estate tax granted by a constitutional amendment, became taxpayers and were thus qualified to vote. The soldiers' exemption amendment to the state constitution was the payment of that portion of a veteran's property tax by the state; by claiming the exemption, the veteran consented to payment of his taxes by the state.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a Special Assistant Attorney General, challenged an order of the District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico), which quashed an alternative writ of mandamus directing appellee, the Director of the Department of Finance, to approve a reimbursement voucher to pay for appellant's out-of-state travel. Appellant contended that appellee had a clear ministerial duty to approve the voucher under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11-1-9(E).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was granted an alternative writ of mandamus which ordered appellee to approve a reimbursement voucher to pay for appellant's out-of-state travel. Subsequently, the trial court quashed the writ, and appellant challenged the ruling. Appellant contended that appellee had a clear ministerial duty, involving no discretion, to approve the voucher under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11-1-9(E). Appellant argued that, because the statute stated that &quot;public funds shall not be expended to reimburse public officers without written authorization from the governor or his designee,&quot; the legislature meant that where funds were budgeted and appropriated for a legitimate purpose, the governor's designee had a clear and undisputed statutory duty to approve the voucher. On review, the court held that, pursuant to the statute, appellee was authorized to adopt rules and regulations for exception from gubernatorial authorization. The court found no legislative intent that appellee was required to approve all state vouchers merely because appropriated funds were available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general refused to issue a bond transcript submitted by the school board after an election because the board did not maintain separate ballot boxes for voters, separating real estate owners from non-owners as mandated by N.M.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state, by the attorney general, appealed a judgment in favor of the director of the state department of alcoholic and beverage control on a counterclaim asserted in response to the attorney general's declaratory action. The attorney general urged that the liquor law statute at issue permitted the sale and consumption of alcohol by the drink on the premises of licensed dispensers on Sundays. The director contended that the lower court correctly found that the uncodified law, 1969 N.M. Laws ch. 216, &sect; 1 precluded the sale by drink during Sundays, permitting only the service and consumption in accordance with a proposed regulation. The court dispensed with the argument that an actual controversy was lacking, finding that the situation concerned an administrative stalemate between two public officers when the attorney general was charged with administering the laws while the director was charged with enforcing liquor laws. The court found that under the plain and proper construction of the legislature's purposeful omission of the word sell in the applicable clause, the sale and consumption of liquor by the drink on licensed premises was not permitted on Sundays.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners asserted lack of jurisdiction and that district court erred in enjoining its action. The court made permanent the alternative writ of prohibition and declared the district court's restraining order null and void, holding that the district court erred in staying the suspension because there was no showing of bad faith or abuse of discretion on the part of the racing board of stewards or the commission, and that due process did not required that a hearing be held prior to the suspension of state licensed individuals.

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 72-16-1 - 72-16-47 (1953), on gross receipts from management and engineering services and from equipment rental.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the corporation's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the action was barred by the applicable statute of limitations, N.M.

Ann. &sect; 72-21-25 was insufficiently expressed in the title to the House Bill in which it was incorporated to meet constitutional requirements. The court reversed the judgment, finding that &sect; 72-21-25 was void. The court did not find that the natural reaction to a reading of the entire title to House Bill would be that a limitation on the collection of the privilege tax on businesses other than oil and gas producers would be included in the body of the House Bill. The court found that the title did not alert readers to the limitation since neither the title nor the body of the House Bill provided for any such limitation on the collection of the enumerated privilege taxes. Because &sect; 72-21-25's limitation provision was not germane to either the general subject of House Bill or the express wording of its title, the court concluded that the attempt to include the provision was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statute of limitations relied upon for granting summary judgment was void and remanded the action to the trial court to reinstate the cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility was a private corporation that operated a gas distribution system in the city pursuant to a franchise agreement. An urban renewal project that was mostly funded by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) forced the utility to remove and partially relocate certain of its utility lines from streets and alleys in the area covered by the project. HUD regulations prohibited compensation to private utilities for removal and relocation expenses, so the city was compensated for its removal costs but the utility was not. It brought an action against the agency and the city seeking to recover its costs. The trial court entered judgment against the utility and it appealed, arguing, inter alia, that it was entitled to compensation because the requirement to remove its lines constituted a complete ouster and was therefore a taking of property without due process of law. The court affirmed, holding that the removal and partial relocation of the utility's lines at its own expense was a condition of its franchise, was required by the valid exercise of defendants' police power, and did not constitute an ouster which would entitle the utility to compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When some applicants sought to change the location of a water well by applying to the state engineer pursuant to N.M.

The court dismissed the case, holding that the trial court's judgment was void because the amendments to &sect; 75-11-7 that allowed de novo review of such an application by the district court violated N.M. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, the separation of powers clause. The statute assigned an administrative function to the district court; it did not just review the state engineer's decision, it made the decision de novo. Neither did the adoption of N.M. Const. art.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-1-3. The trial court also held that the ranch could only recover against the coal mine owner in an adverse condemnation action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A coal mine owner operated a coal mine, and sought to make water available to the mine. In order to do so, the coal mine owner had to intrude upon the land of a ranch, and either drill for water or transverse upon the land with a pipeline. The coal mine sought to do so without seeking permission of the ranch pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-1-3 (1953) and commenced suit for a declaration of rights. The trial court granted summary judgment to the coal mine owner, and held that the coal mine owner had the power under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-1-3 (1953) to use the ranch's lands, and that the exclusive remedy of the ranch was that of &quot;inverse condemnation,&quot; as provided by N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-9-22 (1953). On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held: (1) the use of water by the coal mine owners was a public use; (2) it was permissible to take the land of the ranch to convey water; (3) the act permitting condemnation for rights of way of water was not vulnerable to attack, because it was in the public interest to distribute water; and (4) the coal mine owner was only liable for damages to the ranch in an inverse condemnation action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he should have been sentenced to a fixed, determined number of years. The court disagreed, holding that the trial court's sentence was the proper imposition of both a minimum and maximum penalty as prescribed by law. At the time of the offense, the applicable statutory penalty for second-degree murder was imprisonment for any period of time not less than three years. In prescribing a minimum penalty, but not a maximum penalty, the legislature by implication authorized a penalty in excess of the minimum. Because a maximum penalty was authorized by implication, there was no unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bondholder petitioned for mandamus to compel the commissioners to levy a tax of mills alleged to be necessary to pay the principal and interest on the district's bonds.

The trial court allowed the property owner to intervene and he then moved for an order to set aside the previous judgment and to dismiss the bondholder's petition asserting that the bond issue was invalid because no valid bond election had ever been held. The trial court withdrew the writ of mandamus and ordered the county officials to remove the levy from the tax rolls. The bondholder appealed asserting that the order permitting the intervention was improper and untimely. The court agreed as, when the intervention order was entered, there was no controversy existing between the bondholder and the commissioners.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, tax assessor and tax association, sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico), which held in favor of respondents, tax commission and veterans, that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-1-11 was constitutional. Respondents also sought review of a judgment stating that although &sect; 72-1-13 was unconstitutional, it was a severable provision from an otherwise constitutional statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state brought an action for the assessor against the commission, questioning the constitutionality of &sect; 72-1-13. The trial court entered a two-part judgment, and both parties sought review of the decision. On appeal, the court remanded the case to the trial court for dismissal. The court held that appellants had no standing to bring the cause of action. The court found that there was no allegation or finding that the assessor would be injured or jeopardized by the questioned laws. In addition, the court stated that although the tax association was an association comprised of veteran taxpayers, none of the members alleged any injuries or jeopardized rights. The court found that the members were not similarly situated within the meaning of &sect; 21-1-1(23), as adequate representation on behalf of those entitled to the exemption would have conflicted with the interests of those who were not. The court therefore found that appellants could not allege by amendments to their complaints the &quot;personal stake&quot; required, and there was no actual controversy within the meaning of &sect; 22-6-1. Thus, the court stated that it was not necessary to determine the matters raised by the cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

The airplane service went ahead and performed the inspection and completed the repairs it determined were required. After payment was not forthcoming, the airplane service filed suit seeking to compel payment. The trial court awarded the airplane service damages for the inspection work and related repairs, but not the nose repair because it was not properly done, along with attorney fees. The airplane owner sought review contending that it did not authorize the inspection repairs and challenged the attorney fee award. The court affirmed holding that there was substantial evidence to support to support the trial judge's decision as to liability to pay for the repairs. Pursuant to N.M. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the prospective jurors were unconstitutionally dismissed because they expressed general objections to the death penalty on conscientious and religious grounds, improper questioning by the district attorney upon cross examination of defendant brought about by statements which created prejudice in the minds of the jury against defendant, and the statute imposing the death penalty and death sentence were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court stated that a statute had become effective a few months before had abolished death penalty for murder. With respect to the district attorney's questioning, the court stated that it was not improper because defendant made voluntary statements, even after being repeatedly stopped by the court and also after he had been dismissed as a witness. The court, noting that defendant had been admonished not to volunteer statements, but he continued to do so, stated that voluntary statements could not be a basis for reversal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation filed a proof of claim against decedent's estate. The motions of appellee administratrix and heirs to dismiss the claim was granted by the District Court of Roosevelt County (New Mexico) for failure to comply with N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 31-8-2, 31-8-3 (1953) in that a notice of hearing was not timely served on the administratrix. The corporation's appeal challenged the constitutionality of the statutory notice provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation apparently concedes there was support for the trial court's ruling on the motions to dismiss the claim. It was contended, however, that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 31-8-2 and 31-8-3 (1953), were unconstitutional because the notice of hearing requirement was not clearly expressed in the title to the statutes. It was not necessary that the title to a legislative enactment be an index of everything in the act itself; the title only had to give notice of the subject matter of the legislation. The title was sufficient if, by application of every reasonable intendment in favor of its validity, it may be said that the subject of the legislative enactment was expressed in its title. In the court's view, the challenged legislation did not offend N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16. The two statutes were in pari materia and had to be read together. There were two mandatory steps the corporation had to take for the claim to be allowed: (a) filing a claim; and (b) notice of hearing thereon. Both requirements had to be met; otherwise, the claim was barred. The corporation failed the requirement of notice of hearing. The trial court's judgment was not disturbed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 77-17-1 to 77-17-14 (1953).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority was a nonprofit corporation. The district court determined that the plan authorized by the School Leasing Law and followed by the authority permitted the creation of a debt in excess of the limits permitted by N.M. Const. art. IX, &sect; 11. The district court further ruled that the plan provided for lease payments which constituted a debt and that no provision for a special fund or for revenue to pay the same was made, except out of state appropriation. In addition, the district court held that the plan as contemplated and authorized the School Leasing Law by would have permitted the levying of ad valorem taxes to make lease payments and would have constituted a debt prohibited by art. IX, &sect; 11. Appellants sought review. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment. The court concluded that the authority was clearly nothing more nor less than the school district acting through a public entity other than its regularly designated Board. The court further found that the procedure authorized by the School Leasing Law was simply an effort by indirection to avoid the provisions of art. IX, &sect; 11, when it could not have been done directly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board member was a certified teacher and was elected a member of the Board, which previously had adopted a resolution requiring the suspension of the teaching certificate of a teacher elected to the Board. Upon being served with an order to show cause why his teaching certificate should not be suspended, the Board member sought and was granted an injunction restraining and enjoining the Board from enforcing its resolution or suspending his teaching certificate. The Board appealed, but the court affirmed the district court's judgment. Although the Board relied upon N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-8-19(A) (1953) for its authority to suspend the Board member's teaching certificate, an examination of the Act requiring the licensing of school teachers convinced the court that its purpose is to protect the public against incompetent teachers and to insure proper educational qualifications, personal fitness, and a high standard of teaching performance. The suspension of a teacher for incompatibility with membership on the Board did not fall within the purpose of insuring a high quality of public instruction.</SPAN></P>

The basic issue on appeal were whether the jury verdict was supported by substantial evidence or was so excessive as to require a reversal or remittitur. The Commission contended that the award was shockingly excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee was in possession of the land in question pursuant to a so-called &quot;business lease,&quot; which had been originally issued in 1938 and thereafter renewed each five years. The lessee had purchased the lease in 1948 and had renewed the lease at least once. He had added a considerable amount of improvements and operated the property as a store, service station, curio shop, bar, and two rental rooms. The court stated that, while the award was higher than it would have found if it were the trier of the facts, it could not hold as a matter of law that the award should have been reversed. The Commission asserted error in the trial court's refusal to submit interrogatories to the jury to make it possible to determine what amount of damages was ascribed to each element considered. The court stated that it was not necessary to consider each requested interrogatory in order to arrive at a conclusion concerning the correctness of the ruling. The trial court had reasonable discretion in the matter of what questions should have been submitted to the jury for special findings and, unless that discretion was abused, it would not be disturbed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant New Mexico State Highway Commission sought review of a judgment from District Court of Torrance County (New Mexico), which in a condemnation action awarded appellee lessee damages. The basic issues on appeal were whether the jury verdict was supported by substantial evidence, or was so excessive as to require a reversal or remittitur. The Commission contended that the award was shockingly excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee was in possession of the land in question pursuant to a so-called &quot;business lease,&quot; which had been originally issued in 1938, and thereafter renewed each five years. The lessee had purchased the lease in 1948 and had renewed the lease at least once. He had added a considerable amount of improvements and operated the property as a store, service station, curio shop, bar, and rented two rooms. The court stated that while the award was higher than it would have found if it were the trier of the facts, that it could not hold as a matter of law that the award should have been reversed. The Commission asserted error in the trial court's refusal to submit interrogatories to the jury to make it possible to determine what amount of damages was ascribed to each element considered. The court stated that it was not necessary to consider each requested interrogatory in order to arrive at a conclusion concerning the correctness of the ruling. The court noted that the trial court had reasonable discretion in the matter of what questions should have been submitted to the jury for special findings, and unless that discretion was abused, it would not be disturbed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of New Mexico, acting on behalf of appellants, property owners in a school district, challenged a judgment of the trial court (New Mexico) that denied their petition for an order of mandamus to dissolve a school district consolidation and that dismissed their action seeking the order against appellees, the New Mexico State Board of Education, the New Mexico State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and two school districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Board ordered the disputed consolidation after the board of the district in which the owners resided and the board of a district in another county passed consolidation resolutions. The owners contended that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 73-20-3 (Repealed 1967) did not authorize inter-county consolidations. The court reversed the trial court judgment, holding that the attempted consolidation was a nullity. Language in the first paragraph of &sect; 73-20-3 limited consolidation to &quot;two or more rural school districts within the county,&quot; and the court disagreed with appellees' argument that language in the second paragraph, added in 1955, removed the limitation. Had the legislature intended to amend the statute to allow consolidation between districts in different counties, the court held that it would have done so unambiguously. Appellees did not proceed under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 73-20-5 (Repealed 1967), which did allow inter-county consolidations. Because the districts were operating as if consolidated at the time of its decision, the court directed that the order was not to be made effective until July 1, 1969, provided that in the interim a consolidation had not been properly effected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the action to the trial court for further proceedings. It directed that the trial court order to be entered pursuant to its mandate was to be made effective July 1, 1969, provided that in the interim a consolidation in conformity with law had not been effectuated.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 67-7-13(m).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operators' CATV system received television signals from Texas stations and circulated them by cable to their New Mexico subscribers. Those stations broadcast price advertisements of Texas optical firms. Such advertising was prohibited in New Mexico by &sect; 67-7-13(m) but was not prohibited under Texas law. The district court enjoined enforcement of &sect; 67-7-13(m) against the operators, finding that they were not &quot;advertising&quot; and that &sect; 67-7-13(m), as applied to the operators, violated N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18. On appeal, the court affirmed without reaching the constitutional issue. The court noted that the operators did not sell advertising space or receive compensation from either the broadcasters or their advertisers but simply carried the signals to additional viewers. The exposure of the price advertising to the subscribers was only incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and did not amount to &quot;advertising&quot; by the operators.</SPAN></P>

The claimants made application to repurchase the tract from the tax commission and received a deed upon the showing that they had paid certain taxes. The trial court held that the original owner's title was extinguished by de facto condemnation, that the original owner's quitclaim deed conveyed no title, and that the tax sale and the deed to the claimants had no effect on the State's title to the property. The trial court held that the State had absolute fee simple title, which was transferred to the penitentiary. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that because the penitentiary statute was a special act, it prevailed over the general tax statute. The court held that the State did not take property without due process of law because the original owner failed to timely redeem, and the right to repurchase did not come into existence. The court held that, thus, the claimants acquired no valid interest upon which any redemption could operate to justify the issuance of a proper deed from the tax commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state auditor filed an original mandamus proceeding that challenged the validity of 1965 N.M. Laws ch. 287 (N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 4-24-1 to 4-24-25 (1953). The state auditor claimed that the statute was unconstitutional because it removed substantially all powers and duties of a constitutionally established office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original mandamus proceeding, the state auditor challenged a statute that provided for a transfer from the state auditor to the legislative audit commission of all equipment, supplies, records, and any other property or thing held by him in his official capacity; and after a certain date to reduce the salary of the state auditor to $ 1.00 per year. The auditor would have retained only some minor duties. The New Mexico Constitution designated the executive officers of the State, and specifically included the state auditor; however, it was silent with respect to any duties of that office. The court held that the legislature could not by statute abolish a constitutional office nor deprive the office of a single prescribed constitutional duty. Nor could the legislature abolish the office indirectly, by removing all statutory duties, thereby leaving the office in name only, an empty shell. The court noted that a earlier effort to amend the constitution to abolish the office of state auditor had failed. The court found that the duties removed were implicit in the office of state auditor and declared the statute to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion for post-conviction relief under &sect; 21-1-1(93). The district court denied defendant's motion. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant's confession was voluntary because the evidence demonstrated that defendant had sufficient mental capacity at the time of his confession to be conscious of what he was doing, to retain memory of his actions, and to relate with reasonable accuracy the details of his actions. Further, any error that the district court might have made over proper objection did not invoke the doctrine of fundamental error because it could not seriously be suggested defendant's innocence appeared indisputable.

The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment of the driver and the father, finding that the car was owned by the driver and he was protected by the guest statute under N.M. Stat.

The court held that it was error for the trial court to disregard the certificate of title. The court ruled that summary judgment should not have been granted because there was an issue of fact on the question of ownership. The case was remanded with instructions to grant a trial against the driver. The court concluded that there was no claim of gross negligence or wilful misconduct as to the driver.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The businesses filed a complaint against the city that alleged the city had failed to pass an ordinance imposing a lawful license tax in accordance with the provisions of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46-4-2. The city answered and, upon consideration of the businesses' motion, the pleadings and depositions of the city's mayor, the trial court granted summary judgment. The city appealed the judgment. The narrow point on appeal was whether the ordinance imposed a valid license tax for a tax period beginning on a specified date. The city argued that the ordinance remained in effect until it was amended or repealed. The businesses argued that the statute required the enactment of a license tax ordinance annually in order to have a valid imposition of the tax. The trial court sustained the businesses' contention and granted their motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court determined that the amount, the date, and manner of payment fixed by the ordinance remained from year to year until such time the ordinance was modified or repealed by an ordinance of the legislative body enacting the same. Accordingly, the trial court's grant of summary judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

P. 93, N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-1-1(93) (1953). On appeal, the inmate, who was serving a sentence for escape, contended that his incarceration on the charge of escape was unlawful because his underlying detention for a violation of ordinances against drunkenness was in violation of his constitutional rights under U.S. Const. amends. VIII and XIV. The inmate admitted that he was a chronic alcoholic and argued that confining him as a violator of the criminal ordinances amounted to punishing him for an illness. The court held that as long as the commitment to custody was valid on its face, it was no defense to a charge of escape that the incarceration was based on a violation of a law which was allegedly unconstitutionally applied. The inmate also argued that the court failed to adequately inform him of his rights at his arraignment when he waived counsel and pled guilty to the escape charge. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the trial court's finding that defendant's waiver was knowingly and voluntarily made was supported by the a preponderance of evidence.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico) rendered judgment in favor of the State. Plaintiffs' appeals were consolidated for decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, residents of Texas, were civilians employed by the federal government at a missile range in New Mexico. The state had ceded jurisdiction of the property to the United States, reserving only the right to serve process. Prior to the cession of jurisdiction, the United States had passed the Buck Act, 4 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 104-110, which provided in part that no person was relieved from liability for a state income tax by reason of receiving income from services performed in a federal area. Plaintiffs challenged the jurisdiction of the State to levy an income tax on their wages. On appeal of a judgment in favor of the State, the court affirmed. The court held that the Buck Act had to be accorded prospective operation. It refused to presume an intention on the part of the legislature to cede its taxing power in the absence of a clear showing to the contrary. The court also rejected plaintiffs' argument that the income tax levied a tax upon personal property within the meaning of N.M. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2 and was in excess of the rates allowed in that section. The court held that the income tax was not levied upon real or personal property as those words were used in art.

The juvenile was made a ward of the court until the age of 21, or until further order of the court, and was ordered committed to a state boys' school during that period. He was in the physical custody of the sheriff pending delivery to the school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile presented three serious questions for review: was the juvenile code adopted in 1955 and the juvenile court therein created constitutional; was the denial of a trial by jury a denial of constitutional rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution and the New Mexico Constitution; and was the fact that the juvenile received a penalty different from that provided when adults violated the same provisions of law deny the juvenile due process of law and equal protection of the law? The court granted a permanent writ of habeas corpus. In so ruling, the court concluded that the denial of a jury trial by the juvenile court was error. The court ruled that a juvenile charged with violation of a state law is entitled to a trial by jury in juvenile court if there is no certification to district court under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-8-27 and if the offense was one which would be triable by jury if committed by an adult.

On review, the court sustained the motion and found that &sect; 21-2-1.12 violated U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV. The court noted that the commissioners' recommendation was not binding and that the attorney was entitled to a determination by the court. Because the facts developed at the hearing had to be incorporated in a transcript, full consideration could only be accomplished by submitting the transcript and giving the attorney an opportunity to indicate in what portion of the transcript the charges of misconduct as found by the commissioners were not supported or the discipline recommended was not justified.

VII, &sect; 3, insofar as it required a favorable vote of not less than two-thirds of those voting in each county to amend N.M. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New Mexico was the only state in which there were no provisions for absentee voting. Several attempts to amend the state constitution to provide for absentee voting were unsuccessful because of the requirement that any amendment to N.M. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, be approved by a two-thirds favorable vote in every county and by at least three-fourths of the electors voting in the entire state. The court concluded that the requirement of a two-thirds favorable vote in every county resulted in greatly disproportionate values to votes in the different counties. Proposition 7 was passed by 81.8 percent of the voters who voted on the proposal but not by two-thirds favorable vote in every county. The court noted that under the Baker v. Carr rationale, it could see no rational basis to distinguish between voting for representatives in the legislature and voting on constitutional amendments. The requirement of &quot;at least three-fourths of the electors voting in the whole state&quot; was met when that percentage voting on the particular proposition favored it.

Defendant also asserted that at trial, his counsel was ineffective for failing to file a plea of abatement, failing to request that jurors be released during their deliberations, and for &quot;permitting&quot; accomplice testimony. The trial court denied defendant's motion for post-conviction relief without a hearing. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a hearing based on the substance of his claims. The court further held that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel where there was no indication that the trial was a travesty or a sham. Finally, the court held that defendant's claim that the former felony murder statute violated equal protection and due process had to be denied because defendant failed to allege what classification he belonged to that was treated unfairly or how the vagueness claim applied to him. The court explained that constitutional claims could only be considered when defendant alleged how the propositions applied to him.</SPAN></P>

He did not appeal his conviction, but filed a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that he was improperly being held.

The court also determined that the juvenile court was authorized by N.M. Stat.

Finally, the court concluded that because the juvenile requested and was denied a trial by jury, the juvenile court violated his rights to due process.

The inmate had also been charged with escape on February 5, 1965, to which he pleaded insanity. A psychiatric report was received September 20, 1965. In October 1965 the inmate was tried and convicted on the escape charge, for which he was serving a sentence in the penitentiary when he filed his mandamus against the trial judge. The court held that the inmate's speedy trial rights were not waived when he was in custody on other charges. The court held that inmate took no affirmative steps to make known his demand for a speedy trial, and that motions filed in the escape action did not equate to requests for speedy trial in the forgery action. In discharging the mandamus the court held that the inmate's prosecution for escape, incarceration for that offense, and his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity all constitute reasons making the delay in his prosecution reasonable.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed he was obliged to sign a trustee's pledge that escape would carry an additional penalty of two years. The court held that cruel and unusual punishment applied to inhuman and barbarous treatment, not to the duration of the sentence as was claimed by defendant. The court held that the sentence was void and could therefore be vacated, and that the State's failure to abide by it was no error.

The trial court upheld the validity of the amendment, implementing statutes, and the election resolution in all respects; the city clerk and the taxpayers appealed. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, holding that the application of the legislation was not confined to any precinct and was not confined to any particular affair or affairs of a precinct. It applied equally to all municipalities and to all counties in New Mexico. It was the court's opinion that the statutes did not fall within the constitutional prohibition against special or local laws regulating precinct affairs.

The trial court found the Act unconstitutional and the board was not required to pay the funds to the hospital. In the instant case the county had budgeted and levied the full 20 mills to pay indigent hospital claims, and the voters had voted against a levy exceeding that budgeted amount to pay further indigent hospital claims. The court held that since the county had budged the full 20 mills, and the voters had refused to authorize an additional levy in excess of that amount to pay hospital bills of indigents, the statute which attempted to authorize the creation of a public debt could only be characterized as a device for circumventing the limitation of N.M.

The taxpayers asserted that they were not &quot;engaged in business&quot; in the state as they did not hold themselves out as engaging in business in New Mexico, did not advertise in the state, nor sell or distributed goods in state. The taxpayers conducted intermittent development tests of missiles, launching equipment, guidance systems, radar, and data collection in New Mexico.

The court found that the evidence of continuous testing in New Mexico supported that finding and the imposition of the tax. The court also found that the tax being imposed on receipts due to the testing conducted by the taxpayers was fair as the activities involved in the testing were sufficiently disjoined from the interstate operation so that those activities were a local incident or business activity and that the receipts of such activity were taxable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were defendants in a proceeding filed in the district court less than two years before the effective date of N.M.

After the passage of two, but less than three years from the date of filing, the case had not been finally determined, and petitioners filed a motion to dismiss under N.M. R. Ann. 1-41(e). N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 132 (1965), purported to amend N.M. R. Ann. 1-41(e) so as to increase the time for taking action to bring proceedings to a final determination from two years after filing to three years and, in addition, to exempt entirely from the rule's operation proceedings wherein jury action had been demanded. The trial court overruled the motion finding N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 132 (1965) to be applicable to proceedings pending when it went into effect. A writ of prohibition and mandamus was sought and the court issued an alternative writ. On hearing of the matter the court made the writ permanent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retail liquor dealer, appealed an order of the District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico), which denied the dealer's petition for injunctive relief an the dealer's action for a declaratory judgment to determine the constitutionality of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 46-9-1, 46-9-3, and 46-9-11 (1953), or, in the alternative, an injunction to prohibit enforcement of those provisions of the law by defendant director of the liquor division.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealer challenged the constitutionality of three statutes,&nbsp;N.M. Stat.

Under the statutes, sales of trademarked liquor at less than the contract price constituted unfair competition. Such a sale gave rise to a right of action by anyone damaged thereby, and subjected the dealer to criminal penalties, whether or not the dealer was a party to the contract. The trial court held that there was a failure to prove the challenged provisions to be unconstitutional and denied injunctive relief. The dealer appealed, and the court reversed and held that the statutes at issue were unconstitutional and void. The court held that the fair-trade contract and markup provisions of the Liquor Control Act were manifestly unreasonable legislation, were not an appropriate exercise of the state's police power, and were in violation of N.M. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 4 and 18.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a writ of habeas corpus and contended that his imprisonment was unlawful because he was not furnished appointed counsel at his parole revocation hearing and evidence of escape from a Tennessee court was not sufficient evidence of violation of parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was sentenced after conviction, then was paroled to a detainer to serve another sentence in Tennessee. By letter from the Tennessee penal farm, the warden was advised that the inmate had escaped. The inmate was apprehended and following a hearing on the violation of the terms of his parole, his parole was revoked. The court held that there was no constitutional right to an attorney in a parole revocation proceeding. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-17-27 (1953) indicated that the parole board was not required to hear statements or arguments by attorneys. The requirements for a hearing on the parole violation, set forth in N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-17-28(C) (1953), did not by implication give the inmate the right to effective appearance or representation by counsel. Because the parole was an act of clemency or grace extended by the parole board, ordinary procedural rules did not apply as in criminal proceedings. In discharging the petition, the court held that the evidence from the Tennessee penal farm, in the form of a letter advising of the inmate's escape, was sufficient because strict observance of technical rules was not required in a hearing before an administrative body.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court discharged the petition and remanded the inmate to custody.</SPAN></P>

After the order authorizing entry, the landowners sold the entire property to the buyers. The buyers then filed a plat of a subdivision with the county that showed the entire acreage and the 35-foot strip for the road. The trial court held that the city was obligated to pay the landowners for the strip. The court held that the city's taking of the property was complete before sale to the buyers because the city had installed curbs, gutters, and pavement. The court held that the dedication in the plat did not waive the liability to pay compensation because there was no dedication of the 35-foot strip. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the city used its power of eminent domain to take the strip before the land was dedicated by plat, and it remained liable to pay the landowners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, City of Albuquerque and the City Commission of Albuquerque and its members, sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico), which rezoned petitioner property owners' tract to C-1 and enjoined respondents from requiring a replat of the tract as a condition for either changing the zone maps or issuing building permits to the property owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reversing the judgment, the court found that to the extent that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-28-16, (1953) purported to allow the district court to zone land, it was void as an unconstitutional delegation of power to the judiciary, contravening N.M. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-28-16 (1953) provided for a record that showed on what grounds the decision was made. However, the return to the writ showed recommendations made by the planning department, the decision of the planning commission, and the decision of the city commission. There was nothing in the return to the writ to show the grounds of the decision appealed from. Further, when the trial court issued its writ, the tract was zoned R-2, conditioned on a replat. Respondents did not appeal that portion of the trial court's judgment enjoining enforcement of the condition. Accordingly, that portion of the injunction was in effect. However, the portion of the injunction pertaining to building permits was not within any issue raised by the proceedings, nor was it litigated. Not being within the issues, that part of the injunction pertaining to building permits was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause with instructions to the trial court to set aside the judgment and enter a new judgment enjoining respondents from enforcing the condition to R-2 zoning, to give respondents an opportunity to amend their return to the writ, and to decide whether denial of C-1 zoning was arbitrary as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public utility company brought a declaratory judgment action to determine whether it was subject to N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5-6-17 (1953), relating to public meetings of all governing bodies of the state that are supported by public funds. The public utility company claimed that the statute did not apply to it where its sole function was of a business nature without any control over financial matters or the fixing of rates and that, if the statute applied, it was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court held that all final decisions made by the public utility company should be made at open meetings. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that: (1) the public utility company, which had an obligation to pay over to the city all income not consumed in the operation of the electric utility system, was supported by public funds within the meaning of &sect; 5-6-17; (2) the title to the statute was not so misleading as to be unconstitutional under N.M.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public utility challenged the grant of the certificate to the electric cooperative and raised the issue of the constitutionality of an act that amended N.M.

The court held that there was no supportable or rational basis for permitting the electric cooperative to serve selected individuals who were not members of the cooperative with entire freedom from control of its rates, while at the same time the utility, when serving the same individuals, was required to charge for such service only such rates as the Commission approved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a store clerk was killed during a robbery attempt an arrest warrant for defendant was issued. The complaint upon which the warrant was issued charged that defendant fled the state of New Mexico and traveled interstate commerce to avoid prosecution in New Mexico for armed robbery. Defendant was arrested in San Diego, California, by a Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) agent acting under the authority of the warrant. Defendant was taken to the San Diego F.B.I. office where a set of his fingerprints were obtained. The fingerprints were later introduced in evidence at a preliminary hearing and at his trial. Defendant was found guilty of the murder. On review, defendant's major assertion was that the lower court erred when it failed to suppress the evidence concerning the fingerprints. Defendant asserted that the arrest was illegal because the warrant had been issued on a complaint, which was insufficient, because it did not show the necessary probable cause for his arrest. The court remanded. The court held that the complaint was deficient and the resulting arrest was therefore illegal and the fingerprints should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the act was unconstitutional under N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 29 and the commission appealed the ruling. The court held that the laws passed by the legislature were entitled to a presumption of legality, and would not be declared illegal unless it exceeded the bounds of the constitution. The court stated that the act was not unconstitutional because it did not violate art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general contractor constructed buildings for the federal government and paid taxes to the state on proceeds received in performing the contract. Three years later, the contractor petitioned for a refund under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-16-23 (1953), claiming that the taxes were erroneously paid. Following a hearing, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Revenue of the State of New Mexico denied the refund application after concluding that a refund was not permitted based upon a mistake of law. The contractor appealed, and the district court concluded that the contractor was entitled to a refund of the amount unlawfully paid. The commissioner appealed the adverse ruling. In reversing, the court concluded that, under N.M. Stat. &sect; 72-16-28 (1953), where the legality of an assessment was challenged, taxes were to be paid under protest.

The New Mexico Junior College was created and funded under the Act. Plaintiffs claimed that the Act was unconstitutional in their action. The district court ruled against them and they sought review. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment. The court rejected plaintiffs' argument that the Act required board members to reside in the junior college district, in violation of N.M. Const. art. V, &sect; 13, on the theory that the board members were state officers, not district officers, and therefore their residence could not be restricted. The court held that board members were not elective public officers in the sense as used in N.M. Const. art. VII, &sect; 2 and that the legislature could have justifiably set their qualifications.

Defendant was tried before a jury on the issue of prior convictions. Defendant contended that he only had pro forma representation in the prior convictions.

The court held that he failed to establish his right to release on a writ of habeas corpus.

II, &sect; 7 provided that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus should not be suspended. The writ of habeas corpus was a collateral attack on a judgment upon which commitment had issued, and would lie only when the judgment under attack was absolutely void because the court which rendered the judgment was without jurisdiction. There was nothing wrong in the appellate court receiving evidence outside the record to establish the absence or loss of jurisdiction through denial of any of the rights guaranteed to a prisoner at the bar by either the United States or New Mexico Constitutions. Here, the evidence offered was properly received and entitled to consideration by the appellate court.

In affirming, the court concluded that, while public property held and used in a proprietary, rather than governmental, capacity could not be taken for another public use without payment of just compensation, the operation of a school by a state institution was a governmental rather than a proprietary function.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding in mandamus, relator county taxpayers sought an alternative writ of mandamus seeking to require respondents, the governor and 11 state boards or commissions, to return and thereafter maintain the main offices of the executive agencies at the State capital and not elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fundamental question involved in the mandamus action related to the meaning of N.M. Const. art. V, &sect; 1, and whether it mandatorily required that all officers of the executive department to maintain their offices at the capital. The State capital was located in the county in which the taxpayers lived and voted. After consideration of the law, the court concluded that the alternative writ of mandamus was improvidently issued and discharged it. The court held that the taxpayers lacked standing to raise the constitutional question in their mandamus action. It was not the duty of the court or any other court to sit in judgment upon the action of the executive branch of the government except when the question was presented by a litigant claiming to be adversely affected by the executive act on the particular ground complained of. The court concluded that a citizen was without standing to question the constitutionality of a statute. The court found that, rather than to apply to the courts for relief, the taxpayers had other remedies such as through the elective process or appealing to the legislature.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the legislature had not delegated its authority to make a law, but had delegated power to determine facts upon which the law makes its own action depend. The court held that the title of the bond act gave reasonable notice of the subject matter of the statute and that it had not violated N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16. The court found that the bond act did not constitute the incurrence of indebtedness in violation of N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 29 and N.M. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 7 and 8. The bond act did not contravene N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18 because it did not amend 1963 N.M.

The Supreme Court, Noble, J., held that privilege tax provision exempting state contractors (who had previously been exempt in any case) from liability with respect to existing lump-sum or unit price contracts for particular projects if contracts would not allow increase to cover privilege tax was not unconstitutional as in violation of requirements of equal protection or equality and uniformity of taxation.  </SPAN></P>

The tax was imposed on five unit price contracts after they had been made. An issue presented by the appeal concerned the constitutionality of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-16-5(D) (1953).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-16-5(D) (1953) provided an exemption from an emergency school tax imposed on gross receipts from any lump sum or unit price contract for a particular project entered into before the effective date of the tax where the contract did not by its terms allow the contractor to increase his price to cover the tax. In the refund action, the trial court ruled that the exemption contravened the equality and uniformity clause of N.M. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 and the equal protection clauses of N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On appeal, the court rejected the contention that the exemption created a special, unreasonable class and that the denial of the exemption to others amounted to discrimination. The court found that only those having a cost-plus or cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract were claimed to have been denied the benefit of the exemption, but such contracts automatically included the tax where there was no express agreement to the contrary and, ergo, were different from lump sum or unit price contracts. The court held that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-16-5(D) (1953) was a proper use of legislative power. Thus, remand was required.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court, Carmody, J., held that resolution calling for school bond election, notice of election, ballot, and resolution publication calling for election and in one way or another stating that purpose of the election was to issue bonds for school purposes rendered election proceedings invalid under constitutional prohibition against borrowing of money by school district except for erecting and furnishing school buildings and purchasing school grounds, notwithstanding claimed presumption that money raised would be used for constitutional purposes.  </SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court ruled that &sect;&sect; 73-8-31 and 73-8-32 provided a limitation period for district court suits to contest the bond issue's validity and not to the exercise of the Attorney General's statutory duty. The court also ruled that the description of &quot;for school purposes&quot; was too general and encompassed uses of funds other than that permitted by N.M. Const. art. IX, &sect; 11.

The district court concluded that the gross receipts which were the basis for the taxes paid under protest after were not exempt under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-16-5 of the Emergency School Tax Act, that the exemption was constitutional; and that the corporation's claim was to be denied and dismissed. The corporation contended that since &sect; 72-16-5 exempted those who sold personal tangible property to the government but did not exempt him as the vendor of services it was a violation of his constitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and N.M. Const. at. II, &sect; 18. The court held that legislature intended to tax the privilege of conducting certain businesses as provided in &sect;&sect; 72-16-4.1 to 72-16-4.13, and intended, as expressed in &sect; 72-16-5, to exempt certain transactions.

The District Court of Santa Fe County, Samuel Z. Montoya, D. J., sustained a motion to dismiss the complaint, and plaintiff appealed.  The Supreme Court, Carmody, J., held that where state money was used together with matching federal funds to pay seller of feed furnished to farmers and ranchers in emergency, and statute appropriating state funds for such purpose was subsequently held unconstitutional as donation of public funds, state could recover amounts so paid, notwithstanding good faith of payment and receipt.  </SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the attorney general made demand upon the farmers for restitution of the monies that they had received under the program. When restitution was not made, the state filed an action to recover the money. The farmers filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the court reversed and held: (1) the farmers received a gratuity, not of the funds but only the benefit therefrom, under the cooperative agreement between the state and the federal government; (2) public monies were trust funds belonging to the people, and were required to be reimbursed by the recipients if they were paid out illegally by a public official, even though in good faith; and (3) whether the benefit was &quot;in cash or in kind&quot; made no difference, as the fact that it was an outright donation made it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the District Court of Curry County (New Mexico), which enhanced his sentence for conviction of a second felony as provided by the habitual criminal act under N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-16-1 (1953). Defendant pled guilty to rape of a female, having previously been convicted of statutory rape.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The validity of the habitual criminal act was challenged on the ground that 1955 N.M. Laws ch. 150, the indeterminate sentence law, repealed N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-16-1 (1953) by implication. In addition, defendant asserted that the increased penalty for a second felony conviction could not be applied under the language of the indeterminate sentence statute; and, that N.M. Stat. &sect; 41-17-1 repealed N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-16-1 (1953) by implication. The court affirmed. The court held that there was no obstacle imposed by the indeterminate sentence law to complying with the provisions of &sect; 41-16-1. Further, the court was unable to agree with defendant's argument that the indeterminate sentence law, the later legislative enactment, related to the same subject matter, or was one fully covering the subject matter of, the habitual criminal statute. The court held that the indeterminate sentence law merely provided that the sentencing judge should impose the minimum and maximum sentence that was provided by law. The court noted that the increased penalty that was provided by the habitual criminal statute was the penalty that was provided by law.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the company had valid easements for the entire disputed portion of the lines. The court found that the commission had notice of the occupancy and rights of the company and took its right of way easements subject to the burden of the right of the company to maintain its lines on the lands in question. The commission was in no position to claim any damages which the previous landowners could have suffered because knowledge of the previous owners of the construction of the company's lines on their line could be properly inferred, and only the previous owners had the right to damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission brought an action to enjoin the State Engineer from expending the funds appropriated to him on the ground that the appropriations violated the provisions of the Ferguson Act of June 21, 1898, 30 Stat. 484, and the New Mexico Constitution. The Commission contended the appropriations were void as a breach of the trust imposed by the Ferguson Act as they were for purposes, such as maintenance, other than those for which the grant was made and for which the fund was created, which was establishment of reservoirs. The court held that the term &quot;establishment&quot; as used in the Ferguson Act included the permanent regulation of use of water stored naturally or coming directly from natural sources as well as the establishment of other permanent reservoirs. Th court concluded that the appropriations were not in violation of neither N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 24, 26, 31, nor N.M. Const. art. IX, &sect; 14. The appropriation legislation did not constitute inappropriate special laws, did not impermissibly benefit any corporation, did not impermissibly benefit charitable organizations not under the control of the state, and did not constitute a donation to any corporation.</SPAN></P>

The water the city sought to appropriate was part of the base flow of the Rio Grande River.

The district court reversed, finding that the city held ancient pueblo water rights that granted it an absolute and unconditional right to divert as much of the surface and underground water of the Rio Grande as was necessary for its use and the use of its inhabitants. The engineer appealed. The court reversed, holding (1) the district court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the city's pueblo water rights because the issue was not before the engineer, (2) the engineer had the authority to consider the effects on surface rights holders of the appropriation of water from an underground basin, (3) the engineer had the authority to require the city to retire certain surface water rights as a precondition to granting the permits, and (4) the water rights of a municipality were subject to the state's regulatory authority.</SPAN></P>

Section 21-3-16, with one immaterial exception, was adopted verbatim from Illinois. The court presumed that the New Mexico Legislature, in adopting the statute, also adopted the prior construction of the statute by the highest courts of Illinois, which held that the Illinois act merely established a new mode of obtaining jurisdiction of the person of a defendant in order to secure existing rights, and that the Illinois act was applicable to rights of action which arose before the act was adopted.</SPAN></P>

From a judgment of the District Court, Sante Fe County, James M. Scarborough, D. J., the plaintiffs appealed and defendants cross-appealed.  The Supreme Court, Noble, J., held, inter alia, that allegedly invalid section of statute relating to gross receipts from contract for particular project entered into prior to effective date of statute is severable from remainder, and remainder is constitutional, and that the imposition of the tax upon one rendering services to the United States does not constitute a prohibited tax to the United States.  </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the section was severable, leaving the remainder of the statute intact. The court held that the deletion of the offending subsection in no way affected the enforceability of the other portions of the statute. The other section were clear, certain, and unambiguous, and they were not so connected either in subject or purpose with the invalid portions that the legislature would not have enacted the remainder if it had known that the one subsection was invalid. The court found no merit to the contractors' contention that the statute had the effect of levying an unconstitutional tax upon the United States, its agencies, or departments.</SPAN></P>

Although formal and elaborate findings were not absolutely necessary, basic jurisdictional findings, supported by evidence, were required to show that the commission followed the law. The court found that the commission should have been permitted to participate in the appeal to the trial court. Because the commission was a necessary adverse party, it was error for the trial court to refuse to allow the commission to participate. The trial court erred in allowing additional evidence in an effort to determine whether the commission had exceeded its delegated authority.

After consideration of the facts and the law, the court granted the relator's writ. The court held that respondent's actions were illegal and unconstitutional in that neither in the state constitution nor in any statute had respondent been granted the power to reduce a lawfully made appropriation. The court ruled that respondent could not refuse approval without some basis, and if the budget as submitted was within the amounts appropriated and the items were proper, he was given no discretion except to approve them. The court rejected respondent's argument that N.M. Stat.

The Commissioner filed a petition for a writ of prohibition commanding the Board to refrain from cutting or reducing the budget. The court granted the Commissioner's petition, and issued the writ, holding that the statute relied upon by the Board was unconstitutional. The court found that the unrestricted and unguided power contained in the statute was an unconstitutional grant to the Board of a legislative power. The statute purported to delegate legislative powers to reduce appropriations to the executive and such powers were non-delegable under N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22 and N.M. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Mexico legislature enacted 1957 N.M. Laws 237, which provided for reimbursement to public utilities for the relocation of their facilities. The court later declared portions of Chapter 237 unconstitutional, but failed to rule on whether petitioner city was entitled to repayment of relocation costs, which it had by reason of moving municipally owned facilities from its municipally owned right of way. Petitioners brought a writ of mandamus to recoup funds spent these relocation costs. The legislature had passed 1959 N.M. Laws 310 that authorized the commission itself to expend public funds for the relocation of utility facilities. Chapter 310 also stated that the utility, as to relocations, was under the absolute control of the commission and was merely acting as a contractor for the state. The court granted the writ and made it absolute, holding that under Chapter 310 there was a legitimate and equitable apportionment of costs of relocations rather than a donation to utility companies. The court found Chapter 310 constitutional, but overruled State Highway Commission v. Southern Union Gas Co., 1958, 65 N.M. 84, 332 P.2d 1007.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutory suit for adjudication of rights to water in the Roswell Artesian Basin.  The District Court, Chaves County, E. T. Hensley, Jr., D. J., made an order from which an appeal was taken.  The Supreme Court, Moise, J., held that a landowner who lawfully initiated development of an underground water right and carried it to completion with reasonable diligence acquired a water right with a priority date as of the beginning of his work, notwithstanding the fact that the lands involved were put into a declared artesian basin before work was completed and water put to beneficial use on the ground.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners disputed an order by the District Court, Chaves County (New Mexico), which denied them any rights to water from an artesian basin. The court considered the effect of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-11-4 (1953) and whether the doctrine of relation applied so as to protect the landowners in any rights which they had initiated but which had not fully vested due to an order by a state engineer extending the basin to include their lands.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The water at issue was used for crop irrigation for several years before appellee State of New Mexico began the action. On appeal from a ruling that the landowners had no rights to the water, the court reviewed the history of the statutory underground water laws. In particular, the court noted that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 75-11-1 to 75-11-10 (1953) included a declaration that public waters were subject to appropriation for beneficial use. The court held that the statutory law as it existed at the time in no way controlled or interfered with the landowners' right to undertake development and to complete the appropriation of the basin water. The court held that the substance and intent of &sect; 75-11-4 (1953) was the same as that of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-8-1 (1953), originally enacted in 1907, which was held to recognize the doctrine of relation. Based on the doctrine, the court held that, because the landowners began drilling the well before the state engineer's order and proceeded diligently to develop the water, they acquired a valid water right before the order extending the basin, and that right was not affected by the order. The court reversed and remanded with instructions.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, saying that there was substantial evidence that plaintiff's negligence was the proximate cause of the loss. The general rule is that a bank paid checks at its peril, but defendant bank in this instance established its own due care and also established that plaintiff was negligent because plaintiff failed to review the cancelled checks it received or compare them to invoices. Although the burden was on the bank to establish the depositor's negligence in order to relieve the bank of liability, the burden was met by evidence that showed that no one at plaintiff's organization examined the checks.</SPAN></P>

The prevention of monopolies, the fostering of fair competition, and the prohibition of unfair trade practices promoted the public welfare. The Act was not price-fixing legislation but merely prohibited the sale of cigarettes at below cost. The Act was not arbitrary or discriminatory, even though it permitted one wholesaler to sell to another wholesaler below cost but denied wholesalers the right to sell below cost to retailers privileged to buy direct from the manufacturer. N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;49-3-3(b) (1953) was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action against city for personal injuries arising out of an accident involving a dump truck owned by city and driven by city employee.  The District Court, Bernalillo County, John B. McManus, Jr., D. J., dismissed the action and plaintiffs appealed.  The Supreme Court, Moise, J., held that city was a &quot;political subdivision&quot; within statute which provided for liability insurance on all vehicles owned by state and operated by employees, agents or officials of state, or any of its institutions, agencies or political subdivisions but which further provided that actions for damages resulting from operation of such vehicles should be brought against the driver and not against the state or its &quot;political subdivisions&quot;, and that city was protected from suit.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought review of judgments from the District Court, Bernalillo County (New Mexico), which dismissed three separate personal injury actions against defendant city arising out of an accident involving a dump truck owned by the city and driven by a city employee. The trial court held that the provisions of N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 64-25-9 (1953) protected the city from suit. The cases were consolidated for appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal of the dismissal of their personal injury actions against the city, plaintiffs argued that &sect; 64-25-9 did not apply to municipal corporations and that if it did apply, it was unconstitutional because the title did not meet the requirements of N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16. The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the headings in both N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 64-25-8 and 64-25-9, which referred to &quot;state vehicles,&quot; were not part of the law but were merely descriptive. The court held that municipal corporations were political subdivisions of the state and therefore, the personal injury action could not be maintained against the city under the statutes. The court also held that the use of the term &quot;state&quot; in the title of the act creating the statutes did not render it unconstitutional under N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16. The act was neither a hodgepodge nor &quot;log-rolling&quot; legislation. The inclusion of political subdivisions of the state within the broader term &quot;state&quot; did not work surprise or fraud upon the legislature. Nor could the public fail to take notice that the components that made up the state were included in the term &quot;state.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The District Court, Curry County, George T. Harris, D. J., entered judgment for city and defendants appealed.  The Supreme Court, Chavez, J., held that municipality acted beyond scope of its authority in attempting to collect garbage assessments by bringing suit for debt upon a personal obligation against parties who refused to pay sums assessed, but that property owner, whose sewers had long since been paid for, could be compelled to help finance extensions of sewer system into new areas of municipality, and to help finance new sewage disposal facilities made necessary by such extensions.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 14-40-38, which authorized such use of sewer assessment revenues by the city, was constitutional.

The Supreme Court, Carmody, J., held that evidence of a record of traffic violations was sufficient to sustain six-month suspension of license but court had no jurisdiction to enlarge the term of suspension and held, also, that commissioner was empowered to refuse to renew a driver's license in a proper case where to grant a renewal, would be to permit the avoidance of the consequences of suspension.  </SPAN></P>

The driver appealed, and the district court's judgment was superseded after the driver furnished an appeal bond. While the case was pending, the driver filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was moot because his license had expired by its own terms. The driver also sought to have the district court's judgment be declared inadmissible in any future proceeding. The court remanded the case to the district court, with direction to set aside its judgment and to enter one sustaining the commissioner's order. The court held that the district court erred in enlarging the term of the suspension because such action was beyond its jurisdiction. The court stated that the driver's motion to dismiss his appeal was without merit because the commissioner had a definite and tangible standard to determine whether or not a driver was a habitual reckless or negligent driver.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action under the Declaratory Judgment Act seeking a judicial determination of the legality of regulation promulgated by the Board of Trustees of a hospital.  From an adverse judgment in the District Court, Roosevelt County, John R. Brand, D. J., the plaintiffs appealed.  The Supreme Court, Carmody, J., held that the statutes respecting osteopathic physicians do not require a governing board of a public hospital to afford to osteopathic surgeons and physicians the same treatment as is given to doctors of medicine who are graduates of American Medical Association approved colleges.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, osteopathic doctors, filed an action under the Declaratory Judgment Act, N.M. Comp. Stat. &sect; 22-6-1 et seq. (1953), seeking a judicial determination of the legality of a regulation promulgated by defendants, hospital trustees. The District Court of Roosevelt County (New Mexico) sustained the trustees' motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to state a cause of action. The doctors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctors argued that N.M. Comp. Stat. &sect; 67-8-12 (1957) required the governing board of a public hospital to afford to osteopathic surgeons and physicians the same treatment as was given to doctors of medicine who were graduates of American Medical Association approved colleges or, in other words, that the legislature intended to place osteopathic physicians on the same footing as medical doctors in every respect. The court examined the history of the act, including amendments and repealed sections to reach a contrary position. A fair analysis of the statute in question would be that the first two paragraphs placed osteopaths on equal footing with medical doctors, but that the third paragraph reserved to the governing boards of public hospitals full control over the making of regulations to determine who should be on the staff, irrespective of the so-called equal rights given to osteopaths. If it were otherwise, there would have been no reason for the elimination of the &quot;anti-discrimination&quot; and &quot;permissive removal from the staff&quot; provisions of the 1947 law. The court held that the regulation was not unreasonable nor arbitrary nor contrary to the statutes New Mexico.</SPAN></P>

Following this announcement, the State of New Mexico, the commission, and others petitioned for a writ of prohibition to preclude the district court judge from receiving additional evidence. A temporary writ issued, and the matter proceeded for hearing. In discharging the temporary writ, the court concluded that it would not exercise superintending control over the district court to prevent it from error. The fact that the district court might be on the verge of wrongly deciding a matter before it was of no concern to the court, nor was it material that it might, on review, be compelled to reverse the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding on telephone company's application for removal of Corporation Commission's order suspending effective date of new tariffs sought by telephone company relative to some eight communities, for 90 days or until determination of reasonableness and lawfulness of rate.  The Supreme Court, Carmody, J., held that where telephone company applied for increase in telephone rates for some eight communities and after statement of telephone company's position and without any witnesses testifying or exhibits introduced Commission ordered suspension of new tariffs pending state wide rate investigation, action of Commission was without any hearing whatsoever and in violation of constitutional mandate and hence suspension order could not be enforced.  </SPAN></P>

On the same day, respondent New Mexico Corporation Commission entered its order of removal. The Commission had entered an order directing an investigation of the rates throughout the State of New Mexico, and suspended the proposed tariffs pending its later determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the Commission's order of suspension was within its authority under N.M. Const. art. XI. The Commission based its order upon a rule that it had adopted permitting the suspension of rates. The court determined that it had jurisdiction over the case as a &quot;prospective refusal&quot; on the part of the utility to obey the order, which was an equivalent of a failure or refusal to obey the order. The court opined that during the entire day that the matter was before the Commission for a hearing, not a single witness was sworn, nor was any evidence of any nature submitted to or by the Commission. In the court's view, that was not the full and complete hearing contemplated by N.M. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8, and the order of the Commission could not be enforced. Further, the provision in the Commission's rule allowing for suspension of rates was a substantive matter that the Commission was without power to exercise under the New Mexico Constitution. Before the entry of any order of suspension, the Commission was required to holding a full and complete hearing, after which the Commission was expected to be in a position to finally rule as to the rates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the suspension order of the Commission was invalid and was not entitled to enforcement.</SPAN></P>

The district court quoted the jury the constitutional provision relative to the governor's power to pardon and reprieve and statutory provisions concerning the authority of the parole board. The court held that the response was fair and did not indicate what the jury should or should not do. The court held that finding of the body in Valencia County and the police officer's testimony were sufficient to warrant the jury in concluding the deceased was killed in Valencia County. The record supported the conviction of a first-degree murder conviction upon the theory that the killing was done in the perpetration of a robbery. The court found no error in the jury instructions. The criminal acts of defendant were admitted. The court held the acts were relevant to prove identity.

The District Court, Bernalillo County, D. A. Macpherson, Jr., D. J., entered judgment enjoining enforcement of the ordinances, and the city appealed, and the plaintiffs cross-appealed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a class action by plaintiff property owners, appellant City of Albuquerque, New Mexico disputed a judgment of the District Court of Bernalillo County (New Mexico), which declared Albuquerque, N.M., Ordinances 1075, 1085 illegal and void. The issues included whether N.M. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-40-38, 14-39-2 (1953) authorized the ordinances, whether exemptions or distinctions in the ordinances were authorized, and whether &sect; 14-40-38 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinances were so-called standby ordinances under which the City was authorized to make assessments against unconnected property by which water or sewer pipes ran, i.e., the water and sewer mains stood by ready to serve the property. Ordinances 1075 and 1085 were purportedly enacted under the authority of &sect;&sect; 14-40-38, 14-39-2, respectively.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-39-7 through 14-39-13 and 14-39-17 through 14-39-25, the water and sewer revenue bond act. But, the sewer standby fees were permitted by &sect; 14-40-38, as amended by 1941 N.M. Laws 17. Nevertheless, there was no statutory authority for the exemptions from the fees or for distinctions between platted or subdivided property and unplatted or unsubdivided property. Finally, the court held that, because &sect; 14-40-38 conferred a benefit upon the property subject to the sewer standby charge, the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court, Shillinglaw, J., held that construction of highways is a public governmental function but that relocation of utility's facilities is not; and that insofar as 1957 legislation provided for reimbursing utilities for costs of relocations necessitated by highway construction it was invalid for repugnancy to constitutional prohibition against donation of state funds in aid of private corporations.</SPAN></P>

The gas company argued that the legislature determined that relocation costs were part of highway construction and the court was precluded from determining the reasonableness of that conclusion. The construction of highways was a public government function, but the relocation of utilities was not. Section 55-7-18 was unconstitutional.

The court held that the legislature was free to impose the Emergency Act tax on the seller and the Compensating Act tax on the purchaser, and that this classification did not violate equal protection.

The court reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to vacate its previous order and enter an order denying the motion to dismiss. The court held that the city had standing to bring the action because it alleged injury when the state labor commissioner set an arbitrary wage scale. Section 6-6-6 did not give the state labor commissioner the power to set a minimum scale of what he thought the wages should have been. The state labor commissioner's duty was to determine the prevailing ways in the locality for like work. Section 6-6-6 did not require that he hold hearings, but he had to investigate and determine the prevailing scale as a result of his own investigation. The state was not an indispensable party to the action. Because the city alleged that the state labor commissioner disregarded the requirements of &sect; 6-6-6, the matter was properly subject to judicial review.

In affirming the judgment the court held that the motel was a hotel within the meaning of &sect; 49-6-1. The court held that it was not the name of the business but rather the services it provided in determining whether it was a hotel. The court noted that the motel had all of the most salient features of any hotel, only on a smaller scale, and thus was embraced within the act. The court then held that the limitation of liability pertained to articles deposited with the motel for safekeeping.

The trial court, refusing to grant full faith and credit to the Arkansas judgment, entered a judgment of divorce for the wife. The court found that, as the husband was in the military service at the time the action was brought and, as both the parties had resided continuously in the state for more than one year, the trial court had jurisdiction to enter a divorce decree. The husband argued that the parties were not domiciled in the state. The court found that the servicemen's divorce statute,&nbsp;N.M. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county board members argued that the order of consolidation of the state board of education on February 5, 1954, under 1945 N.M. Laws ch. 38, &sect; 1, was invalid as the act providing authority for such consolidation had expired by its own terms due to ending of the war with Germany and Japan some years prior. The court disagreed, holding that when the entire act was read together, the only possible construction that could be made to harmonize its parts was that the legislature intended that the amendment of 1945 was to be effective for the duration of the war and one full school term thereafter, and that following this period the amendment was to end and the original act would then continue unamended. In addition, the court held that the superintendent had full authority to complete the consolidation of the schools in question under the order of February 5, 1954. The additional resolution by the state board in 1955 was unnecessary to effect the consolidation, but was merely an additional stimulus for her to act. The requirements of 1955 N.M. Laws ch. 100, &sect; 1, did not have to be complied with in order for the consolidation to be valid.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the debtor's action and quieted title in favor of the creditors. The debtor appealed and contended that the Act was unconstitutional because its title did not clearly express the subject of the bill and that it embraced more than one subject, in violation of N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16. The court affirmed and held that the act clearly expressed its single subject. The court rejected the debtor's argument that the Act attempted to revise substantive law by reference in violation of N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18, and held that the Act granted an optional procedure for the enforcement of judgment liens. The court also rejected the debtor's argument of various irregularities in the foreclosure proceedings. Following the entry of judgment and during the time the debtor was trying to redeem the property, he remained in possession as a tenant of the foreclosure purchaser and made no objection to the proceedings, and, therefore, ratified them.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court, McGhee, J., held that statute providing that sheriff who has execution in his hands may serve written notice upon any person indebted to debtor not to pay indebtedness but to appear before court out of which execution issued and make true answer under oath concerning such indebtedness does not allow the court to enter judgment against a garnishee for more than could be recovered against him by the principal debtor or to enter judgment solely because of garnishee's default in answering within time required by law.  </SPAN></P>

Nine days thereafter, the garnishee answered, saying he owed the defendant the sum of $ 16.66. Execution was issued against the garnishee who then filed a motion for stay of execution. The motion was granted and an order issued setting aside the judgment against the garnishee. The judgment creditor appealed. The court affirmed on condition.

The court relied on several maxims of statutory construction in reaching its conclusion, including that where two meanings were possible and one would make a statute unconstitutional, it could be presumed that the legislature did not intend to legislate unconstitutionally; and that where general and specific words in a statute were associated together, the general words were restricted to a sense analogous to the less general.

Distributor answered and counterclaimed for injunction against further sales by retailer at prices below those fixed by distributor.  Second distributor brought suit against retailer for injunction to restrain sales at prices less than those established by second distributor.  The two cases were consolidated.  The District Court, Bernalillo County, Robert W. Reidy, D. J., held the Fair Trade Act constitutional and entered injunctions.  The retailer appealed.  The Supreme Court, Carmody, District Judge, held that section two of the Fair Trade Act which provides that sale of trade-marked items at a price less than that stipulated to is a violation of the Act whether the seller is a party to the stipulated price contract or not, is unconstitutional and void as an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of the police power without a substantial relation to the public health, safety or general welfare insofar as it concerns persons who are not parties to the price contract.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the case and the drug store appealed. The court held that the restraint of prices below those fixed by the distributor harmed consumers and did not protect any right of the distributor or manufacturer. The court also stated that refusing to allow the drug store to sell at prices below minimum prices was anti-competitive and violated the Fair Trade Act. Finally, the court concluded that the distributor and manufacturer violated the drug store's rights because it denied them life, liberty, or property without due process of law since it was not a party to any contract with the distributor.

Such statutes were to be liberally construed in favor of the municipality. The property owners also argued that appellees committed fraud by not giving the resolution the usual publicity. The court noted that notice was not required by &sect; 14-6-8. Statutes could provide for annexation without notice. If notice were required, the recorded actions of the municipality provided constructive notice. Although &sect; 14-6-8 provided that certain conditions such as contiguity, platting, and description had to be met before annexation, it also provided that a determination of the existence of those conditions only could be had if an appeal was timely taken.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state engineer sought to enjoin a property owner from using water from an artesian basin for tracts on its farm. On one tract, the district court held that the owner had a definite water right, but the court reversed based on an error as to acreage. On the remaining tracts, A and B, the state engineer showed that there was no evidence that tract A was irrigated. The owner urged that tract A had been irrigated from a well that it sought to plug. Its application for a new well was granted, but caused an investigation that showed only 176.7 acres out of 240 were cultivated. On review, the court held that the evidence presented by the owner as to the use of water on tract A was vague when weighed against a hydrographic survey that showed tract A as unirrigated salt grassland. The court found that the survey and former owners' acquiescence for a new well permit compelled the court to hold that tract A did not have a valid water right. However, the owner produced a witness who farmed tract B and neighbors that saw the land being worked, which established a water right and supported denial of the injunction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State of New Mexico, on the relation of the Governor of the State of New Mexico and the president of the State Board of Finance, brought an original mandamus proceeding in the Supreme Court against the State Auditor and the State Treasurer to compel the State Auditor and the State Treasurer to make available to the State Board of Finance $ 200,000 appropriated by statute.  The Supreme Court, McGhee, J., held that act making appropriations to State Board of Finance for &quot;federal-state cooperative agreement for the roughage drought feed program&quot; violates section of the constitution providing that the state shall not directly or indirectly make any donation to or in aid of any person.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New Mexico had been afflicted by a severe drought, which denuded its ranges in almost every area. The livestock industry was in distress. The appropriation was made to pay part of the State's share of emergency hay and roughage certificates, issued to ranchers for their livestock pursuant to a contract between the governor and U.S. Department of Agriculture. The auditor and treasurer had refused to disburse the funds after the state attorney general opined that 1957 N.M. Laws ch. 22 was unconstitutional. The court held that the statute contravened N.M. Const. art. IX, &sect; 14, because the grants to participants in the roughage program constituted donations to private persons. New Mexico had no voice in issuing the certificates to applicants. Rather, direct grants of state funds were made to persons declared eligible by federal agents. Also, participation in the program was not limited to persons who were sick or indigent within the meaning of art. IX, &sect; 14, nor were the funds to be given to the ranchers to prevent them from becoming so. The fact that state contributions were promised under the contract was insufficient to save the appropriation.</SPAN></P>

Actions to recover damages for wrongful deaths were brought against it by plaintiffs, administrators of the estates of the decedents, who died in a collision between the automobile in which they were riding and the carrier's truck.

The highway was hazardous at the time because of iced conditions. There were no witnesses to the accident. However, the automobile was found on its proper side of the highway. The administrators sought recovery under N.M. Comp. Stat. &sect; 22-20-4 (1953). The carrier urged that the decedents lacked the capacity to sue under &sect; 22-20-4. It argued that, at the time of their death, they were over 21 years of age, unmarried, and had no surviving heirs or other persons dependent on them, partially or totally, for their support and maintenance within the meaning of &sect; 22-20-4. The court affirmed the judgment. The decedents had suffered wrongful death within the purview of &sect; 22-20-4 and, though they left no heirs or dependents, the administrators of their estates had the right to sue under the statute to recover the stipulated damage authorized therein for death caused by the carrier's negligence. Further, the carrier failed in its burden to show that the driver of the automobile was contributorily negligent.</SPAN></P>

The District Court, Luna County, A. W. Marshall, D. J., entered order declaring act unconstitutional and permanently enjoined district attorney from enforcing act, and State appealed.  The Supreme Court, Lujan, C.

The District Court, Santa Fe County, James M. Scarborough, D. J., entered orders setting aside revocation on ground of unconstitutionality of liquor control act.  The State appealed.  The Supreme Court held that under constitutional provision authorizing governor to approve or disapprove any part or parts, item or items, of any bill appropriating money, governor properly vetoed provisions of 1939 liquor control bill allowing Sunday sales, even though bill was general legislation which only incidentally contained item of appropriation.  </SPAN></P>

The main issue was whether N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22, which gave the governor the power to item veto, limited the governor's exercise of the power to general appropriation bills.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licenses were revoked because the sellers sold liquor on Sunday in violation of the provisions of 1939 N.M.

The trial court set aside the revocations upon the ground that the governor's action in exercising a partial veto of the part of the Act prohibiting Sunday sales nullified the whole Act. On appeal, the court reviewed the provisions of art. IV, &sect; 22, noting that a later amendment was not material to the issues at bar. The court held that there was nothing in the last sentence of the Act that required the governor, once he acted on a measure submitted to him within the last three days of the legislative session, to return the measure to the legislature. The parts of the bill approved became a law without further action by the legislature. There was no language in the Act synonymous with the phrase &quot;general appropriation bills,&quot; which the framers of art. IV, &sect; 22, being familiar with such language, could have used if they had so intended. Further, there was a presumption that the Act, like any act, was valid.

The District Court, Bernalillo County, John B. McManus, Jr., D. J., entered judgment barring defendant from acting as a bank and it brought error.  The Supreme Court, Sadler, J., held that a corporation could not organize under the general corporation law, rather than under statutes relating to incorporation of companies to engage in the banking business, or under legislation providing for mercantile companies and thereafter conduct a banking business whether or not said corporation had two departments.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court enjoined the corporation and it appealed the ruling. The court held that under N.M. Stat.

The court stated that the corporation here did not operate in a town of less than 1500 people and did not incorporate a mercantile company. The court determined that the trial court correctly enjoined the corporation from acting as a bank. Further, the court observed that an attorney general opinion did not support the corporation and in any event, the court was not bound to follow the opinion of the Attorney General. Finally, the court concluded that the State Banking Act was not unconstitutional or that the state was barred by laches or estoppel from taking any action against the corporation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State, on the relation of the State Highway Commission of New Mexico, brought action against the Commissioner of Public Lands of the State of New Mexico for a declaratory judgment.  The District Court of Santa Fe County, James M. Scarborough, D. J., entered judgment adverse to the State Highway Commission, and it appealed.  The Supreme Court, McGhee, J., held that the Commissioner of Public Lands of New Mexico could charge the State Highway Commission of New Mexico for rights of way or easements for state highways across lands, which had been granted and confirmed to the State of New Mexico in trust for various state institutions and agencies by the Enabling Act when New Mexico was admitted to statehood, and for sand and gravel removed from such lands for use in constructing public highways across the lands.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general rule was that an agency of the state was not to be charged for the use of state property unless specific provision was made. The Enabling Act of June 20, 1910, 36 Stat. 557, provided that the land would be administered and any proceeds would go for the benefit of the various state institutions for which the lands were granted. No part of the proceeds could be diverted to any other purpose. Thus, the court affirmed the trial court and found that the state public lands commissioner must charge the state highway commission for rights of way or easements for state highways across lands that were granted to the state in trust by the Enabling Act when New Mexico was admitted to statehood. The state public lands commissioner must also charge for sand and gravel removed from such lands for use solely in constructing public highways across the trust lands.</SPAN></P>

The District Court, Santa Fe County, David W. Carmody, D. J., entered judgment denying permanent injunction and Board of Accountancy appealed.  The Supreme Court, Sadler, J., held that the 1953 General Appropriations Act under which it was required that balance to Board's credit at the end of fiscal year must be transferred to the general fund, was not unconstitutional, even though some of the funds remaining to the credit of the Board were voluntary contributions.  </SPAN></P>

Of the funds standing to the credit of the Board at the end of the 1954-1955 fiscal year, $ 740 had been contributed by individual accountants to assist in the operations of the Board for the current year. The trial court also found that the General Appropriations Act, 1953 N.M. Laws, ch. 156, was not unconstitutional in requiring the reverter to the general fund of balances remaining to the credit of any of enumerated boards at the end of the fiscal year. The Board contended that the court could not apply the mandate found in &sect; 5 of the Act to the credit that represented the voluntary contributions by its member accountants to enable the Board to carry on its operations. The court held that, once those funds were deposited in the state treasury and became commingled with the Board's other funds, they could only be withdrawn through appropriations made by the legislature upon warrants drawn by the proper officer, N.M.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant operated a business that contained the term &quot;drug sundries&quot; in its name. No pharmacist was employed on the premises. Defendant was charged with violating N.M. Stat.

Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute as a deprivation of his private property rights, as an unreasonable exercise of the police power, and as creating a monopoly by pharmacists. The court held that the regulation of selling drugs and medicines was so intimately connected with the health, safety, and welfare of the public that it fell within the lawful exercise of the State's police power. The statute did not create monopoly or restrain trade because it expressly permitted the sale of other products by non-pharmacists under certain conditions. In reversing the judgment, the court held that the statute did not prevent citizens from following a calling because it only placed conditions and requirements on that exercise of liberty. The statute offended neither the federal or State constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the granting of the relief sought reached beyond the right to the waters owned by the district, affected the public domain and treasury, and interfered with public administration. The court determined that the judgment would have directly affected the United States, its properties and administration, therefore, the United States was an indispensable party not before the court and that it had not consented to be sued.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suit by seismograph company, a Delaware corporation with principal office and place of business in Oklahoma and no branch office or agencies within New Mexico, for recovery of amount paid for certain taxes on portions of company's gross receipts allegedly attributable to New Mexico operations.  The District Court, Santa Fe County, David W. Carmody, D. J., rendered judgment for company, and appeal was taken.  The Supreme Court, Kiker, J., held that where company made geophysical surveys for oil in New Mexico pursuant to contracts entered into outside New Mexico and principally with nonresidents, and took resulting data to its Oklahoma office for analysis and formulation of opinions for clients, and where no part of company's receipts could be definitely declared as receipts from New Mexico operations, company was not engaged in intrastate business in New Mexico, and tax upon its gross receipts, although pertaining to surveys in New Mexico, was invalid.  </SPAN></P>

The Bureau appealed from a judgment of the District Court, Santa Fe County (New Mexico), which rendered judgment for company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company filed suit for recovery of an amount paid under protest to the Bureau of Revenue, for taxes levied under the Emergency School Tax Act of the state. The company claimed that the taxes were illegally levied for the reasons: (1) the levies were a burden upon interstate commerce in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8; (2) the levies constituted a taking of private property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) the levies, being prohibited by the United States Constitution, were expressly prohibited by the provisions of the Emergency School Tax Act. On appeal, the Bureau of Revenue claimed that the business of the company was interstate commerce so that the tax levied and collected was a violation of the Commerce Clause. The court rejected this argument and affirmed the judgment in favor of the company. The court held that the company's business, as conducted, was interstate. Thus, the tax laid upon the gross receipts of the company from the preparation of opinions and supporting data in Oklahoma, which were delivered to its clients in other states, was invalid.</SPAN></P>

The heir brought a complaint against the administrator and the surety alleging a breach of the administrator's bond in that the administrator had sold certain estate property for a price that was lower than another buyer was willing to pay. The trial court granted a motion for summary judgment against the heir because it concluded as a matter of law that the final decree in the probate of the estate barred the litigation. On appeal, the heir argued that the final decree was conditional and that until the conditions of the discharge were complied with, the decree had no operation as a final decree. The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the heir had failed to object to the sale of the estate property during the probate proceedings in spite of the fact that she had notice that at least one buyer was interested in bidding a higher price for the property. The court dismissed the heir's complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was convicted of possessing burglar tools.  The District Court of Lea County, John R. Brand, D. J., entered judgment, and defendant appealed.  The Supreme Court, McGhee, J., held that criminal intent is an element of the crime defined by act entitled &quot;An Act Defining the Crime of Making, Causing to be Made, or Possessing Any Implements or Things Adapted, Designed or Commonly Used for the Commission of Burglary, Larceny, Safe-Cracking or Other Crime, and Providing a Penalty Therefor&quot;, and that therefore the statute is not unconstitutional on ground that the offense is not encompassed in the title, on ground that it granted to the judiciary powers reserved to the Legislature, or on ground that the state was not required by the statute to prove criminal intent and that therefore the statute was void for indefiniteness and uncertainty.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court, Lea County (New Mexico), that convicted him of possession of things adapted, designed, or commonly used to commit burglary, larceny, safe-cracking, or other crimes under circumstances evincing an intent to use, employ, or allow them to be used or employed in the commission of a crime or knowing that the same were intended to be so used. At issue was the constitutionality of 1925 N.M. Laws 63.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defense's constitutional arguments had three variations, and one of them was that 1925 N.M. Laws 63 violated the N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18 because the State was not required to prove criminal intent but had only to show possession of statutorily described tools or articles under circumstances that evinced an intent to use or employ them in the commission of a crime. The court ruled that the legislature did not intend for ch. 63 to be a malum prohibitum crime, that was, the State was required to prove specific intent. This interpretive conclusion was partly based on the lack of any language in ch. 63 that clearly indicated that criminal intent was not required and also on the language of ch. 63 regarding evincing an intent. A statute was to be construed with common law in mind, and the existence of a criminal intent was to be regarded as required for conviction albeit the terms of the statute construed did not say it.</SPAN></P>

The District Court, Bernalillo County, Edwin L. Swope, D. J., found in favor of the plaintiffs and defendants appealed.  The Supreme Court, Compton, C.

Defendants sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded to the trial court. The court found that the City had acted properly in disencumbering itself of property that it had determined was no longer of public use, and that there was no evidence supporting the trial court's determination that the City had adopted and was bound by the provisions of the Planning Commission Act, N.M. Comp. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-2-14 et seq. (1953).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a minor, appealed from the judgments of his convictions of the District Court, Lea County (New Mexico). In prior proceedings in juvenile court, an order issued binding him over to the district court for trial, wherein two new criminal complaints were filed and later consolidated. His motions to quash the complaint and transfer the case back to juvenile court were overruled. A jury convicted him of voluntary manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot to death his stepmother and his young half-sister when he was 14 and 1/2 years of age. Both victims died instantly. Initially, he had forced his stepmother, at gunpoint, to write checks for him as part of his plan to run away. Thereafter, he attempted to confine the victims but the stepmother suddenly had turned toward him. He fired at them in a state of panic. He left the scene planning to escape, but drove to the sheriff's office and confessed the crimes. He urged as error the district court's failure to remand his case to the juvenile court. He claimed, inter alia, that N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-8-7 (1953) unconstitutionally gave district courts unbridled discretion in deciding whether to try an accused person as an adult or as a juvenile. The court affirmed his convictions, as &sect; 13-8-7 was constitutional. It was not too vague and indefinite for enforcement, and vested jurisdiction in the district court to try juveniles under the age of 18 years for crimes. Defendant's crimes were atrocious and heinous in the extreme. The jury gave full weight to his youth as well as to all other mitigating circumstances as evidenced by the verdict of manslaughter, rather than murder.</SPAN></P>

The District Court, Roosevelt County, E. T. Hensley, Jr., D. J., entered judgment of conviction.  Accused appealed.  The Supreme Court, McGhee, J., held that under statute prohibiting drunken driving and providing that penalty shall be imprisonment for not less than 30 days nor more than one year, but that justices of peace shall have jurisdiction to accept a plea of guilty to first offense and impose a fine of $ 100, the offense was a felony, and section giving jurisdiction to justices of peace conflicted with constitutional grant to District Court of exclusive jurisdiction over felonies, but such section was severable, and portion of statute the accused was tried and sentenced under in District Court was valid, and conviction was proper.  </SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the statute violated the Fourteenth Amendment and N.M. Const. art. II, &sect; 18 by denying equal protection under the law because a defendant brought into a justice court could be fined $ 100 on a plea of guilty while in the district court, the offense was punishable by a sentence of one year imprisonment.

From an adverse judgment of the District Court, Sante Fe County, David W. Carmody, D. J., the Finance Board appealed.  The Supreme Court, Compton, C. J., held that the section of 1953 General Appropriations Act providing that balances remaining to credit of named boards shall revert to general fund, is not, except insofar as it purports to dispose of balances beyond biennium, unconstitutional either as an amendment of Barber's Board Act or as converting latter act from regulatory measure into revenue producing legislation in a general appropriations bill.  </SPAN></P>

The district court ruled in favor of the Barber Examiners and the Finance Board appealed. The court reversed. The court found that the General Appropriations Act (Act), 1953 N.M. Laws ch. 156, &sect; 5, did not amend the New Mexico State Barber Examiners' Act, 1937 N.M. Laws ch. 220, &sect; 21; it superseded the appropriations contained in the Act for the biennium mentioned. The court found that 1937 N.M. Laws. ch. 156, &sect; 9 appropriated all unexpended monies to the general fund to meet the Act, except those previously appropriated for specific purposes, contrary to the Barber Examiners' claim. The court found no merit in the argument that the transfer of surplus funds belonging to the Barber Examiners to the General Fund converted the Barbers' Act from a regulatory to a revenue raising act, thereby antagonizing N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16, as such surpluses were germane to general appropriation acts, and the transfer did not alter its regulatory character, except insofar as it purported to dispose of balances beyond biennium.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court, Compton, J., held that the Act providing in the first section thereof that any public official converting to his own use moneys entrusted to him by virtue of his office is guilty of embezzlement was not rendered unconstitutional and void by the provision therein that the existence of a shortage in money for which such an officer is accountable shall be prima facie evidence of his conversion and embezzlement of such money to the extent of the shortage, nor by the Supreme Court's holding that the second section of the Act, declaring any person converting to his own use another's property in such person's possession guilty of embezzlement, and the repealing clause of the third section, are unconstitutional and void because of omission of the elements of entrustment and fraudulent conversion.  </SPAN></P>

J., entered judgment denying claim of workman for 50 per cent penalty against employer who had allegedly failed to provide safety device for rig on which claimant was injured, and claimant appealed.  The Supreme Court, McGhee, C.

Comp. Stat. &sect; 57-907 (1941), prior to its amendment by 1953 N.M. Laws ch. 96. However, as enrolled, engrossed, and published, 1953 N.M. Laws ch. 96 did not contain a floor amendment which contained the penalty provision for employers. On review, the court noted that, even though the omission of the penalty provision was presumably due to an error or neglect of someone charged with including it in the bill as finally signed, the act was valid, workable, and the only law on safety devices. It penalized workmen who came under the Workmen's Compensation Act whose injuries were caused by a failure to follow statutory safety regulations or the failure to use a safety device provided by the employer. The employer was penalized only where such devices were required by statute. Some language left in the bill by inadvertence did not constitute a grant of power to the New Mexico Labor Industrial Commission to prescribe increased compensation for an employer's failure to provide a safety device but rather was to be treated as surplusage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants adopted rules requiring all teachers to have the equivalent of a major in education, and the teacher completed enough courses to bring her credits up to the requirement. The teacher received notice that her contract would not be renewed based on rule infractions. The state board sustained the teacher's appeal, and when defendants' motion to reopen the appeal was denied, the teacher offered to accept employment. Defendants refused to abide by the state board's order and refused to enter into a contract with the teacher. The trial court ruled against defendants in the teacher's petition for a writ of mandamus, and on appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the teacher was entitled to perfect the required qualifications during her probationary period. Thus, the teacher had tenure at the time the controversy arose. The court also found that the teacher had made the required acceptance of employment within the statutory period. A careful reading of the charges and findings led the court to the conclusion that the state board was entirely correct in its decision.  N.M. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55-1111 (1941), known as the Teacher's Tenure Act, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court, Seymour, J., held that where naval officer arrived in the state on September 18, 1952 under military orders directing permanent change of station to base within the state, and on April 17, 1953 he left the base on temporary duty orders placing him physically with the Pacific Fleet and directing his return to base on completion of temporary duty, and temporary duty was completed and he returned to base on November 6, 1953, and on November 11, 1953, he filed suit for divorce, he came within provision of statute dealing with residence requirement for divorce that persons serving in any military branch of the United States government, who had been continuously stationed in any military base or installation in the state for one year shall be deemed residents in good faith.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 25-704 was not unconstitutional as violating the New Mexico constitutional provision prohibiting local or special laws and guaranteeing equal protection of the laws, N.M. Const. art. 7, &sect; 4, because it did not discriminate between those living on a military base and those who were not. The court also stated that the statute operated uniformly through the state and did not interfere with federal jurisdiction over military bases. Finally, the court concluded that even though the ex-husband left the state for military duties, he was permanently and continuously stationed in the state, and the statute did not require that the ex-husband had to be physically present for the entire time.

The District Court of Santa Fe County, David W. Carmody, D. J., entered judgment adverse to board, and board appealed.  The Supreme Court, Lujan, J., held that 1953 act which repealed the 1947 Retirement Act, and which increased benefits to public employees by permitting those employees, who had annuitant status under the 1947 Retirement Act to participate therein provided that they elected to do so by paying an additional lump sum of money equivalent to one and one half per cent of the total salary received during the last five years immediately preceding retirement, did not violate certain sections of the constitution.  </SPAN></P>

In affirming the judgment compelling the board to pay the participants annuities, the court held that the retirement contract between the board and the participants was changed by mutual consent when the participants' deposits were accepted by the board. The court held that &sect; 10-602(2.1)(6) did not violate N.M. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 27 and 31 or art.

The information charged the prisoner with embezzlement, a common law and statutory offense. Because the offense was otherwise sufficiently charged, the incorrect statutory reference did not render the information invalid or fatally defective. The prisoner was represented by counsel, pled guilty without objecting to the information, and took no appeal. He was not misled as to the charge against him.

The customer filed an action, which alleged discrimination and sought to enjoin the utility from shutting off the gas to the business. The trial court held that the customer had not exhausted his administrative remedies and dismissed the case. The customer appealed, and the court affirmed. The Public Utility Act, N.M. Comp. Stat. &sect; 72-801, provided for a hearing before the commission concerning any rate complaint. The court rejected the customer's argument that relief from discrimination by a public utility was a judicial function. The Act was not a deprivation or ouster of jurisdiction of the courts in violation of N.M. Const. art. VI, &sect; 13, but a postponement until the commission had passed upon the complaint.

After reviewing the law, the court granted the judge's petition for a writ of mandamus. The court agreed with the judges that their appointments were authorized and controlled by N.M.

The court rejected the Governor's argument that art. 20, &sect; 4 applied only in those cases where there was an incumbent in office. The court ruled that under all equations of vacancy in the offices of district attorney and district judge, excepting only a vacancy occurring by the creation of a new judge or district attorney, the terms of district judges and district attorneys would have begun and ended at the same time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Albuquerque, N.M., Ordinance 784, &sect; 6 (1952), the city collected taxes on the sale of gasoline and motor fuel in order to fund electric current used for street lighting in the city's downtown area. The city resident filed suit to enjoin the city from using revenue in this manner, asserting that such a use of the funds was a misuse and contrary to the terms of the ordinance. The trial court dismissed the resident's complaint with prejudice, and the resident appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that the ordinance provided for the collection of taxes upon gasoline or motor fuel to fund street improvement projects and that the payment for electric current for street lighting fell within the scope of the word &quot;improvement&quot; as used in &sect; 6 of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wholesalers of cigarettes brought suit against city and city clerk to enjoin enforcement of city ordinance levying a stamp tax on sale of cigarettes within city, on ground that act, under which ordinance was passed, and which empowers municipalities to fix and collect a tax on sale of cigarettes sold within their limits, is unconstitutional.  The District Court of Santa Fe County, Edwin L. Swope, D. J., entered judgment adverse to wholesalers, and they appealed.  The Supreme Court, McGhee, J., held that the act is not unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cigarette wholesalers appealed a judgment from the District Court of Santa Fe County (New Mexico), which found for defendants, a city and a city clerk, in the wholesalers' action against defendants to enjoin the enforcement of city ordinance levying a stamp tax on sale of cigarettes within the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city sought to enact Santa Fe, N.M., Ordinance No. 1046, which levied a stamp tax on sale of cigarettes within city limits. The wholesalers commenced an action against the city and the city clerk to enjoin the enactment of the ordinance, arguing that 1951 N.M. Laws ch. 92, under which Santa Fe, N.M. Ordinance No. 1046 was passed, was unconstitutional. The trial court found for defendants, and the wholesalers appealed. The court held that 1951 N.M. Laws ch. 92 contemplated and empowered municipalities to impose but a single tax, as evidenced by the repeated use of the word &quot;tax&quot; in singular form and meaning. Even if ch. 92 could be construed to authorize a tax levy at each level of sale, there still would be no double taxation in the prohibited sense because, each time a sale occurred, whether by the distributor, wholesaler, or retailer, there was a taxable act. Chapter 92 was not penal because the punitive provision was inseparably tied to the specifications of ordinances to be adopted under ch. 92. While the levy, collection, and enforcement of the tax were given to the city, the subject of the legislation was not changed and was clearly expressed in the title.</SPAN></P>
