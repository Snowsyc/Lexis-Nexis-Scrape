The court held that there was no statutory or case authority which required consultation between a defendant and his attorney over the issue of whether to appeal a conviction. The decision to appeal was one which the attorney could make in the exercise of his professional judgment in legal matters pertinent to defendant's case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the Village of Northbrook, appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that was rendered for defendant, the County of Cook and certain property owners, in the Village's action to enjoin the County's issuance of a building permit to the owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Village claimed that the owners' proposed construction of two 10-story office buildings on property adjacent to the Village would cause harm to the surrounding residential areas and to the Village itself. The Village sought a declaration that County zoning regulations, which were amended in 1976 and which changed the classification of the property to permit the construction, were unconstitutional. The trial court found that the Village had standing to bring the action but that the action was barred by laches. On appeal, the court rejected defendants' claim that the Village lacked standing, ruling that the Village's allegations, that the proposed development was inconsistent with the residential character of the adjoining area and that property values and services in the Village would be diminished, sufficiently alleged injury to the Village in its corporate capacity to confer standing. The court further ruled that because no justiciable controversy existed at the time the County's ordinance was amended and because the Village filed suit within one month after the owners applied for a permit, the Village's suit was not barred by laches.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that her conviction for bringing contraband into a penal institution under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 31A-1(a)(3) (1981) was void because para. 31A-1(a)(3) was unconstitutionally enacted after action by a governor, who purportedly exceeded the scope of his amendatory veto powers. Defendant asserted that para. 31A-1(a)(3) was added in its entirety by the governor in his amendatory veto letter to the state senate and was subsequently adopted by the general assembly. The State maintained that defendant's failure to raise the issue of the statute's constitutionality in the trial court was a waiver of that issue on appeal. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that defendant failed to present to the court, or more properly to the trial court, any authenticated documents that contained the legislative and executive process that she claimed created a constitutional defect in the enactment of the law. The court was not so compelled under the circumstances to ignore defendant's waiver of the issue. The court also denied defendant's petition for rehearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue raised on appeal was whether the students should be awarded fees and costs pursuant to the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 1014.1(b) (1981). The trial court denied the students' petition because it found that the court had not held the department's Rule I to be invalid. The court affirmed the judgment. Nothing in the court's opinion in any way invalidated a rule of the department. In the action to recover fees, the students were requesting the court to grant the relief, namely declare revised Rule I to be unconstitutional, which both the court and the trial court had denied previously. The court rejected the students' argument that under the definition of &quot;rule&quot; in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 1003.09 (1981), the department's application of revised Rule I to the students was itself a rule. The court specifically preserved the validity of Rule I in its previous opinion. The action taken by the department with respect to the students, which formed the basis of the earlier opinion, was not an agency statement of general application. The students were not within the scope of the attorney fees statute being asserted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a man and a woman, appealed their convictions after a joint bench trial by the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) for retail theft in excess of $ 150 pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 16A-3 (1981). Both defendants contended on appeal that para. 16A-3 was unconstitutional, and the man also argued that he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of stealing cigarettes from a gas station convenience store. They both spent some time in the store, and after they left the clerk noticed the cigarettes were gone. A police officer who pulled their car over found a number of cartons of cigarettes in the car, and the woman admitted to taking them. The court affirmed the convictions, rejecting defendants' argument that para. 16A-3 violated equal protection and due process because theft of property of less than $ 300 was punishable as only a Class A misdemeanor, while retail theft of property not in excess of $ 150 was a Class 3 felony. Identical value differentials between the different types of theft did not have to be maintained to accomplish the legitimate legislative purpose of deterring retail thefts. Further, there was strong circumstantial evidence that the man jointly possessed the cigarettes that were found in the car he was driving, and his recent joint possession of stolen property without a reasonable explanation gave rise to an inference of guilt in the absence of circumstances that would otherwise create a reasonable doubt. Moreover, the inference could support guilt by accountability.</SPAN></P>

A fight ensued, and the manager shot at the men. The commission revoked the licensee's liquor license, and the lower court affirmed. The court reversed and remanded. It held that the manager's conduct was insufficient to warrant the revocation of the license, and the imposition of the sanction was an abuse of discretion by the commission. The manager's conduct off the licensed premises was personal and not fairly related to liquor control. While the dispute originated at the tavern, the firing of the weapon took place at the licensee's home. The altercation that took place at the home was physically removed from the licensed premises and from the motive of control over the activities and patrons of the tavern.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission suspended the officer following a hearing on a complaint charging him with misconduct toward female detainees. The circuit court set aside the commission's decision and directed his discharge from the police force. The court reversed finding that the circuit court acted improperly in imposing a harsher sanction than the commission had. The circuit court properly entertained the commission's cross-complaint, which sought the officer's discharge, because the proceeding was timely commenced when the officer filed his complaint for review of the commission's decision within the statutory period. Even if polygraph evidence was excluded, there was sufficient credible evidence to find the officer guilty. The police chief's request that the officer submit to blood and saliva tests was reasonable in light of the serious charges of sexual misconduct against the officer at the time of the request. The circuit court was unwarranted in discharging the officer because the administrative proceeding was the proper forum to determine the sanction, the record did not indicate that suspension was unreasonable, and the commission specifically rejected discharge as a sanction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff hospital appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissing with prejudice its three count amended complaint for defamation against defendants, a newspaper and its reporter and a hospital accrediting board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital's libel action was filed in the county in which it was located, and the newspaper was granted a change of venue to the county in which it was published, in accord with Ill Ann. Stat. ch. 110, para. 7(4) (1968). In affirming the change of venue, the court held that the special venue statute for newspapers was sufficiently reasonable to withstand constitutional attack. In reversing the order dismissing the hospital's amended complaint, the court held that the &quot;innocent construction&quot; rule had been modified, and that the circuit court should consider the statements in context, with words and the implications therefrom given their natural and obvious meaning. If, as so construed, the statement could reasonably be innocently interpreted, it could not be actionable per se.</SPAN></P>

He appealed his conviction for driving while his blood alcohol concentration was at or in excess of .10 percent, arguing that the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the exact terms of the information as written, that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501(a)(1) (1981) was unconstitutionally vague, and that the trial court erred in giving a jury instruction. The court noted that the information charging defendant with the crime read &quot;at a time when the alcohol concentration in his breath was in excess of 0.10.&quot; It was apparent that defendant was in no way misled in preparing his defense. The strict liability nature of the crime bore directly on defendant's argument that para. 11-501(a)(1) was vague because a person could not determine when his blood alcohol concentration exceeded .10 percent. It did not matter because the liability was absolute. The violation was in the doing, not the knowing. Defendant could not complain of instructions which were given at his behest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A municipality enacted a tax on the use of hotel and motel rooms at the rate of four percent, with a one dollar minimum. Plaintiff motel owners claimed the home rule powers of the municipality to levy the tax had been preempted and that it was not uniform due to the minimum. In reversing a ruling that that tax was invalid, the court found that the Hotel Operator's Occupation Tax Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 481b.31 (1981)) and the occupation tax authorized by the Illinois Municipal Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 8-3-14 (1981)) did not limit the municipality's power to levy the proposed hotel and motel tax. There was no specific restriction on a municipality's home rule powers in either statute. The fact that the minimum tax could have resulted in the tax on certain rooms being higher than on others did not render the tax invalid, as the constitutional provision for uniformity did not call for mathematical equality. Practical uniformity, rather than an absolute one, was the test. Inequalities that resulted occasionally and incidentally in the application of a system that was not arbitrary in its classification were not sufficient to defeat the tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a village's board of public safety commissioners and its director of public safety, appealed from a judgment entered by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which directed that plaintiff police officer be reinstated with back pay and allowances, subject to certain setoffs and exceptions. The police officer filed a cross-appeal with regard to the setoffs and exceptions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board discharged the police officer because he did not maintain his residence in the village. The officer filed an administrative review action challenging his dismissal. That matter was dismissed for want of prosecution. One year later, he filed a court action, which was identical to the administrative proceeding. The trial court set aside the board's decision and ordered the officer reinstated with back pay and allowances. The board and the director of safety appealed from that judgment. The officer filed a cross-appeal. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. Rosemont, Ill., Ordinance 75-9-17A (Sept. 17, 1975) required public safety officials to reside in the village. The court found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 3-14-1 (1975) imposed a residency requirement for firefighters and police officers. While the requirements of para. 3-14-1 could be waived, the court found that Rosemont, Ill., Ordinance 75-9-17A (Sept. 17, 1975) only waived the preemployment requirements for municipal office. It also found that the village did not ignore the officer's place of residence when it hired him and that his equitable estoppel argument failed for that reason.</SPAN></P>

The two other bicycle riders corroborated that testimony, and it was they who noted the license number, make, and color of defendant's automobile. Defendant argued that he asked the first witness if he wanted to have the police called but that the first witness declined. One passenger in defendant's vehicle corroborated defendant's story, and another passenger did not testify because he was deported. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and the orders denying defendant's post-trial motions. Defendant made no showing as to the substance of the deported witness's testimony. Therefore, the State had no affirmative duty to ensure the continued availability of that witness, whose testimony would have been merely cumulative to that of defendant's other passenger.

The court affirmed, rejecting the wife's claim that &sect; 5(a) of the Act was unconstitutional. While the Act fixed limits upon the amounts to be recovered, the supreme court had previously sustained it as a legitimate exercise of the legislature's police power for the general welfare, in that it took away existing rights of action of employees while extending the liabilities of employers. Further, the Illinois courts had consistently refused to recognize a common law cause of action by children for the loss of companionship of a parent against a third person who negligently injured the parent. If that area of the law was to be expanded by recognizing such a cause of action, it had to be done by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Previously, the court held that the county's practice of retaining interest on the district's tax revenues violated Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 9(a). On remand, the trial court found that &sect; 280 of the Revenue Act of 1939 prospectively barred the district's claim and that the district was not entitled to retrospective relief. The district contended that if &sect; 280 was construed to permit the county's retention of the interest earned on the district's collected tax revenues, then &sect; 280 violated Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 9(a). The court observed that where a statute was subject to two constructions, one of which might render it unconstitutional, courts were bound to adopt the construction which avoided the constitutional problem. The court declined to construe &sect; 280 of the Act to authorize the challenged retention of interest because &sect; 280 would be unconstitutional if construed to authorize retention of interest earned on other public entities' collected tax revenues and because the plain language of &sect; 280 did not specifically authorize the practice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found defendant in contempt of court and fined her. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in finding her in contempt because of the vagueness of the trial court's rulings concerning what statements were prohibited and because she was entitled to make the statements and objections that resulted in the contempt order in order to properly represent her client. The court found that the trial court properly held defendant in direct contempt of court because she openly disobeyed the trial court's order. Defendant's actions were not only contemptuous of the trial court's rulings, but hindered the trial court in its attempt to conduct voir dire examination. Even if defendant believed the trial court's order to be improper, she was obliged to obey it. Defendant was clearly informed of what she was not to comment on before the prospective jurors; however, she constantly violated the order. The fine of $ 1,000 had to be reduced. The record did not disclose that defendant waived her right to a jury trial and therefore the trial court could not impose a fine exceeding $ 500. Furthermore, defendant's conduct was not so egregious as to warrant more than a minimum fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of murder and armed robbery. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing a tendered instruction on voluntary intoxication and in admitting into evidence allegedly prejudicial slides of the victim's body. He also argued that the armed robbery conviction had to be vacated because it was a lesser included offense of the murder conviction and that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing him to an extended term on the murder count. The court found that the trial court correctly disallowed defendant's tendered instruction because there was no evidence that his intoxication was so extreme as to suspend all reason or to render him incapable of acting knowingly. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the prejudicial value of the slides of the victim's body did not outweigh their probative value. The armed robbery conviction did not need to be vacated. The trial court entered a single conviction for murder on the jury's general verdict, and armed robbery was not a lesser-included offense. Any disparity between defendant's sentence and his brother's was justified on the basis of defendant's more active role in the crimes.</SPAN></P>

In seeking review of a tax assessment, the oil company attempted to have a lien imposed in lieu of posting a bond, pursuant to &sect; 12 of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, Ill. Rev.

The court held that the trial court properly denied the oil company's motion for lien in lieu of bond and granted the department's motion to dismiss. The trial court's exercise of discretion was allowed by Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the contract under which the buyers purchased the house was a rider that the seller would make certain additional repairs within 90 days. The seller failed to do so, and the buyer filed the instant action, but not until almost two years later. The court found for the seller, and the court affirmed, finding that the action was not brought within a reasonable time after the enactment of &sect; 13-214 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 13-214 (1981), which shortened the statute of limitations and effectively extinguished the buyer's claim. Even so, she still could have salvaged her claim if she had acted within a reasonable time, but the action was not filed for another nine months after the amendment. Under such circumstances, i.e., the buyer's long-standing knowledge of the defects and the seller's obvious unwillingness to perform, the buyer did not timely file the action, although she had time to do so. Further, &sect; 13-214 was constitutional because the classification in it bore a reasonable relation to its purposes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attorney general adopted comprehensive rules regulating the operation of buyers clubs. Plaintiff corporation's principal source of income was the sale of buyers club memberships, and it filed an action in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) for declaratory and injunctive relief against the rules. The corporation challenged the trial court's denial of its motion for summary judgment and grant of the attorney general's motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that the attorney general had no power to issue binding substantive rules and regulations under section 4 of the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, para. 264 (1981), and that the rules unconstitutionally impaired the obligation of contracts. The corporation also alleged that the Act unlawfully delegated legislative authority to the attorney general. The court held that section 4 conferred upon the attorney general valid legislative authority to promulgate binding substantive rules and regulations to eradicate deceptive and unfair business practices. The rules were properly promulgated and effectuated the objectives of the statute. The rules did not have to specifically exempt existing contracts because many of the rules logically could not be given retroactive effect. The rules did not apply to membership contracts entered into before the date the rules became effective. The attorney general was given no power to impose sanctions or to compel persons to cease using unfair or deceptive acts or practices. All relief had to be obtained through the courts. It was a valid delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor was charged with residential burglary. He was sentenced to confinement until age 21 under the Act. He claimed that the trial court improperly admitted testimony that he previously escaped from custody and testimony that he admitted that he had broken into the house previously. He also challenged the constitutionality of the Act. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment that he was delinquent and upheld the Act. The court held that there was no error in admitting the escape testimony because it raised a presumption of guilt of the crime charged, and that the confession was properly admitted as it showed his intent. The evidence of his guilt was so overwhelming as to render any error in admission of evidence of other crimes harmless. The Act did not encroach upon any exclusively judicial function as it did not declare the weight to be given evidence or say what evidence would be conclusive as to a factual issue. Finally, the fact that a minor could be treated as an adult in some cases but not in others, or that the Act might have permitted a juvenile offender to be confined longer than an adult habitual offender, did not violate equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

Defendant told the company that the drums in the cement trucks were not going to turn unless the union contract was signed. The trial court convicted defendant for intimidation. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court determined that the implication of defendant's statement was that the concrete would harden in the trucks, and repairs to those trucks would have to be made by the employer unless the contract was signed. The court ruled that defendant's statement was not protected by the national labor policy. The court also ruled that defendant's statement indicated an intent to act and had a reasonable tendency to coerce. Thus, the court held that the intimidation statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12--6 (1979), was not unconstitutional in its application. Lastly, the court ruled that the jury verdicts acquitting defendant of conspiracy and criminal damage to property and convicting defendant of intimidation were not inconsistent because the elements of intimidation differed from those of conspiracy and criminal damage to property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence at trial did not clearly favor one party over the other in the custody determination of the parties' two children. On appeal, the mother argued that the trial court abused its discretion by placing the children in the custody of their parents jointly and that the decision of the trial court to place the children in the physical custody of the father was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court reversed that part of the decision that granted joint custody to the parties, holding that it was an abuse of discretion to have awarded joint custody when the parties had an acrimonious relationship and could not have cooperated with each other. The court remanded the action to the trial court for a custody placement with one parent. The court affirmed the decision to place the children in the physical custody of the father because the decision was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court also held that the guardian ad litem's conduct in interviewing witnesses who did not testify at trial and then referring to facts not in evidence during his closing arguments was improper, however, because no objection was made at trial, the issue was waived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of joint custody was reversed, and the action was remanded to the trial court with instructions to place the children with either the father or the mother.

Stat. ch. 53, para. 71 (1977), and the trial court authorized attorney fees for the attorneys of the class. The trial court found that illegal fees collected pursuant to a joint accounting was $ 339,176, of which $ 106,141 was sequestered in a protest fund, and that the payment of attorney fees was limited to the amount in the fund. The court affirmed and held that attorney fees were properly limited to the amount of money in the protest fund. The lodestar computation for the services performed was correct. It was not an abuse of discretion to conclude that the balance in the fund was to be distributed pro rata to the members of the class. The trial court was aware of the fact that class members who did not exercise their right to reimbursement nonetheless received a benefit by virtue of their right to share the harvest of the lawsuit. It correctly ruled, however, that the fees could only be subtracted from the protest fund and that the benefit to the class was one of many factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought a review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus by which he sought release from the custody of the Illinois Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities, in which he was held pursuant to a court order that committed him following a finding that he was not guilty of murder by reason of insanity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was committed to the custody of the Illinois Department of Mental Health pursuant to &sect; 5-2-4(b) (Ill.

The court determined that defendant was legally in custody under an order entered under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 10-124(2) (1981), and that the trial court properly denied his release, when he had not sought a discharge from custody under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-2-4(1) (1981), which was applied to defendant. The court held that defendant's original commitment hearing satisfied the due process requirement of his commitment and the application of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 10-124(2) (1981) to defendant treated him equally with all other persons in his classification. The court further held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-2-4(b) (1977) was not applied retroactively to defendant.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, holding that the Act was constitutionally valid. The court concluded that the Act did not offend due process and was not overly broad or vague as applied to defendant because his conduct in diagnosing and treating people for diseases was clearly within the prescription of the Act. The court noted that defendant's attempt to introduce hypothetical scenarios in which the Act may have been unclear was unavailing because the Act's provisions could be considered only where defendant was directly affected. The court found defendant's claim that the Act prohibited application of simple home remedies to minor ailments unpersuasive because such conduct did not satisfy the elements of a violation. The court held that the Act did not prohibit speech because it applied to the practice of medicine. Even if the Act infringed on rights of expression, the court held, it was reasonably drawn to meet the state's compelling interest in regulation of the practice of medicine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that: (1) he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) his waiver of a trial by jury was invalid; (3) his right to cross-examine a State's witness was erroneously restricted; and (4) the trial court erred in entering judgments and imposing sentences for both armed robbery and armed violence. The court determined that the evidence, which was stipulated to by the parties in the absence of a transcript, showed that defendant participated in a robbery of a tavern with an accomplice during which the patrons and the bartender were threatened with serious bodily harm and that was sufficient to support his convictions for robbery and unlawful restraint, which were separate and distinct offenses. The court further held that defendant validly waived his right to a jury based on the trial court's disclosure that the trial court would determine the factual disputes, which defendant understood by his responses. The court finally held that defendant could not be convicted of both robbery and armed violence, which was an element of the proof required for the robbery and unlawful restraint convictions.</SPAN></P>

The jury found that the police officer reasonably believed the force used by him was necessary to prevent decedent's escape and the police officer reasonably believed decedent had committed or attempted to commit a forcible felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the police officer was chasing decedent, he fired two warning shots and then shot decedent when decedent refused to stop running. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the city and the police officer, and on appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 7-5(a) (1977) authorized the police officer to use such force when the police officer believed the force was necessary to prevent escape and the decedent had committed a forcible felony. The robbery victims told the officer that decedent threatened to shoot them and indicated that he was armed with a gun. The police officer observed decedent use force in a second robbery. Decedent refused to stop when the police officer ordered him to halt. Thus, the police officer acted under a reasonable belief that decedent might have used deadly force against another victim or the police officer. Decedent's criminal activity immediately prior to the shooting and testimony by the robbery victims were important to determine the reasonableness of the police officer's action. The counsel's comments that disputed the condition of decedent's leg and his ability to run were within the bounds of proper argument.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs filed a complaint for declaratory judgment seeking a declaration that Emergency Rule 4.14221 was void and violated federal notice requirements. The director contended the case was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to change the method of updating allowable reported health care costs for inflation, the director published Emergency Rule 4.1422. He later withdrew the rule. The circuit court held that plaintiffs' action was not moot, that Emergency Rule 4.14221 was valid, and that the Illinois Court of Claims was the proper court for plaintiffs' monetary claims. On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court; the withdrawal of the rule did not render the controversy moot. The issue of the emergency rule's validity required a determination for the plaintiffs' entitlement to monetary relief, which relief would cover the date of the rule's effectiveness until the date of its withdrawal. The court reversed the circuit court on the issue of the rule's validity; the court found no &quot;emergency&quot; that justified the enactment of the emergency rule. The court found unsupportable the director's assertion that the risk of losing federal matching funds created an emergency. The court found that the director failed to comply with federal regulations on notice and comment requirements. The court reversed the circuit court on the issue of the Court of Claims; the action was not against the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under its subdivision regulation ordinance, the village filed a motion to enjoin construction by a property owner of an apartment building outside of but within a short distance of the village's corporate limits. The trial court denied the village's motion. On appeal, the village contended that the trial court erred in denying the village's motion for preliminary injunctive relief. The court held that: (1) the law did not place a preliminary burden on a municipality to show developmental impact before enforcing subdivision regulations over contiguous territory; (2) Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-12-5(1) (1981) gave municipalities the right to exercise their police power over extraterritorial developments in the same way that they exercised that power over developments within their territory, in recognition that a municipality's concerns did not end at its borders; (3) a municipality needed not show irreparable injury to obtain either a temporary or preliminary injunction against the violation of its ordinances; and (4) a cross-appeal, in which the property owner argued that the village did not have jurisdiction over the development of land outside its borders, was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the action against the district on the ground that the cause of action was barred by &sect; 5-1(I) of the Snowmobile Registration and Safety Act, Ill.

The court first held that the injured individual lacked standing to complain of any unequal protection aspects of the statute because he did not pay valuable consideration for the use of the district's land. However, the court held that the statute was in violation of due process of law and could not have been reconciled with Illinois' philosophy of the nondestruction of remedies. The policy of the state was to promote safety for persons and property in and connected with the use, operation, and equipment of snowmobiles and the court noted that &sect; 5-1(I) of the Snowmobile Registration and Safety Act did not promote that policy. The statutory provision that provided absolute tort immunity was invalid as written.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 701 (1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to a clerical error in the county tax assessor's office, the taxpayer's property at issue was undertaxed for certain years. The taxpayer paid the taxes as assessed. Upon discovery of the error, the county officials began administrative back tax proceedings against the taxpayer . The taxpayer filed its action seeking injunctions. The trial court denied the county officials' motion to dismiss and granted a preliminary injunction. Finally, the trial court denied the taxpayer relief and required it to pay the back taxes, interest, and penalties. On appeal the court found that the taxpayer's property was not omitted property under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 701 (1979). If the taxpayer's property had not been assessed at all, it could have been assessed as omitted property. Because the taxpayer's property was assessed too low, due to the county officials' clerical error, and the taxpayer paid those taxes in full, the taxpayer could not be reassessed in subsequent years as having been omitted. The taxpayer could not be back taxed and the amount of the taxpayer's monies held in escrow had to be returned to the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 12-4-3, 33A-2 (1981). Defendant asserted that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-4(b)(8) (1981) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stabbed the victim at a place of public amusement. On appeal, defendant asserted that the statute under which he was convicted was void for vagueness and was overbroad as applied to the facts of his case. The court found that defendant only asserted that he was not given sufficient notice that a battery committed in an area of public amusement was an aggravated battery. The statute was not required to spell out every kind of public place to avoid being vague. In fact, defendant was given clear notice that his conduct was prohibited and could be prosecuted as a felony when committed in an area of public amusement. Also, defendant's acts committed within the victim's apartment clearly would not have been on offense under the statute, but punished more severely as home invasion. The statute was designed to deter harm to the public and no exception was necessary for criminal acts done in a place of public amusement near a private residence. Defendant failed to provide any support for an overbreadth argument. The prosecution conceded error in the calculation of defendant's time of imprisonment and the case was remanded for correction and otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The owners had nonqualifying properties within the village and attacked the ordinance's validity. The parties filed cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings. Judgment was entered for the village and the owners' appealed. The owners' contended that the ordinance was void because it placed the village in the insurance business in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 73, para. 733(1) (1981).The court concluded that the program was not established as an occupation for livelihood or gain for the village as its focus was on a governmental purpose. Further, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 72, para. 614(e) (1981) did not regulate local governmental activities.

On review, the court found that the board of review levied additional taxes without giving the taxpayers the opportunity to be heard, but that this did not deprive the taxpayers of procedural due process because they had opportunities to present their claims under available state remedies. The court took notice of the taxpayers' equal protection argument and agreed that the board of review purposefully and intentionally discriminated against commercial and industrial property owners by placing an increased financial burden on them but not on other classes of property owners.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted indecent liberties with a child and indecent solicitation. Defendant appealed. On appeal, defendant argued that the identification testimony was not clear and convincing because there were discrepancies in the boys' testimony with regard to their description of the man's clothing and the color of his eyes. The court held that the witnesses' in-court identification was sufficiently reliable to support defendant's conviction because their descriptions were reasonably accurate in view of their ages, and further, their photographic identification was sufficiently close in time to the incident to be reliable. Defendant further argued that his conviction for indecent solicitation should be vacated because it was based upon the same physical act as his conviction for attempt or was a lesser- included offense of attempt. The court held that the act of exposure alone, without the request for fellatio, would not have established the offense of attempt as a matter of law. Accordingly, the court vacated defendant's conviction for indecent solicitation and affirmed defendant's conviction of attempted indecent liberties with a child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant struck and kicked paramedics and a police officer who were trying to put him in an ambulance. Psychiatric examinations concluded that defendant was legally insane at the time of the alleged offenses because he substantially lacked the capacity to appreciate the criminality of his acts and was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. The trial court found that although defendant committed the acts charged, he was innocent by reason of insanity. After a hearing where one psychiatrist testified as to defendant's schizophrenia and another claimed he suffered from alcohol and drug abuse, the trial court committed defendant to a Department facility. On appeal, the court found that defendant's equal protection rights were not violated even though an insanity acquittee may be committed without being mentally ill and without a reasonable expectation that he would inflict serious physical harm in the near future, as was necessary for an involuntary nonacquittee. The court reasoned that insanity acquittees belonged to a special class of persons whose dangerousness had been demonstrated by the criminal acts committed, thereby justifying additional safeguards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff individual, a California resident, was injured in California and brought a personal injury action in Illinois against defendant companies, who were Illinois residents.

Plaintiff appealed and the court granted leave to appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the borrowing statute did not apply because defendants were Illinois residents, and the statute applied only when the parties were non-residents. The court also held the application of the borrowing statute to non-resident's only did not violate defendants' right to equal protection of the laws under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A borrower obtained a loan from the lender, and subsequently brought an action for usury when she realized that fees tacked onto the loan constituted interest that exceeded the maximum legal rate. The trial court found that the borrower demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the loan was usurious and that the lender received exactly that amount of interest which it sought. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court's ruling that the lender was not entitled to the bona fide error exception to the usury statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 74, para. 6 (1979), because the lender intentionally charged unlawful interest, was supported by the manifest weight of the evidence. The court also found that the trial court correctly calculated the borrower's damages by following the explicit language of the statute. Therefore, the trial court correctly doubled the amounts of all interest, discount, and charges assessed against the borrower, set off by the amounts of payments due and to become due. The court also rejected the lender's contention that the usury statute was unconstitutional. The court found that its provisions were clear, consistent, and unambiguous.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended on review that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The village asserted that the ordinance was constitutional, because it was based upon and copied from Ill. Rev.

The court reasoned that all courts, which considered the issue, held that the obscenity statute was valid and that there was no authority or justification, offered by defendant to mandate a complete reversal of the well-settled law. Further, the court found that the village correctly observed that the clear holdings of the Illinois Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Illinois obscenity act and the ordinance of the village. The court also found that the trial court, at the prosecutor's request, gave the jury, as the fact finder, instructions specifying that the prosecutor had to prove, that the &quot;obscene&quot; films shown were, also, in fact, utterly without redeeming social value. It was also found that the prosecutor did so prove as shown by the record. Thus, the court concluded that the record supported the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to &sect; 2-202-2(e)(1), a partnership was not subject to tax imposed by the Act but was to compute the base income as if it were an individual. However, the court found that the fact that the partnership computed its base income as if it were an individual had not meant that it had the correlative rights of an individual taxpayer. The court held that, once the partnership's income was ascertained, its existence was to be disregarded because each partner was to pay a tax on a portion of the total income. The court determined that the Department's administrative regulation enjoyed a presumption of validity and was not to be declared unconstitutional unless the classification was unreasonable. The court held that the taxpayer's were liable for their distributive shares under the partnership's total income. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant further argued that because the arrest being illegal, all evidence obtained subsequent thereto should have been suppressed. However, the court determined that the stop was a proper investigative stop because defendant had driven past a dumping area several times where the bodies were found and, further the aggregated and cumulative knowledge of several officers observing defendant's actions was sufficient. Defendant further argued that he was illegally taken into custody when he was handcuffed and transported to headquarters for questioning. However, the court held that the record was clear that defendant consented to it and then moments later the officers were informed by radio that the camper that he had been driving was stolen. Defendant further argued that since the jury was death qualified, it was not representational of the community and was conviction-prone. However, the court held that defendant had presented no evidence that the jury was prone to convict. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-4.1(a) (1981). Defendant sought review and contended that the statute allowing the trial by absentia was unconstitutional. The court held that defendant had the absolute right to be present at his trial and further found that such right could have only been waived by defendant himself. However, the court determined that defendant was not permitted to prevent his trial by voluntarily absenting himself. The court further held that defendant, who had been released on bail pending trial, had the duty to present himself when his case was reached on the jury calendar. The court also found that defendant had the duty to enable the trial court to notify him of the date of his trial. Because defendant failed to inform the trial court of his whereabouts, the court held that defendant waived his right to be present at his trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners and Cross-Respondents, a hauling corporation, brought a cause of action against respondent and cross-petitioner village. The village sought a rehearing for a review of an order of the Pollution Control Board. The village contended that the rights of the village and its citizens to litigate the issuance of landfill permits were a species of property protected by the Federal fourteenth amendment due process clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The villagers argued that the right to have an opportunity to present their case and have its merits fairly judged would not be circumscribed by the state, and that the due process right prevailed over the legislatively created necessity. On review, the court held that the village and its citizens had no underlying property right to be protected. The villagers had not been deprived of the right to litigate the matter, at most they had been forced to do so before a board which had an apparent conflict. The effect of the village's argument was to turn all statutory rights to a hearing, or to participation in a public hearing, into constitutionally protected property interests and then to make these hearings void if conducted by biased adjudicators. That bordered on a suggestion that the rule of necessity be abolished altogether.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that a motion for severance brought by one of them should have been granted, that it was error to admit codefendants' incriminating statements at the joint trial, that it was error to deny a motion to suppress police identification testimony, and that their extended-term sentences were improper. The court affirmed the convictions. The court explained that defendants jointly indicted were to be jointly tried unless fairness to one of the defendants requires a special trial to avoid prejudice. The court found no error in admitting codefendants' incriminating statements at the trial because the jury was properly instructed that the confessions of one defendant could not be considered as evidence of guilt of the others. The court concluded that there was no error in failing to suppress identification testimony, opining that the mere suggestion that the perpetrator of the crime was in the lineup was not unduly suggestive. The court found that &sect; 5-5-3.2(b)(2) of the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3.2(b)(2) (1985), which permitted extended-term sentences, was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's arrest on robbery charges, the victim identified him from a photographic array. At a subsequent lineup, where defendant was unrepresented and the photographs were allegedly shown to the victim during the lineup, the victim identified defendant as her attacker. During a motion to suppress the identification, defense counsel refused to submit a supporting affidavit required by Cook (Ill.) Cir. Ct., R.15.1 (e) on constitutional grounds, so the trial court summarily struck the motion. Defendant was then convicted of robbery at a bench trial. On appeal, the court held that the affidavit requirement was not unconstitutional because it only required a statement of facts which defendant's evidence on the motion would offer in any event. The court found that defendant's lack of lineup counsel, his attorney's failure to file the affidavit, and the dismissal of the motion without a hearing were all improper and that the lineup identification should have been suppressed. However, the court held that the conviction should stand because even had the motion to suppress been granted, there was sufficient evidence independent of the lineup identification to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state utilities company filed a proposed rate increase with the state utility commission, which suspended and then cancelled the increase. The utilities company moved for a temporary restraining order to restrain the enforcement of the commission's order, but the lower court denied the motion. The utilities company brought the matter before the court on interlocutory appeal. The court first considered the issue of jurisdiction, noting that ordinarily administrative remedies must be exhausted before a case may be considered by the courts. The utilities company acknowledged that it filed an application for rehearing before the commission after it resorted to the courts, but claimed an exception on the basis of irreparable harm it was suffering due to losses from its current confiscatory rates. The court rejected that argument because the commission would have to act on the utilities company's request for a rehearing within 20 days. The court also rejected the utilities company's argument that pursuit of administrative remedies would be patently useless. The court held that the lower court properly denied the temporary restraining order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county passed a resolution ascertaining the prevailing wages to be paid on public works projects by first inquiring into wage rates paid on both public and private construction projects. The union representatives objected to the county's method and claimed that the Prevailing Wage Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 39s-1 et seq. (1981), limited the inquiry to wages paid on public work projects. The lower court reversed the county's decision and directed it to ascertain the prevailing rate of wages by limiting its inquiry to wages paid on public works. The court affirmed and held that the phrase &quot;on public works&quot; &sect; 2 of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 39s-2 (1981), limited the inquiry in ascertaining the prevailing wage rate to only those wages paid on public projects. The Act was not arbitrary and did not violate due process or equal protection. That the Act could require contractors to pay higher wages on public works projects than they would on private works projects was no ground for invalidating the Act. The state had an interest in controlling the conditions under which public works projects were performed.</SPAN></P>

The village attorney stated that the trustee's qualification for office operated as a resignation of his employment as a police officer and the police chief confirmed the same. The trustee filed a complaint for declaratory judgment. The court held that the incompatibility rule did apply because there was a conflict of duties for the trustee. The village determined benefits for the police department and the police department had entered into collective bargaining agreements with the village.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician performed an elective vasectomy upon the husband in 1971. In June of 1980, his wife gave birth to twins. On review, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that &sect; 21.1 of the Limitations Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 21.1 (1981) barred causes of action based on alleged acts of malpractice that were filed over four years after the effective date of the statute. The court concluded that para. 21.1 was applicable because the patient and wife's claims for wrongful birth were treated as malpractice claims and applied even though they were only seeking economic losses rather than damages for personal injuries. The court found that the patient and wife's causes of action existed from the time of the alleged malpractice, which constituted a breach of contract and negligence. The fact that the wife became pregnant nine years after the vasectomy supported a finding that the cause of action might not have accrued until it had been barred by the statute of limitations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendants contended that &sect; 5-8-1(a)(1)(c) of the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-1(a)(1)(c) (1981), imposing mandatory natural life imprisonment was unconstitutional and that they were improperly convicted of both murder and armed violence. The court held that the sentencing authority must have the right to consider mitigating and aggravating factors, especially when there was no possibility of parole. The court found that the trial court had not considered mitigating or rehabilitative factors, and that the trial court followed the statute's mandate that upon the proof of two murders it was required to impose a natural life sentence. The court interpreted the word &quot;shall&quot; in &sect; 5-8-1(a)(1)(c) as permissive to avoid a holding that it was constitutionally invalid. The court concluded that the sentences of natural life should be vacated and remanded for further sentencing procedures as to the murder convictions. The court held that defendants were properly convicted of both armed violence and murder because the armed violence and the murder had not risen from a single act, but from a series of closely related or incidental acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility company was a public utility that provided sanitary sewer service for plaintiffs' county. The Illinois Pollution Control Board certified that the sewage treatment plants and related personal property were pollution control facilities. As a consequence of that certification, the sewage treatment facilities were required to be assessed by the Illinois Department of Revenue pursuant to &sect; 21a-3 of the Revenue Act of 1939, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 502a-3 (1981). The Department originally assessed those facilities at one-third of fair cash value. The Director was ordered to reassess the facilities, following a different lawsuit, and the utility company brought summary motions in the instant tax proceedings. The trial court granted summary judgments for the utility company, and plaintiffs sought review. The court affirmed, holding that para. 502a-3 was constitutional and that the utility company's facilities were not fully taxable under para. 502a-3 because they did not increase the production or reduce the production costs of the service of disposing of sewer waste. Also, land was properly considered a part of the pollution control facility situated upon it.</SPAN></P>

The court found that because appellants had not pursued their administrative remedies to challenge the action of the department, there was no factual basis for considering the lawfulness of classifying the taxpayer's property as personal property.

The court reasoned that the denial was irrational because in the first sentence the trooper was forbidden to engage in secondary employment as an owner, trainer, or driver of race horses, but in the last sentence of the order he was permitted to own race horses, but prohibited from training or driving the horses.

The court determined that plaintiffs' second amended compliant contained no such allegations. Further, the court noted that plaintiffs complained primarily of administrative errors. The court determined that a discretionary legislative decision, such as the passage of an ordinance, could be challenged on constitutional grounds only and, therefore, that plaintiffs' claims of administrative error were not cognizable.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the city had only that power to condemn land beyond its boundaries as was granted to it by the legislature, and the legislature limited that power by requiring that a referendum be held approving the acquisition of property for playground and recreation center purposes. Furthermore, the home-rule provisions of the state constitution did not give the city extraterritorial zoning powers. Only the legislature granted such authority.

Plaintiffs filed an action against the department for a refund. The trial court ruled that all of the amounts were assessed contrary to law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer alleged that the insured, after suffering an accident, made a claim and demanded arbitration. When interviewed the insured stated that the accident occurred when as a result of swerving to avoid another motor vehicle his car left the roadway and collided with a light pole. The insurer thereupon denied coverage since there was no contact with another motor vehicle. The insurance policy provided for arbitration, but only where the parties disagreed over whether the insured was legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle or the amount of such damages. Under this provision only questions of negligence and damages could be submitted to the arbitrator; thus, the court found that the question of whether or not the contact in question was arbitrable could not be submitted to arbitration. The court found that no real dispute had been raised by the pleadings because there was no allegation of the type of contract required for coverage. Thus, a judgment for the insurer was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs purchased a school building located in an area zoned for single-family residences. Plaintiffs made unsuccessful attempts to sell the property when the city refused to grant a variance from its zoning ordinance. Plaintiffs proposed to remodel the building for use as an office building, and they filed a declaratory judgment action against the city to have the zoning ordinance declared unconstitutional. The trial court entered judgment for plaintiffs. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, ruling that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the property. The court ruled that the ordinance was not substantially related to public health, safety or welfare because the property was near a commercial area; the property's value was significantly diminished by the zoning restriction; and the restriction did not promote public health, safety or welfare. Also, the property was ill-suited for the zoned purposes and had been vacant for most of the time since its purchase. The court also ruled that the proposed use of the property was reasonable. Thus, the zoning ordinance was properly ruled to be invalid as applied to the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, property owners and developers, filed a complaint against defendants, a county and its zoning officials, seeking an injunction, a declaratory judgment, and other relief on the grounds that an ordinance amending the zoning ordinance of the county was invalid. After a bench trial, the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) upheld the validity of the ordinance but granted the developers certain density rights, and all parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners, who owned a condominium airport project in an unincorporated area of the county, challenged an amendment to the zoning ordinance which restricted the number of individual hanger units that could be built. In upholding a judgment that the ordinance was valid, the court noted that the question was not one of suitability for use of the property as a restricted landing area, but its suitability for 276 or more aircraft. The court found that tripling the intensity of the subject property was a different use and not a continuation of an existing use. The owners were not entitled to further develop the nonconforming subject property to 276 hangars based on a special use permit, as there was no proof that a plan for a facility of the proposed intensity contemplated was ever submitted to or approved by the county. The court further found the order was in error to the extent that it would have permitted the property owners to use the subject property to base 155 planes thereon without applying for proper zoning. The proper number of planes would have to be determined by a review of the number of hangers built or under construction when the amending ordinance was adopted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that the ordinance amending the county's zoning ordinance was valid and enforceable, but modified the finding that the developers were able to increase the density of the property use without applying to the county for proper zoning, and found that an evidentiary hearing was required to determine the proper density.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the search warrant was constitutionally inadequate because there was nothing in the warrant that limited the scope of the property to be seized or to curtail the discretion of the officers in executing the warrant. The only guidance given to the officers who conducted the search was to seize &quot;items&quot; taken from a school and a grain company. Even if the inevitable discovery argument was not waived, there was no support in the record for the State's assertion that an inventory search of the car would have been made. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion for severance because the crimes were similar and defendant and his codefendant had items taken from both burglaries in their possession when arrested.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the residents of various suburban municipalities, appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted defendant utilities' motion to dismiss. The residents sought damages and declaratory and injunctive relief in their class action complaint alleging that the utilities collected unlawfully inflated municipal and state utility taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents alleged that the utilities misinterpreted &quot;gross receipts&quot; in their methods of computation. The residents claimed that gross receipts should include only those sums received by a utility from the customer to cover the utility service itself. The circuit court dismissed the allegations, and the appellate court affirmed. The appellate court rejected the residents' argument that the utilities' methods of computation resulted in the imposition of a tax on a tax in violation of due process. The municipal utility tax was an occupation tax imposed upon the utility. The additional charge passed on to the customer to offset that tax was not a tax on the customer, but rather an additional charge for utility service. The circuit court recognized that the utilities' practice of including in the municipal tax base the amounts collected to offset the municipal tax was declared impermissible, but dismissed the residents' allegation because the practice was being challenged in two pending class actions. The appellate court reversed and remanded; it found that the circuit court abused its discretion when it dismissed the allegations, which could leave the residents without a remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the order of the circuit court dismissing the residents' allegations as insufficient in law.

Defendants' motions to suppress evidence that had been taken from them by police officers following their warrantless arrests were denied. In a joint jury trial, defendants were convicted of unlawful delivery of more than 30 grams of a substance containing cocaine, and each was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. The court affirmed, holding that the circuit court reasonably denied the suppression of evidence seized, by police officers, from defendants' hotel rooms because there were exigent circumstances that justified the warrantless entry into the hotel rooms and defendants' subsequent arrests. The court further concluded that there was no basis for error in the circuit court's denial of defendants' motion for severance because the offenses with which defendants were charged clearly arose from the same comprehensive transaction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the insurance company was placed in liquidation by the state, attorneys were appointed to defend it, but the court denied their fee request, as well as payment for records on appeal. In reversing and remanding the case, the court held that the payment of reasonable fees, from company assets, was necessary and proper, and within the sound discretion of the trial court. As the failure to supply a record was a result of the erroneous decision to deny payment, the failure to provide a record did not require that the appeal be dismissed. As there were strong public policy considerations, a complete record was necessary to determine if the trial court erred in admitting certain business record exhibits and in admitting opinion evidence as to claims reserves without sufficient foundation of fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court signed the Director's proposed order, which provided that the agents could not bring the action because the contracts upon which the agents' claims were founded provided for binding arbitration and that the agents agreed that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because of the binding arbitration provision.

In affirming the trial court's order of dismissal, the court found that the agents' complaint failed to show on its face that all grievance procedures under the collective bargaining contract had been exhausted. Therefore, the agents' complaint was premature. The case was not yet ripe for a determination of whether the doctrine of sovereign immunity applied because it had not yet reached the stage at which sovereign immunity would be a viable defense.</SPAN></P>

It had also been farmed. The property owner submitted an application to the supervisor of assessments for the tract be valued under &sect; 20a-1 as real property used for agricultural purposes. The supervisor assessed the land as such, but the assessor did not agree and doubled the assessed value. The board affirmed the assessor's valuation. The property owner sought judicial review and the circuit court affirmed. Upon further review, the court reversed and remanded. The court concluded that the present use of the land determined whether it received an agricultural or nonagricultural valuation. Thus, the lands that were farmed and had not been sold as industrial development sites were used solely for the growing and harvesting of crops under Ill. Rev.

The employee was suspended for violation of a police department defining conduct that constituted neglect of duty.</SPAN></P>

The employee's commander observed the employee as he sat in the parked car and appeared to have been asleep. A rule of the rules and regulations of the Board proscribed conduct that constituted neglect of duty and defined sleeping, loafing, or being idle as such conduct. The employee appealed the suspension to the Board. The Board found that the evidence supported the three-day suspension. The trial court reversed, finding that although the factual findings were not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, the conduct did not evidence a substantial shortcoming that would justify a three-day suspension. The court reversed, holding that the trial court on administrative review erred by applying the &quot;substantial shortcoming&quot; test to the question of cause to suspend for three days. The court held that the proper standard of review was the arbitrary, unreasonable, or unrelated to the requirements of the service test. The Board's decision upholding the imposition of a three-day suspension against the employee was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or unrelated to the requirements of service.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the community center was not &quot;doing business&quot; or in the &quot;transaction of business&quot; in Illinois by advertising for a job in Illinois, hiring the injured party, or because it used a facility in Illinois to conduct staff interviews. The court also held that even if the community center was found to be doing business in Illinois, the injured party failed to meet the requirements of Ill. Rev.

The Board appealed the reversal of the civil penalty and the licensee challenged the suspension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to a finding that the licensee had violated Illinois Racing Board Harness Rule 21.19, the licensee requested a de novo hearing on the matter before the Illinois Racing Board. The Board issued a written order finding that plaintiff had violated the rule by failing to guard his horses. Subsequently, the licensee requested review by the circuit court. The circuit court determined that the stewards had no authority to impose a fine and remanded the issue to the Board for the determination of a fine, if necessary. The Board imposed a fine and suspension. The circuit court reversed the Board's fine. Reversing the decision of the circuit court and reinstating the fine, the court found that the Board's imposition of a fine was allowed under its authority vested in it by the Illinois Horse Racing Act. The court held that where there was a statutory grant of authority to an administrative agency, there was a corresponding grant of power to do whatever was reasonably necessary to exercise that authority. Furthermore, the court held that under the Illinois Horse Racing Act, the Board was bound by the action of the stewards in making its decision at the conclusion of a hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the order denying appellants' motion requesting permission to intervene in five applications for judgment and order of sale for delinquent taxes previously filed against the company, the court was required to determine whether the application for intervention was timely. A timely application to intervene was required whether intervention was permissive or a matter of right. The court found that the petition to intervene was filed the day uncontested motions for summary judgment were to be heard and approximately three-and-a-half years after the first of the underlying actions was filed. Counterbalancing this was the fact the county clerk failed to give appellants notice of the tax objection filings as required by statute. This, in part, was due to the fact that the company did not include one school district on its list of tax levying units in two of the underlying causes and failed to list either school district in two others. Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court determined that one school board became aware of a need to intervene after an application for a rehearing in another matter was denied. This was well before the petition was actually filed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was 13 years old at the time of the alleged crime. A public opinion survey demonstrated the pervasive effect of news coverage of the crime in the large metropolitan area. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to change venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The media disclosed that a companion of defendant, who was a suspect in the murder, was released from custody after he passed a lie detector test.

Additional peremptory challenges and challenges for cause were denied. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case with directions to grant a motion for a change of venue to a county outside the scope and orbit of the news media, ruling that defendant's right to an impartial trial was violated. Because the case was to be retried, the court also ruled, inter alia, that (1) the juvenile court did not lack jurisdiction to consider the state's motion to transfer the prosecution to adult court where defendant's mother, as a custodial parent, was properly served and had notice of the proceedings, despite lack of notice to defendant's noncustodial father; and (2) the trial court properly considered the statutory factors under Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were called before a grand jury that was investigating the disappearance of a person. Defendants were granted immunity under Ill. Rev.

The trial court found defendants in contempt and enforcement of the order of contempt was stayed pending appeal. The issues raised by defendants were: (1) whether the statutory scheme for granting immunity in Illinois to material witnesses was constitutional; and (2) whether defendants were properly held in contempt of court where the state made an oral, in-court denial of the witnesses' claims of illegal electronic surveillance. The court affirmed in part and concluded the Illinois statutory scheme provided for a grand jury witness to challenge evidence allegedly obtained through illegal electronic surveillance. The court held that it was entirely proper to assert the right not to answer questions based upon illegal surveillance. The court found that such an assertion was consistent with the intent of the Illinois eavesdropping statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and failure to yield to an emergency vehicle after being stopped by a police officer in relation to an apparent violation of a municipal ordinance prohibiting the making of a U-turn. The trial court dismissed the charges and the State appealed. The court found that the evidence established that defendant made a U-turn in an area where such turns were prohibited. The court held that the totality of the facts and circumstances known to the officer were sufficient to cause a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense had been committed and that defendant was the offender. The court noted that, even assuming the trial court correctly determined that the signs prohibiting U-turns were not posted properly, that fact alone did not support the quashing of defendant's arrest or the suppression of any evidence. In sum, the court held that the fact that the trial court may have determined, at least by implication, that the ordinance in question was defective or invalid did not render unconstitutional the officer's action in stopping defendant's vehicle to warn him of the prohibition against executing U-turns.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retailer of alcoholic liquor sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Peoria County (Illinois), which granted a motion to strike filed by defendants, the Illinois Liquor Control Commission and others. The order resulted in the dismissal of the retailer's complaint, which sought declaratory and injunctive relief in connection with the credit restrictions on the sale of beer set forth in &sect; 4 of art. VI of the Liquor Control Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retailer brought a declaratory judgment action in order to determine whether &sect; 4 of art. VI of the Liquor Control Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 43, para. 122 (1981), was violative of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the United States and Illinois Constitutions as well as &sect; 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1. The complaint further sought an order enjoining defendants from enforcing the statute on the basis of its invalidity. Defendants asserted that the matter had been previously determined in favor of the enactment and as to allegations of an antitrust violation, defendants asserted the defense of State action immunity. The court found that the issue of constitutionality decided by the trial court in allowing defendants' motion to strike was identical to those decided in a prior case. The motion to strike attacked the complaint's sufficiency as a matter of law based upon the previous decision of the Illinois Supreme Court, which dealt with the identical constitutional issues raised by the retailer. Its decision was persuasive and controlling. State immunity existed for the asserted violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.</SPAN></P>

The city moved for summary judgment. The trial court entered summary judgment for the city and denied the employee's motion to vacate. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was paralyzed during a gymnastics team practice session at school. The student filed an action for damages against defendants alleging negligent supervision, willful and wanton misconduct, and failure to supply adequate safety equipment. The court dismissed the claim of negligent supervision on the grounds that defendants were immune under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 24-24 (1977). The jury returned a verdict for the defendants on the remaining claims. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court and found that the trial court did not err in dismissing the negligence claim because the immunity supplied by &sect; 24-24 applied to non-disciplinary as well as disciplinary situations and to activities like gymnastics team practice not strictly required by the school program. The court found that the jury's verdict that the school board did not negligently fail to provide adequate safety equipment was not against the manifest weight of the evidence because there was evidence that the matting used was not defective, the thickness and type of mating used was the same as that used in competition, and that no additional matting would have prevented the injury.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial, ruling that the trial judge should have required the State to demonstrate under the facts and circumstances, that blacks were not being systematically excluded during voir dire solely because they were blacks. The trial court's failure to impose this requirement on the State was an error that required reversal of defendant's conviction and a new trial because defendant's right to a fair and impartial jury under the Sixth Amendment, including his right to a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community and the corresponding right not to have the State affirmatively frustrate that right, was violated.</SPAN></P>

In a contempt action brought by the State Attorney against appellants for letting several such NGRI's to escape, the trial court entered a temporary restraining order (TRO). The TRO held that appellants had violated the NGRI's constitutional rights and otherwise issued detailed instructions to appellants as to how to supervise NGRI's. On review the court held that the trial court had exceeded its jurisdictional authority for several reasons. First, the commitment statute gave the courts only limited authority over NGRI's once they were committed. Second, the TRO was actually a writ of mandamus and the trial court could not use mandamus to control the discretionary functions of appellants, as they were state agencies and personnel under the executive branch. Third, NGRI's had no recognized constitutional right to psychiatric treatment nor did the public have a right not to have NGRI's escape. Finally, what equity jurisdiction the court had could not be exercised unless appellant's conduct was grossly corrupt or abusive.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the temporary restraining order issued by the trial court and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens filed a lawsuit in the County and paid fees to file their lawsuits under the act. The citizens challenged the constitutionality of the act. The court affirmed the trial court's decision granting the County's motion to dismiss the citizens' lawsuit. The court determined that the citizens only had standing to challenge sections of the act that affected them. The court held that the citizens did not ask for leave to file an amended complaint after the trial court struck the complaint, so their cause of action depended on the sufficiency of the stricken pleading. The court held that the act was constitutional. The great difference in the size of the population of the County in relation to other Illinois counties provided a reasonable basis for requiring larger fees. It was reasonable to charge higher fees to probate larger estates because there was more work involved in probating larger estates. The fees were not taxes because they were optional. The fees would not have been incurred if the citizens were not seeking the services of the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action in the trial court, the voters sought disconnection of certain territory from appellant district and annexation of the territory to the voters' district. Appellants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was denied. The trial court ordered that the voters' proposition be submitted in an election. On appeal, the issue before the court was the sufficiency of the petition calling for the election in light of the election consolidation act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 46, para. 28-2 (1979). Specifically, appellants argued that the petition which the voters signed was valid only as to an election held on November 22, 1980, not the election date set by the trial court, or February 24, 1981. In affirming the trial court's order, the court held that appellants failed to take into account the language of the voters' petition that indicated that the November 22 date was a tentative one. The voters prayed in the alternative &quot;or such other time as the court may deem proper.&quot; The court found that the date for which the trial court rescheduled the election at its discretion, February 24, 1981, was consistent with the requirements of the election consolidation act.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs asked that an amendment to &quot;An Act to provide for the creation and management of forest preserve districts in counties having a population of less than 3,000,000&quot; be declared inapplicable to their sales contract and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act granted forest preserve districts the power to acquire land to fulfill the purposes for which the districts were established. However, an amendment to the Act required the City to consent before property could be purchased or condemned. The district and the property owner had engaged in negotiations for the sale of his property to the district prior to the amendment, but their contract was not executed until after the amendment's effective date. The City refused to consent to the sale. The City contended the trial court erred in finding that the amendment was inapplicable to the sale. The court agreed, overturning the trial court's judgment. The adoption of a resolution or the entering into negotiations to acquire land did not pass any interest in that land. Further, nothing in the amendment indicated a legislative intent that the statute should not apply to land acquisitions in which negotiations had been previously initiated. Since the property owner did not agree to sell his land until he executed the real estate contract, the Act required that the proposed sale receive the consent of the City prior to its consummation.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment against defendant and is remanded the case for a new hearing. The court held that the adjudication of delinquency had to be reversed under the facts of the case because defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court found that the joint representation of defendant and his co-defendants by a single public defender was a conflict of interest because the co-defendants' alibi defenses conflicted with defendant's testimony that placed them at the scene of the crime.

The court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the complaint and held that condominiums were not prohibited entirely under the city's zoning ordinance, and the practical effect of restricting condominiums to only condominium zones constituted an impermissible discrimination against the conversion of existing apartment dwellings into condominium units. A disparate treatment of condominiums and apartments was constitutional only if there was some basis for distinction. The court further held that the conversion of apartments into condominiums did not involve a change in the use of the property, but only a change in the ownership.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The survivor's deceased husband was killed at a construction project when an aerial platform collapsed. She filed a complaint for damages, as well as obtained a temporary restraining order allowing her access to the area for inspection and photography, and for preventing the removal of material from the area. The state seized the materials, however, and limited the survivor's access to them pending destructive testing. She sought a preliminary injunction that would prevent the state from removing the materials and conducting destructive testing. The lower court granted the orders. The court found that the principal issue was whether the lower court had jurisdiction to enjoin their investigatory activities. The court affirmed. Although the lower court erroneously found a lack of state investigatory authority, this did not necessarily require a finding that the relief granted was barred by sovereign immunity. The allegations, if proven, were sufficient to establish an abuse of authority by arbitrarily denying access to the material to be tested. This was sufficient to vest the trial court with the jurisdiction to enjoin any testing pending an evidentiary hearing on these allegations.</SPAN></P>

Defendants sought review of the trial court's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the state met its burden of proof because the poker game was the type of game of chance or skill that fell within the plain meaning of the activity proscribed by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 28-1(a)(1) (1979). The court also ruled that the fact that poker chips were used in lieu of cash did not diminish the fact that defendants played for money or other things of value as contemplated by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 28-1(a)(1) (1979). The court found further that sufficient evidence was presented at trial to permit the jury to find that the games were played for money or other thing of value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administrator filed an action under the Wrongful Death Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 70, para. 1 et seq. (1979), and the Probate Act of 1975, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110 1/2, para. 27 -- 6 (1979), alleging medical malpractice against defendants, physician and medical corporation. The administrator challenged a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed the complaint as time-barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was examined to discover the cause of an unidentified neurological ailment. When the tests were evaluated by the physician as normal, the decedent did not pursue further medical treatment. More than three years after he was allegedly misdiagnosed, the decedent was told he had incurable brain cancer. More than four years after the alleged misdiagnosis, the administrator brought this action. She argued that her action was not time-barred. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the statute of limitations barred the malpractice action because it was brought more than four years after the alleged negligent acts took place. Thus, because the statute of limitations barred the malpractice action, the Wrongful Death Act also precluded the administrator from bringing a wrongful death action for the same alleged malpractice. The complaint failed to state facts that would have estopped the physician and the medical corporation from asserting the limitations defense. Because the word &quot;physician&quot; as used in the statute of limitations included medical corporations, the administrator's argument that the statute did not apply to the corporation failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A victim, who was nine years old, put some hot dogs and water in a pan to cook. She heard a knock, opened the apartment door. Defendant then pushed the door open. He pushed her into a bedroom and tried to force his penis into her vagina and in her mouth. When she woke up, her body was severely burned, and the insides of her mouth and throat were swollen and bruised. The sole evidence of the cause of the severe body burns was the fact that the pan was found with only the hot dogs remaining beside her bed, and her sweater was wet. There was also swelling and irritation in her genitalia area. On appeal from defendant's conviction for rape, for devious sexual assault, and for heinous battery, the court held that: (1) whether or not boiling water was a caustic substance and could have caused the burns was not an issue for which expert opinion was admissible, but it was a question of law for the trial court; (2) boiling water was not a caustic substance within the heinous battery statute; and (3) although the State failed to prove an element of heinous battery, it proved beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the lesser-included offense of heinous battery, aggravated battery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed her claims against defendant former employer for employment discrimination in violation of &sect; 8.01a of the Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA) (counts I and II), &sect; 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (count III), and Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jurisdictional predicate for counts I and II, &sect; 8.01 of the FEPA, provided a remedy where the Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) failed to act in a timely manner. The court held that the trial court was correct in ruling that &sect; 8.01a of the FEPA was unconstitutional because its successor statute, &sect; 9-102(B) of the Illinois Human Rights Act, had been determined to be unconstitutional special legislation. However, the court reversed the trial court's dismissal of counts I and II because the former employee had a protected property interest in her employment discrimination claim, could not constitutionally be deprived of that interest by the inaction of the FEPC, and was entitled to amend her complaint to add the Department of Human Rights and the Human Rights Commission as defendants. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of counts III and IV on the grounds that they were time-barred because both the former employee's complaint and proposed amended complaint failed to sufficiently allege continuing violations on the former employer's part to avoid the time limitation and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend the complaint.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-74-1 et seq. (1981), as applied, was unconstitutional, and that the Open Meetings Act was violated.</SPAN></P>

On appeal of the judgment on the pleadings, the court affirmed. The court held that the business owners failed to argue the issue of equal protection as presented by their complaint, instead arguing a separate constitutional issue, that of &quot;public purpose,&quot; which had no basis in their complaint. Notwithstanding its holding that inquiry into the actual constitutional validity of the Act was thus unwarranted, the court held it could have been affirmatively shown that the Act was constitutional for the acquisition and construction of a food mart within the city. The business owners were capable of applying for municipal bond financing to improve their businesses, so the allegation that the Act denied them equal protection was groundless. The court found that defendants had entered into a tripartite agreement and enjoyed vested contract rights, which could have been unconstitutionally destroyed with the retroactive application of amendments to the Open Meetings Act.</SPAN></P>

The repairman filed a complaint for administrative review of the decision, and the trial court affirmed the denial. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the initial statement of scope and the definitions in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 147, para. 108.1 (1979), of the Weight and Measures Act, clearly put the repairman on notice that his activities connected with the installation of commercial weighing devices were subject to the authority of the department. The court concluded that the manner in which &quot;working knowledge&quot; was to be demonstrated was the type of task best left to the department instead of the general assembly. The court found no improper delegation of legislative power to the department and no failure of the general assembly to establish necessary standards. The court held that there was no constitutional infirmity with the use of the &quot;for cause&quot; standard in the statute.

The taking of property from the victim and the taking of the van were sufficiently separate acts for which defendant was properly charged with separate offenses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company manufactured and sold certain products at wholesale and retail. An auditor determined that the company improperly treated five retail sales as wholesale sales and that the company did not obtain the purchasers' registration or resale numbers. The Department issued a tax assessment, which the circuit court reversed. The Department appealed, and the court reversed, holding that the company was required to comply with &sect; 2c of the Act and that its failure to do so subjected it to the tax liability. The court found that &sect; 2c did not create a new tax on sales for resale and that as the matters embraced in &sect; 2c were germane and interrelated with the subject of the taxation of retail sales, the reference thereto did not expand the subject of the Act beyond the Act's title, and thus, Ill. Const. of 1870, art. IV, &sect; 13 was not violated. The court also found that the reporting requirements specified in the Act were reasonable as to the enforcement of the taxing scheme and that the company had not met its burden in proving a violation of Ill. Const. of 1970, art. IX, &sect; 2. The court concluded that the company was not entitled to a credit for use taxes paid to the Department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county filed complaints against the landowners in the nature of equitable bills for discovery and, thereafter, filed a motion for &quot;pre-pleading discovery.&quot; The landowners filed motions to dismiss, alleging that neither Ill.

R. 214 authorized the relief sought in the absence of the landowners' consent and, alternatively, that, if so construed, a violation of the landowners' constitutional rights would ensue. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss the complaint and granted the motion of the county for pre-pleading discovery pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 214. On appeal, the court vacated in part and affirmed in part. The court held that the part of the trial court's order allowing subsoil surveys without the landowners' consent was improper because such surveys were not authorized by either Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 4-503 (1981) nor Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 214.

The ordinance creating the Merit Commission, Section 58.1, Ill. Rev.

Rev. Stat. ch. 40, &sect; 510(b), as amended by Ill. Pub. Act 82-194, was unconstitutional as applied to respondent former husband and terminated the husband's obligation to pay the wife's insurance under a settlement agreement that was incorporated into their divorce decree because it was appropriate to do so in view of her remarriage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agreement provided that it was &quot;binding and conclusive&quot; and that the husband would continue to provide medical and hospitalization insurance for the wife. The husband contended that the wife's remarriage ended his obligation to continue to pay maintenance under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, &sect; 510(b), as amended. Reversing the trial court's order, the court held that the trial court did not have the power to dispense with the plain requirements of &sect; 510(b). The court found that the amendment to &sect; 510(b) was fully applicable to proceedings conducted before its effective date because the amendment was intended to clarify the legislature's original intent and that it applied on appeal because the legislature changed the law while the appeal was pending. The court ruled that the requirement of &sect; 502(f) of the IMDMA that an agreement precluding modification of maintenance payments had to be expressed in the settlement agreement should be relaxed because the agreement was made prior to the effective date of the IMDMA and remanded for evidentiary hearings as to whether the parties intended that the recital that the agreement was &quot;binding and conclusive&quot; would bar subsequent modification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowner appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Fulton County (Illinois), which allowed the motion to dismiss of defendant city. The complaint for negligence, trespass to land, and an unconstitutional taking of land for public use was dismissed with prejudice on the grounds that the counts failed to state a cause of action and that they were barred by the applicable limitations periods.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1974, a heavy rainstorm washed away the homeowner's gravel driveway as a proximate result of the city's municipal improvements, made in 1969 or 1970, which increased the quantity and force of water through an underground culvert. The city partially paid for the repairs to the driveway. Subsequent municipal improvements increased the amount and force of water propelled through the culvert and again washed away the driveway in June 1980. On appeal, the court held that the appropriate limitations period was the two-year period found in the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para. 8 -- 101 (1979). The city alleged that the period began running in 1969 or 1970 when the homeowner had notice of his first injury. The court found that where a tort involved repeated injury, the statute of limitations in Illinois began to run from the date of the last injury or when the tortious acts ceased. Thus, the homeowner's complaint was not time-barred. The court reversed the circuit court on counts I and II, but affirmed on count III because the injuries were infrequent and impermanent in nature and did not constitute a &quot;taking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's dismissal of count III of the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, reversed the dismissal of counts I and II of the complaint because they sufficiently alleged causes of action and were not barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Although defendant's fingerprints were not found at the crime scene, defendant was convicted on charges of murder and armed robbery. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentences. The court held that defendant was not denied a fair trial in connection with the selection of his jury because: (1) it was proper under the Sixth Amendment for the state to exclude jurors for automatic opposition to the death penalty; and (2) the state was entitled to use its peremptory challenges to exclude black jurors, and defendant failed to meet his burden of overcoming the presumption that the state used its challenges to obtain a fair and impartial jury.

Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(e) (1981). Defendant was properly sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder charge under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-1 (1981), because murder in the course of an armed robbery was an aggravating factor under the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bail payors appealed the judgments of the Circuit Courts of Du Page and Lake Counties (Illinois), which held that defendants, clerks of court, county, and county treasurer, did not violate Ill. Const. of 1970 art. VII, &sect; 9(a) by retaining 10 percent of the bail bonds that the payors deposited with the clerks of court. Two actions from separate counties were consolidated for consideration by the court.</SPAN></P>

One payor's underlying case had not been resolved, but the underlying cases of the remaining payors had been terminated. The lower courts held that the retention of a percentage of bail bonds did not violate Ill. Const. of 1970 art. VII, &sect; 9(a), and the court affirmed. The court held that the payors whose underlying cases had been resolved could not collaterally attack the judgments entered in their cases and were foreclosed from challenging the constitutionality of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 110-7(f) (1979). The court ruled that because the clerks were acting administratively on behalf of the judicial branch of the state government and the retained fees were deposited with the treasurer, Ill. Const. of 1970 art. VII, &sect; 9(a) did not prohibit the retention of the fees. Section 9(a) only prohibited local units of governments from collecting fees that were used to fund their own units of government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged an order from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found them both guilty of voluntary manslaughter. On appeal, one defendant, who was represented by court-appointed counsel, asserted that he was wrongly denied free investigative services under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 113-3 (1979).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge denied one defendant's motion for a state-paid investigator. Defendant claimed that he was denied equal protection because an indigent defendant represented by the Public Defender's Office had access to free investigative services, but one represented by court-appointed counsel did not. Thereafter, a different trial judge found both defendants guilty of voluntary manslaughter, where one defendant was guilty based on accountability. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions, holding that defendant failed to establish a need for an investigator to locate unknown witness who may have seen the fight between the victim and defendants. Specifically, the court held that a claim that other possible occurrence witnesses, in addition to the 50 to 100 present, would have helped defendant's self-defense theory was speculative. The court also found no provision for investigative services in the compensation statute. The court rejected the other defendant's contention that he was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt for the manslaughter. The court noted that his conviction was based upon an accountability theory and not voluntary manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged by information with having committed an unlawful calculated criminal drug conspiracy, with unlawful manufacture of a controlled substance and with unlawful possession with intent to manufacture a controlled substance, in violation of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, 1979 Ill. Comp. Stat. 56 1/2-1100 et seq. (Act). The unlawful substance was psilocyn, which was found in Psilocybe mushrooms seized from one of defendants. The trial court granted a motion to dismiss the informations. The trial court found that the act violated defendants' due process rights as applied to the possession of Psilocybe mushrooms, because it did not specify which types of mushrooms were prohibited and because it did not specifically proscribe possession of the mushrooms themselves, as opposed to the extracted psilocyn. The court reversed and found that the trial court and defendants' construction of the act was improper and that the act was constitutional. In particular the court found that the legislature meant, and did, prohibit possession of mushrooms, which, in their natural state, contain psilocyn.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Originally, the school district brought a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the homestead exemption created by the Revenue Act of 1939, Ill.

However, the Supreme Court of Illinois remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings with regard to the billing and collection of taxes for both 1979 and 1980. After the case was remanded, the school districts cross-appealed the trial court's denial of the school districts request for affirmative relief and sought a modification of the trial court's order so that defendants would be required to take some affirmative action with respect to the billing and collection of 1979 taxes still owing due to erroneously granted exceptions. On appeal for a second time from the trial court, the court held that the trial court correctly refused to grant defendants' request to make final the 1979 taxes and that the appropriate manner in which to carry out the supreme court's mandate to ascertain those taxpayers who were not entitled to the general homestead exemption and to bill them for the balance due on the 1979 taxes was to send out questionnaires as outlined by the court.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the State presented sufficient evidence that defendant wilfully avoided trial because the State's attorney stated that his office had contacted all of the local hospitals and that the sheriff's department also attempted to locate defendant. The court explained that the notice to defendant that his trial could have been conducted in his absence was a notice that the entire trial, including the sentencing hearing, could have been conducted in his absence. The court noted that defendant waived his right to object to any deficiencies in his presentence report because there was no indication that he objected to any alleged deficiencies in the report when it was tendered to the trial court, and he failed to attend an interview with a probation officer before completion of the report.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Illinois Securities Law (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, paras. 137.1-137.19, plaintiff filed complaints for statutory injunction and for a temporary restraining order. At the hearing, it was established that defendants were not registered under the Act as issuers, dealers or salespersons of securities or as investment advisors. Defendants testified that they were engaged in the business of selling insurance and did some estate planning involving life insurance. Defendants denied ever telling their clients that they were investing in tax-free bonds, bonds or any security. The trial court issued a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order. On appeal, the court found that the defendants could appeal a denial of the motion to vacate, but not the temporary restraining order. Since no motion to vacate was filed, the court declined to consider the propriety of the temporary restraining order. The court determined that plaintiff's evidence supported findings that defendants violated provisions of the Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physicians were nine doctors who had attended a particular medical school in Puerto Rico. Each physician had been accepted into a residency program at a Chicago area hospital including the residency program of defendant hospital. Participation in the residency programs was contingent upon the physicians' ability to obtain temporary certificates of registration from the Department. The physicians' applications for certificates were denied, and the physicians brought an action against the hospital and the Department for administrative review, declaratory relief, and a preliminary injunction. The trial court denied the physicians any relief, and the physicians appealed. The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the court held that the inequality of the retroactive application of the Department's rules far exceeded the state's interest in denying the physicians the opportunity to pursue their medical careers.</SPAN></P>

Upon appeal, the court affirmed the rape conviction and reversed the armed violence conviction. The court held that Illinois rape shield statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-7 (1979) was not unconstitutional as applied to him as the limitation placed on defendant's cross-examination of complainant did not infringe upon his right of confrontation as there was nothing in the complainant's arrest record to impeach her testimony conclusively. The Illinois rape shield statute was not an unconstitutional legislative infringement on the powers of the judiciary. The court found that a letter alleged to have been written by defendant to the complainant was properly admitted as it appeared to come from defendant's cell and that the letter contained information that was known to the defendant. The evidence of defendant's guilt was not so closely balanced, and the remarks of the prosecutor noted in defendant's brief were not so prejudicial, as to prompt this court to invoke the plain error doctrine. The court held that the commission of the rape while armed was a single physical act which did not support dual convictions.</SPAN></P>

At no time before or after trial did defendant's counsel object to trial in absentia. The court reversed, finding that it was plain error to try defendant in absentia. Although defendant had been sent two notices of his trial date, they were not sent by certified mail as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-4.1(a). The trial court could proceed in defendant's absence only where the State had made the request and proven by substantial evidence that he was wilfully avoiding trial.

The taxpayers filed an objection seeking to have the certificates of error granted and a refund made to them. The trial court dismissed the taxpayers' objection because they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies or pay the subject taxes under protest, a prerequisite to maintaining a specific objection. On appeal, the court held that the trial court had discretion under Ill. Rev.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that while &sect; 12-4.26 expressly permitted the powers of termination and suspension to operate retroactively, there was no suggestion that it was intended to apply to the recovery of funds that were improperly paid before the effective date of the Code. Further, the court found that common law did not confer power upon the department to recoup payments through administrative proceedings because the department was an agency that was created by statute, and, therefore, it only had powers that were expressly granted by the statute that created it. The court held that the appropriate method for the department to recoup the payments was the filing of a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Code Corr., Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-6-1(c) (1981) and sentenced her to six months' misdemeanor probation. In a bench trial, defendant was found guilty of committing a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue presented for review was whether a person charged with a misdemeanor and found guilty after a bench trial was eligible for supervision under &sect; 5-6-1(c). The State argued that &sect; 5-6-1(c) meant that supervision could only be ordered upon a guilty plea or a stipulation by a defendant of: (a) the facts supporting a charge or (b) a finding of guilt. Defendant argued that supervision was proper upon a guilty plea, or a stipulation by a defendant of the facts supporting a charge, or a finding of guilt. The court vacated the judgment and found that the statute was ambiguous and relied upon statutory interpretation to conclude that the legislature intended to produce a bill that permitted supervision in cases where a defendant had not pled guilty, but instead had been found guilty. The court further concluded that the term &quot;finding of guilt&quot; used in the statute was broad enough to include adjudications of guilt by a judge or jury. The court observed that the trial court erroneously denied supervision in the belief it was required to do so based on a case in the Appellate Court of Illinois, Fourth District that was not binding in the First District.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated battery and unlawful restraint. The trial court sentenced him to a term of 12 months' periodic imprisonment. The state subsequently filed a petition alleging that defendant had violated certain conditions of his periodic imprisonment. Following a hearing, the trial court revoked defendant's periodic imprisonment and imposed extended-term sentences. On appeal, the court vacated the sentences. The court noted that under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-2(b) (1981), a defendant who pleaded guilty to a charge and who was eligible for an extended-term sentence was entitled to notice that he could be sentenced under the extended term statute and, if no such notice was provided, an extended term-sentence could not be imposed unless the defendant was first given an opportunity to withdraw his plea. The court determined that defendant was not given such notice and, therefore, that his sentences could not stand. The court declined to review defendant's claim that the underlying pleas were not knowingly and voluntarily entered, concluding that the issue was not cognizable on an appeal from an order of revocation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, three city police officers who were discharged by defendant personnel board for violating a city residency requirement, challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance establishing the requirement. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) reversed the personnel board's decisions discharging the officers, holding the ordinance to be unconstitutionally vague. The personnel board sought review of that ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A municipal code provided that all officers and employees in classified civil service were required to be actual residents of the municipality, and that any officer or employee who failed to comply with the ordinance would be discharged in the manner provided by law. Police officers who were legally separated from their wives, but owned in joint tenancy homes outside of the city, were discharged, although they rented apartments and were registered to vote in the municipality. On appeal from judgment in favor of the police officers, the court held that the purpose of requiring police officers to live in the city did not prevent a police officer from maintaining a second home outside the city. Further, the court held that the ordinance establishing the residency requirement was unconstitutionally vague because it lacked enforceable standards. Additionally, it was applied in such a way as to violate the police officers' right to due process of law. However, the trial court's refusal to grant the police officers' attorney fees was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment reversing the personnel board's discharge of the three police officers, holding that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it lacked definite standards for equitable enforcement, and, alternatively, that the ordinance was unconstitutionally applied to the officers. The cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Appellee owners cross-appealed, alleging that the judgment which awarded interest at six percent denied them fair compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department contended that the property remained the same before and after the taking of the easement and construction of the overpass, with no change in access to the adjoining street, Old Route 51, and that the owners suffered no compensable injury when the flow of traffic was diverted to a new location, new Route 51. The court rejected the Department's argument that mere circuitry of travel, shared by the public generally, resulted from the relocation of part of Route 51 and that the decrease in the value of the property was therefore not compensable. But the court found that the trial court erred in denying the Department's motion to strike the testimony of an expert whose testimony was based in part on elements which included damages suffered by the public at large, and in the instructions to the jury. In their cross-appeal, the owners challenged the adequacy of the interest awarded for the delay between the taking and the payment of final compensation. The court held that the statutory rate of six percent was not subject to constitutional challenge as it was applied to the interest paid by the Department on that part of the judgment representing damage to land not taken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the award below for damage to land not taken after a quick-take easement, and remanded the cause for a new trial on damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated cases, appellant property owners sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed counts I, III, IV, and V of one of their complaints against appellees, the county assessor and the county treasurer (county), in which they challenged certain tax assessments and collections. The county challenged the issuance of a preliminary injunction by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners' challenge to the county's assessment and collection of taxes arose from the application of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, paras. 501a-1 to 501a-3 (1981) in the county's assessment of land used for agricultural purposes. The property owners alleged that the taxation of their property was controlled by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 501e (1981). The county challenged the trial court's jurisdiction to issue a preliminary injunction on grounds that a remedy at law existed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The trial court had the jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction because the property owners alleged that the county's taxation of their land was &quot;unauthorized by law.&quot; Where the authority of the county to tax was questioned, the trial court had equity jurisdiction. Counts I, III, IV, and V of one of the complaints were properly dismissed by the trial court because in those counts, the property owners challenged the validity of the tax as assessed, and did not question the county's authority to tax. In the dismissed counts, the property owners were not entitled to declaratory relief or injunctive relief from the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court to grant a preliminary injunction in favor of the property owners to enjoin the county from distributing the taxes collected from the property owners and to dismiss counts I, III, IV, and V of one of the property owners' complaints.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustees sold certain property that had been held by the prior corporation.

For Federal income tax purposes, the trustees reported a long-term capital gain of $ 3,560,093.53. The trustees also included this gain on its Illinois income tax return. The trustees filed a claim for refund for overpayment of its Illinois income taxes with the Department. They argued that without the valuation limitation deduction, the Illinois income tax, as applied to corporations, was an unconstitutional retroactive tax because it taxed corporate income realized from the sale of property that appreciated in value prior to the effective date of the Income Tax Act. The court upheld the Department's denial of the trustees' refund and held that a taxing act was not retroactive when it taxed gain or profit realized by the sale of property subsequent to the effective date of the income tax law, regardless of when the property sold increased in value.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected the husband's argument that there was a presumption that the child of a married woman was legitimate because the presumption was overcome by evidence of the husband's vasectomy and the mother's sexual relations with other men. The court found no evidence of an alleged agreement between the mother and her husband regarding &quot;surrogate insemination&quot; by men other than the husband, so that the mother could conceive a child.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of armed violence, based on the underlying felony of voluntary manslaughter, after a jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that he was not justified in shooting the victim. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised several grounds of error. The court rejected each claim and affirmed his conviction. The court held that the jury's initial silence on the armed violence charge did not constitute an acquittal, and that the subsequent finding of guilty was not coerced. The court held that when the jury returned a partial verdict before it was discharged, its silence on the remaining counts was not an acquittal and that ordering the jury to return verdicts on each offense charged was not double jeopardy. The court also upheld the lower court's refusal to give a proposed cautionary instruction regarding the credibility of the state's main witness who was a drug addict. The court found that such an instruction would have invaded the province of the jury and that it was unnecessary in light of this witness' admission that she had vacillated in pretrial statements on whether she saw defendant shoot the victim. Although the court held that the lower court erred in precluding cross examination of this same state's witness regarding a prior conviction, the court held that the error was harmless because the jury was aware that this witness violated laws daily by her admitted drug use.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that venue in Rock Island County, the place where an act in furtherance of the offense occurred, was proper. The fact that defendant was unaware of the original plot and had never set foot in Rock Island County was immaterial. He was vicariously liable for all acts done by any other parties to the conspiracy already composed, either before or after his entrance into the conspiracy, as long as such acts were in furtherance of the conspiracy. The court held that a calculated criminal drug conspiracy was an inchoate offense, and could be tried in any county where an act, which was an element of the offense was committed, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1-6(m) (1979). However, the court vacated the reimbursement order and remanded the cause as to the issue of reimbursement to the county for the costs of appointed counsel from defendant's bail bond because the record did not contain a finding by the trial court that defendant was or was not indigent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a passenger in a car with a rear license plate obstructed by dirt, so a police officer stopped the car. Identification of the driver was confusing, but the officer noticed a bottle of champagne or wine on the passenger side floor and asked the driver and defendant to exit the vehicle. Upon exit, the officer observed defendant try to throw an object under the car, which was a baggie containing a white powdery substance. Subsequently, he searched the car and found other drug paraphernalia. Defendant made a motion to suppress this evidence, which was denied. He was convicted and appealed. The court held that the officer had a legitimate concern for his safety in asking defendant to step out of the car. The order to exit was a de minimis intrusion into defendant's personal liberty and did not amount to an arrest. The arrest occurred after the officer observed defendant's attempt to dispose of the baggie. The subsequent search was lawful, and the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress. The evidence, which was properly admitted, clearly established that defendant had knowledge and constructive possession of cocaine to form the basis of his conviction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was found guilty of charges related to the crime. The court reversed the judgment and held that the statement made by defendant was improperly admitted into evidence because defendant asserted his right to remain silent prior to his query about seeing a co-defendant and the police practices employed constituted a continuing interrogation. The record showed that defendant had asserted his right to remain silent, was asked by the police if he wanted to see co-defendants who were &quot;squealing&quot; on him, threatened a co-defendant, asked what crime he was charged with, and responded by saying &quot;I should have killed him.&quot; Under the circumstances, defendant's statement was neither spontaneous nor voluntary.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 36, para. 17 (1979), and the Illinois Public Funds Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para. 902 (1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Treasurers Act provided that earnings on investments had to paid into the County Treasury for county purposes, except where statutes directed payment to particular funds. All earnings accruing on investments made under the Public Funds Act had to be credited to the agency for which they were made. Reversing, the court said that under section 2 of the Public Funds Act, the District was entitled to the interest. Retention of interest on the District's tax revenues by the County under the Treasurers Act violated Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 9(a). Section 6.1 of the Treasurers Act was not intended to include the interest earned on funds owned by other local government units. If the practice had been permitted, the Treasurers Act would have been unconstitutional. Compensating counties for the cost of collecting taxes due other units appeared to be a rational basis for the classification, but Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 9(a), against such compensation, weighed decisively against upholding the unequal treatment of counties and other units. The challenged classification was no more than an arbitrary and unjustified preference for counties as against other units.</SPAN></P>

Defendant maintained that the trial court improperly failed to conduct a hearing on his pro se motion for substitution of judges. The court determined that none of the allegations were sufficient. Defendant contended that his right to a fair trial was denied because he was forced to trial, before a judge against whom he had filed a &sect; 1983 lawsuit; however the court noted that the suit was never filed and held that the argument was meritless. Defendant argued that he was unconstitutionally penalized for going to trial. The court held defendant failed to show his sentence was a punishment for exercising his right to go to trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant gave an undercover agent two tablets of alleged pharmaceutical speed. When he was convicted of violating section 404 of the Controlled Substances Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1404 (1979), he appealed. Affirming, the court said that the prosecution sustained its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had represented the substance that he delivered to the agent as a controlled substance. Amended sentencing classifications satisfied the requirements of due process. The amended sentencing scheme did not conflict with the Act to such a degree as to constitute an arbitrary or capricious classification. Only &sect; 401(e) and (f) offenses, which involved the delivery of less dangerous schedule IV or V controlled substances, were made Class 3 felonies. The disparity between the potential fines for &sect; 404 offenses and &sect; 401(e) or (f) offenses did not rise to constitutional dimensions. By increasing the punishment for &sect; 401(e) and (f) offenses to Class 3 felonies, but not disturbing the &sect; 404 classification, the Act found that the delivery of look-alike drugs was as harmful as the delivery of schedule IV or V controlled substances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An implied consent hearing was held after defendant's arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol to determine whether defendant's driver's license should be suspended for refusing to submit to a breathalyzer test. The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground that the arresting officer's affidavit was insufficient to comply with Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501.1(d) (1979) because it failed to state facts which showed that defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The court determined that an implied consent proceeding was appealable in the same manner as other civil proceedings. The court found that the trial judge reasoned incorrectly in dismissing the proceedings because the affidavit literally complied with para. 11-501.1(d). The court agreed that the affidavit was insufficient, but the insufficiency was due to its failure to comport with the requirements of the Fourth and Fifteenth Amendments. While defendant's driving conduct might have suggested other vehicular violations, it was deficient, standing alone, to support a conclusion that he was driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted her of possession of a controlled substance and delivery of a controlled substance. Defendant contended that &sect; 4.1 of the Dangerous Drug Abuse Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91 1/2, para. 120.4-1 (1977), which permitted certain members of a state drug commission to delegate representatives to serve in their places, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession and delivery charges related to the drug pentazocine. She appealed and maintained that the Act impermissibly allowed members of the commission to delegate representatives to serve in their place by written notice to the drug commission and asserted that such was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers because no standards were provided for the selection of the representatives. Upon review, the court determined that of the 11 members specifically designated by the Act, only four were present when the commission added pentazocine to the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1100 et seq. (1977). The seven members that were authorized to delegate representatives did so. The court determined that the legislature, in giving the power to delegate a representative, intended that the power could be utilized by the representatives in situations involving whether or not to add, delete, or reschedule a controlled substance. The court held that representatives who participated in the decision to control pentazocine were guided by the same intelligible standards that applied to the authority of regular members.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 1003 (1978). The court had initially remanded the case for determination of the class certification issue before any judgment on the merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 1003 was enacted in response to a successful attack on a prior existing statute, which provided that the net proceeds from a sale by the recorder of deeds or registrar of titles would be treated as a &quot;fee.&quot; Section 1003 permitted the recorders and registrars to retain 50 percent of the tax collected by them as a &quot;distribution of the tax.&quot; The taxpayers challenged the new statute. The trial court dismissed the action, but the court reversed. The court initially directed the trial court to first determine the propriety of class certification, but the Illinois Supreme Court remanded the case to the court for an analysis on the merits. The court reversed and remanded. The court determined that the effect of &sect; 1003 was to make cosmetic rather than the necessary substantive changes. The court concluded that the retention of the funds by the county officer for his role in the collection of state monies was a violation of the constitutional prohibition against fee offices in Ill. Const. of 1970, art. VII, &sect; 9(a).The court remanded the case for a determination of the propriety of class certification and to sustain the illegality of the collections under &sect; 1003.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge who presided over defendant's trial had a practice of presiding over all criminal trials in the county in which the lower court was located.

The lower court, relying on the practice of the judge to hear all criminal cases, denied defendant's motion for substitution, and defendant was convicted of armed violence and intimidation. The court reversed, holding that the right to substitute judges at criminal trials was to be liberally applied in defendant's favor and that defendant had properly exercised his right of substitution.

The trial court sustained the mother's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The father appealed. The court reversed and remanded for further proceedings, holding that the Paternity Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 40, para. 1351 et seq.

The court first held that the order appealed from constituted a final appealable judgment under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 301. The court then reversed the trial court's order and remanded the case. Suspension shall occur under para. 11-501.1(d) only if either the arrestee fails to request a hearing or upon termination of such a hearing if that be the decision of the trial court. Hence the officer's warning that refusal to submit to the breath tests &quot;may&quot; result in suspension of the driver's license was in accord with other statutory provisions. Moreover, the implied consent law was not unconstitutionally vague and indefinite, nor was it an unlawful delegation of authority to the Secretary of State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed an action against the county assessor and other parties to enjoin assessment, levy, and collection of back taxes for three prior years on the taxpayer's leasehold. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court authorized a reduction in back taxes for the taxpayer, enjoined collection of statutory interest for three prior years, and ordered the taxpayer to pay back taxes for two prior years. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the trial court did not err by enjoining the collection of interest on the property taxes pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, paras. 701, 705 (1973). The court held that the taxpayer should not be required to pay an interest penalty on taxes that had been paid under an unconstitutional statute. The court upheld the trial court's ruling that it would be inequitable to impose an interest penalty on the taxpayer for late payment of taxes. The court noted that the unconstitutionality of the &quot;use tax&quot; was irrelevant as to whether the property could be reassessed. The court held that because the property had been assessed and valued, the taxes could not be increased through a revaluation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant testified that he lived in the house where the illegal transaction took place for less than two months. Defendant contended that: (1) the information by which he was charged was fatally defective because it alleged his unlawful delivery of cocaine; (2) a new trial should have been granted due to the ineffective representation of his retained trial counsel; and (3) the minimum sentence imposed deprived him of due process of law. On appeal, the court determined that defendant was properly charged with a violation of &sect; 401(a)(2) of the Controlled Substance Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1401(a)(2) (1979), under which it was unlawful to deliver 30 grams or more of cocaine. The court held that a new trial was not warranted due to alleged incompetence of defendant's trial counsel when the evidence of guilt was such that there could be little effective defense. The court noted that defendant admitted in his testimony that he had sold LSD on one prior occasion. As to defendant's argument that the minimum sentence imposed deprived him of due process of law, the court determined that cocaine was classified with &quot;true&quot; narcotic substances for the purpose of penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensees were suspended for failure to comply with the Ambulatory Surgical Treatment Center Act (ASTC Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 157-8.9 (1979) by refusing to allow the department's employees to inspect the facility. The circuit court stayed the suspension on the condition that the licensees allow the inspections, and then affirmed the suspensions when the licensees violated the stay order. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment. The licensees' argument that its facility was not subject to the ASTC Act was fundamentally inconsistent because they had no reason to appeal the suspension if they were not subject to the act. The licensee's testimony to the number of surgical abortions performed at the facility presented strong evidence that the facility was an ambulatory surgical treatment center as defined by the ASTC Act. A completed inspection of the facility would not have amounted to an unreasonable search. An exception to the search warrant requirement existed for closely regulated industries. The licensees accepted the rules by receiving their license, including the rule providing that a facility be open to inspection at all reasonable times.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both parties sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), in plaintiff employee's declaratory judgment action against defendant Board of Trustees of the Police Pension Fund of Maywood, to establish his pension rights. The employee, a police chief, began receiving a disability pension in 1968 and retired in 1980. The trial court determined that the annual pension should be 60 percent of his base salary for 1980.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee, a former police chief, was injured in the line of duty in 1961. He received a disability pension from 1968 to 1980, when he retired. The employee brought a declaratory judgment action against the Board to establish his pension rights under the Illinois Pension Code. The trial court found plaintiff entitled to a pension of 60 percent of the police chief's salary for the year prior to October 27, 1980, and both parties sought review. The court held that: (1) &sect; 3-114 of the Illinois Pension Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 3-114 (1967), the employee was entitled to a pension, pursuant to &sect; 3-111 of the Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 3-111 (1967), of one-half his salary for the year immediately prior to his retirement on disability; (2) the employee's years of service were the date his employment began until he became disabled, not until the date of his retirement; (3) Ill. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 5 (1970) created an enforceable contractual right to the pension benefits; and (4) a 1975 statutory amendment that increased the incremental rate provision did not apply because the employee made no contribution to the pension system subsequent to his disability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment, which awarded the employee retirement pension benefits in his declaratory judgment action against the Board, by the reduction of the amount from 60 percent of the police chief's salary for the year prior to October 27, 1980 to 52 percent of the salary for that period, and affirmed the judgment as modified.</SPAN></P>

After trial, defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of one to five years to run consecutively to sentences previously imposed in the State of Ohio for sexual battery and rape. Defendant argued that his voluntary absence from his trial could not be construed as an effective waiver of his right to be present and that the record failed to support a conclusion that the trial court believed a consecutive sentence was required to protect the public from further criminal conduct. On appeal, the court found that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel and to self-representation by his voluntary absence from trial. The court held that although defendant was not admonished pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A village challenged the trial court judgment that held that a village zoning ordinance, as applied to property owners' proposed development for multi-family housing, was unconstitutional, because it bore no reasonable relationship to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the village, and that the proposed use of the property was reasonable and should be permitted. The trial court enjoined the village from enforcing its zoning ordinance as to the property owners. The court affirmed the trial court judgment. The court held that the evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that surrounding uses were mixed and that the trend of development favored both single- and multi-family dwellings. The court considered the factors for determining the validity of the zoning ordinance and found the record revealed several reasons why the zoning was inappropriate. The court found the zoning classification provided the community with few benefits while causing the property owners unnecessary hardship.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the decision from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted defendants of armed robbery, unlawful restraint, and armed violence. Defendants alleged error in the admission of evidence of other crimes, improper closing argument by the State, the improper sentence for both robbery and restraint, and the imposition of a fine on one defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was robbed by the use of a knife while walking home. The victim and a witness identified defendants although the victim's testimony was somewhat contradictory. Stolen items were found on defendants including a watch and a wallet. The State referred at trial to the uncontradicted evidence, which defendants contended was a comment on their failure to testify. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendants waived the other crimes issue by not including it in their motion for a new trial. The alleged error in closing argument was also waived. Although defendants alluded to it in a general way in their new trial motion, the alleged error was not sufficiently specified. The plain error rule did not apply to either issue. The robbery and unlawful restraint charges arose from separate acts, and it was proper to sentence defendants for each crime. Finally, a fine was proper as a part of the sentence for a felony conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee, a university official, appealed the decision from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed the employee's employment discrimination suit against defendants, a former employer and its officials, on jurisdictional grounds. The issue on appeal was whether the suit was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a black university employee who alleged discrimination in his demotion and termination. The circuit court held that the suit should have been brought in the Illinois Court of Claims because it was filed under the predecessor to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 89, &sect; 9 -- 102(B) of the Illinois Human Rights Act. The state administrative agency failed to issue an order on the employee's discrimination charge within 180 days as required. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Case law held that &sect; 9 -- 102(B) was unconstitutional special legislation. However, that ruling did not dispose of the suit. Other case law held that a person had a due process property interest in seeking a resolution of an administrative discrimination charge. Thus, the circuit court's holding was no longer relevant, and even though the statute was unconstitutional, the employee still had a due process right to have the charge resolved. On remand, the employee was instructed to amend to add the Illinois Department of Human Rights and Human Rights Commission as parties, and they were ordered to process the complaint. The Illinois Court of Claims was not the proper forum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Illinois Department of Revenue appealed the decision from the Circuit Court of Edgar County (Illinois), which granted judgment to plaintiff taxpayer in its appeal of an assessment by the Department of use and sales taxes under the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act (ROTA), the Use Tax Act, the Municipal Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, and the Municipal Use Tax Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court held that portions of the assessments were for sales to purchasers for resale by them and not retail sales under the ROTA and related statutes. The statutes were intended to create a tax on sales to purchasers who in turn resold the items at retail. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 441c (1979) required a resale number to show that certain items were non-taxable. The taxpayer argued that the verification was not a condition precedent to non-taxability. The taxpayer also argued that collateral estoppel applied. On appeal, the court held that the Department properly assessed the tax on the taxpayer sales to purchasers who intended to resell the items, except for one use tax. Collateral estoppel did not apply against the State where revenue issues were involved. Para. 441c did not only apply to retailers who did not also sell for resale. Thus, the statute was applicable to entities such as the taxpayer that mostly sold for resale but also made some retail sales. The statute did not violate equal protection or constitutional uniformity requirements and a small purchase by the taxpayer of burlap bags was not subject to a use tax because the purchase was for resale.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment in favor of the taxpayer was reversed except for a use tax assessment and remanded with directions to enter judgment accordingly.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 5, &sect; 1 (1979). On appeal, the court held that the taxpayer was a &quot;retailer&quot; of tangible personal property sold for use or consumption rather than wholesale and was not statutorily exempt from taxation. The fact that the state bureau of plant and apiary protection classified the taxpayer as a &quot;farmer&quot; for the purpose of keeping labor statistics was immaterial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court, as to the third count of the village clerk's action, ordered that the 1975 salary increases of the village president and liquor control commissioner were to stand but that 1979 salary increases were void as they pertained to village officials elected in April 1979, and granted prospective relief only as to the salary increases. On appeal, the court determined that pursuant to &sect; 1-7-10 of the Code of Bridgeview Ordinances and the Municipal Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 3-8-3 (1979), it was within the power of the appropriate municipal authorities to appoint a collector and to designate that a village clerk should hold that office. However, the court found that the village clerk failed to state the proper grounds in her cause of action that she was entitled to the position of village collector. The court held that the salary increases of 1975 and 1979 were adopted after the terms of the elected officials had begun, and thus, were in violation of Ill. Const. of 1970, art.

While defendant was being driven by a deputy sheriff to the site of the drowning, defendant volunteered information about his baseball cap missing. Upon arrival of at the drowning site, defendant out-of-the-blue called attention to his missing baseball cap lying nearby.

On review, the court found that pursuant to Ill. Rev.

In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that defendant had waived his contention regarding the photographs because he had not presented the same objection at trial. However, the court found that the contention was without merit; the photographs were admissible as a proper visual aid to the jury in understanding a detective's testimony regarding defendant's demonstration of the offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, local liquor control commissioner and others, appealed from the order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which reversed the revocation of the license of plaintiffs, licensed corporation and others, after their president was convicted of grand theft because the order contained no findings regarding plaintiffs' rehabilitation or lack of it. The circuit court also refused to dismiss plaintiffs' appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' president was convicted of grand theft and sentenced to probation. Informed of the conviction, the commissioner commenced proceedings to revoke the liquor license. Proceedings were repeatedly continued, at the request of plaintiffs, while the conviction was being unsuccessfully appealed. When the matter was finally heard, the hearing examiner found that the president had been convicted and therefore was ineligible to hold a license pursuant to &sect; 2(4) of art. VI of the Liquor Control Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 43, para. 120(4) (1977)). The license appeal commission affirmed the order. Plaintiffs did not filed a motion for rehearing, but instead filed a complaint in the circuit court for judicial review. The circuit court reversed because the order contained no findings regarding plaintiffs' rehabilitation or lack of it. It also refused to dismiss plaintiffs' appeal. Defendants sought review. The court reversed and remanded to the circuit court with directions to set aside its judgment and to dismiss the appeal. Plaintiffs failed to file a petition for rehearing, as required by statute; the circuit court erred in refusing to dismiss the complaint for administrative review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that (1) he was denied his right to a jury trial; (2) his convictions and sentences for possession of codeine and diazepam were void because prior decisions invalidated the statute on which those counts were based; (3) the legislature improperly classified cocaine as a narcotic; (4) he was denied effective assistance of counsel; (5) he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; and (6) his sentence was excessive for a person with no prior record. Upon review, the court found that the trial court erred in convicting and sentencing defendant for possession of diazepam. Defendant's conviction and sentence for possession of diazepam, a Schedule IV controlled substance, should have been vacated because Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1402(b) (1977) was declared unconstitutional in an earlier case. All of the sentences imposed upon defendant were well within the statutory limits for the offenses charged and were carefully considered before their imposition. The court vacated the sentence imposed under the count of the indictment charging defendant with possession of diazepam and did not find the remaining sentences excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of theft in a jury trial on evidence that he falsely reported to his insurance company the theft from his car of a radio-telephone for which he received $ 1,400 from the insurance company. He claimed that the State adduced evidence outside the bill of particulars.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1975, defendant installed a radio-telephone unit in his Excalibur automobile. He insured the car and radio-telephone unit. Later that year, he reported to the police that a burglary occurred in his garage, and that the car's tires, wheels, and radio-telephone unit were taken. Defendant subsequently reported his loss to the insurer and was paid $ 1,400 . The next year the radio-telephone he had reported stolen reappeared in his possession. He was convicted of theft. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in allowing the State to introduce evidence that went beyond the scope of its bills of particulars, which stated that the theft was a continuing offense beginning on or about September 1975 and culminating in February 1976. The court found that evidence concerning events that occurred in 1977 and 1978 was properly received because it was introduced to prove that defendant had committed a crime within the period specified in the bill of particulars. The court reasoned that a bill of particulars that specified that an offense took place at a particular time did not preclude the introduction of evidence of events leading up to or after the offense.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed. The court affirmed the conviction for armed violence but vacated the convictions for aggravated battery. Hearsay statements complained of were either admissible for impeachment purposes or were not prejudicial to defendant. Even if it was error to fail to instruct the jury specifically that prior inconsistent statements were not to be considered as substantive evidence, defendant failed to object at trial. Thus, the error was waived on appeal. An officer was erroneously permitted to testify as to a witness's identification of defendant. However, this testimony was cumulative and did not require reversal. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow defendant to confront a State's witness with a prior inconsistent statement. A negative answer from the witness would have required the calling of another witness who had been exempt from the witness exclusion order. The single act of shooting the victim was the basis of defendant's convictions. Thus, defendant should have been convicted of armed violence only.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, one wife maintained that the spouse of an injured worker was a protected person under the terms of the Act. The other wife claimed the Act neither conferred nor barred her action for loss of consortium because a common law action for loss of consortium automatically arose when her husband suffered a bodily injury for which he could recover. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of those portions of the wives' complaints based on the Act, holding: (1) that absent an allegation that the wives were injured while employed on or passing under a scaffold, the wives were clearly outside the Act's protection, and (2) that the duty created under the Act was not transferable by judicial decision to third persons outside the Act's protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated battery and reckless conduct and acquitted of armed violence and armed robbery. Defendant claimed that: (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion for mistrial; (2) the verdicts were legally inconsistent; and (3) the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the physical evidence. The court held that defendant's motion for a mistrial, made upon learning from the translator that she had improperly paraphrased the testimony of the complainant-witness, was properly denied. The court reasoned that the translator's problem was grounded in the manner that defense counsel asked questions that invited paraphrasing. The court held that the jury's verdicts were not legally inconsistent, but that even if they were, reversal was not warranted because such inconsistency may have been the result of the jury's free exercise of its &quot;historic power of lenity.&quot; The court vacated the conviction for reckless conduct because it was a lesser-included offense of aggravated battery. The court concluded that the warrantless entry to arrest defendant pursuant to probable cause and exigent circumstances was not violative of the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer refused to hire the employment applicant because he had long hair. The city's human relations commission found that the employer discriminated against the applicant in violation of a city ordinance that prohibited discrimination based on personal appearance. The employer sought judicial review in the trial court, which held that the ordinance was unconstitutional under Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(a) (1970). The city and the applicant appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the local ordinance was preempted by the Illinois Human Rights Act (IHRA), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 68, para. 1-101 et seq., which did not prohibit personal appearance discrimination. The court said that under Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(a) (1970), if the subject matter was found to be within the ambit of the government and affairs of the home-rule unit, then the unit had the power to legislate with regard to that matter. However, the court said that if a state statute regulated the same matter, then the state law controlled if it was intended to preempt the field.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several witnesses testified that defendant was at the location of the homicide, left for a period of time, and then returned and shot the victim.

Defendant claimed that an individual with whom the witnesses were closely related had shot the victim and that he was at the home of two other individuals when the victim was shot. Defense counsel submitted the names of alibi witnesses to the prosecutor during discovery and the prosecutor referred to the alibi witnesses as phantoms during closing argument. On appeal, the court held that because defendant injected the alibi witnesses into the case, the prosecutor properly commented on his failure to produce them or explain their absence. The court held that the inconsistencies in the eyewitnesses' testimony and their bias were insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to defendant's guilt. The court held that the trial court properly imposed the fine under Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot a friend, believing him to be someone else and that his life was in danger. Defendant argued that it was improper for a conviction and sentence to be entered on the crime of armed violence when the predicate felony offense was aggravated battery with a dangerous weapon. The court rejected the state's counter argument, holding that the failure of the indictment to state an offense could be attacked and was not waived by defendant's failure to raise the issue in his post-trial motion. The court agreed with defendant that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to sever the count charging him with unlawful use of weapons within five years of his release from the penitentiary, following his conviction of a felony under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 24-1(b) (1979). The court held that the issue was not waived and could be considered because the imposition of the sentence would deprive defendant of a substantial liberty interest. The court held that under Ill Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3.2(b)(1) defendant's extended-term sentence was improper because it did not arise out of a different series of acts from the prior robbery and therefore should be vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Days before defendant's trial was set to begin on charges of the delivery of cocaine defendant presented an alibi defense. The explanation defendant provided for the delay was that he had spoken to a person at a certain location away from the crime scene at the time of the crime but only became aware of that person's identity days before trial, when he presented the defense. The trial court excluded the defense and allowed defendant to testify only that he was not present at the crime scene. Defendant was convicted and, on appeal, claimed the exclusion of his alibi defense amounted to trial court error. On appeal, the court affirmed and found that the trial court properly excluded the alibi defense and the witnesses who were scheduled to testify as to that defense. The court reasoned that if defendant had a bona fide alibi, he could have given the state timely notice of his intention to assert such an alibi by his own testimony, at least, even before he located corroborating witnesses. The &quot;eleventh hour&quot; alibi defense suggested fabrication and was properly not allowed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgments of conviction. The court found that defendants' guilt had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. The court stated that defendants' action before, during, and after the murders made them accountable, despite the fact that neither of them actually shot the victims. The court found that the jury's rejection of defendants' claim of compulsion was supported by the evidence. There was no evidence that defendants assisted in the murders under a threat of death or great bodily injury.

Defendant retrieved a revolver from his automobile and proceeded to strike the couple with the weapon. A scuffle ensued in which several shots were fired. As the fight continued, defendant reloaded his weapon and shot up his friend's living room. Defendant was convicted, following a jury trial, of four counts of armed violence, two counts of aggravated battery, two counts of aggravated assault, and one count of unlawful use of weapons. He was sentenced to concurrent nine-year sentences of imprisonment on each of the four counts of armed violence. Defendant sought review. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences for armed violence, finding that criminal damage to property in excess of $ 150 was a felony that could serve as a predicate felony for armed violence. The court also held that the minimum penalty of six years' imprisonment for armed violence was not unconstitutional. The court further held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the state's request to have defendant's girlfriend declared a hostile witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor entered into a contract with the State. It later brought an action against the State for breach of contract. The trial court granted the State's motion to dismiss, pursuant to the State's sovereign immunity. The contractor sought review, and the court found reversible error. The court held that the doctrine of sovereign immunity did not bar the action because the State had consented to being sued by entering into a validly authorized contract with the contractor. The court found that, in order for a contract to exist at all, there had to be mutuality. That meant that the contract had to be enforceable by both contracting parties. Therefore, the State's claim that it could sue on a contract, but could not be sued in return was untenable. The court held that when the State entered into a contract with a private party, it was acting in a business or proprietary capacity. In so doing, it laid aside whatever privilege of sovereign immunity it otherwise possessed and bound itself to performance, just as any private citizen would do by so contracting.</SPAN></P>

The truck drivers followed defendant's instructions. The loaded trucks were stopped and defendant approached the employer with a demand to sign a contract, stating that the drums on the trucks would not be turned until the contract was signed. Defendant was subsequently convicted of intimidation in violation of subsection (a)(3) of the intimidation statute, Ill. Rev.

Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 2701 (1979). The State claimed that the officers were exempt from the provisions of &sect; 2701.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant learned that for every 10 driving while under the influence arrests made, an officer would receive one day off with pay. Defendant claimed that because that acted as additional compensation for the officers, their testimony was inadmissible under &sect; 2701. The court reversed. Section 2701 had been closely linked with Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 2601 et seq. (1979), which provided for the licensing and regulation of detectives. The court found that the provisions of &sect; 2601 did not apply to any detective or officer belonging to the state police force and that the exemption for police officers applied to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 2701 (1979) as well. The court found that a police officer, when issuing a ticket, was acting as a member of the executive branch of government, and to explore the motivation of the officer in issuing the ticket would be an invasion of that branch of government. The motivation could have a bearing on the weight or credibility of the evidence, however, the court could not say defendant suffered a deprivation of due process as a result of the day-off policy.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-20a (1979)), contending that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad, unconstitutionally vague, and violated due process requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of child pornography, and in affirming his conviction the court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-20(a) (1979) was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Defendant relinquished any constitutional protections when he removed the child pornography from the confines of his own home and exhibited it to another. Unlike other forms of obscenity legislation, the evil sought to be prevented by the child pornography statute was not any alleged &quot;antisocial behavior&quot; which might result from the viewing of such material. Rather, the statute sought to protect the real victims of child pornography, the children needed for its production. The court agreed that a ban on such exhibition would decrease the demand for such material, thus decreasing the need for solicitation of children for its production. The commonly understood meaning of the word &quot;exhibit&quot; implied both public and private displays, so that defendant was properly prosecuted thereunder. Since &sect; 11-20a clearly incorporated the obscenity standards articulated by the Supreme Court, defendant's contention that the statute was unconstitutionally vague was rejected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no constitutional infirmity with the child pornography statute under which defendant was prosecuted, and his conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the station wagon drove off a bridge, one passenger was rendered a paraplegic and the other sustained brain damage. A jury found the driver's negligence to be the proximate cause of the injuries and awarded $ 1,569,000 to the paraplegic passenger and $ 465,000 to the passenger suffering from brain damage. The driver appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the driver waived his allegation that the trial court erred in refusing to direct a verdict for the driver based upon the Iowa guest statute by failing to raise the issue prior to the conclusion of the evidence. Similarly, the driver waived his objections to voir dire questions by failing to object to the procedure established by the trial court. Nevertheless, the court stated that the voir dire questions citing a specific verdict amount were within the bounds set by the trial court and case law. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the finding that the driver was negligent and that the verdicts were not excessive given the seriousness of the passengers' injuries. The driver's allegations of error in the admission of evidence were either waived or meritless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which awarded damages to the passengers as a result of the driver's negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation sought review of the trial court's judgment, which upheld the Department's order directing the corporation to comply with the Health Act or to establish that it was exempt from its provision requiring the corporation's procurement of a charter, under both the Vision Act and the Illinois Dental Service Plan Act, to allow it to provide vision and dental care services to employees. The corporation contended that the Department lacked jurisdiction over the corporation, because it was preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, that the Health Act was permissive in its application, rather than mandatory, and that the Health Act violated the corporation's constitutional and civil rights. The court on appeal affirmed the trial court's decision based on its determination that (1) the Health Act was applicable to the corporation; (2) the Health Act required the mandatory compliance of all voluntary health services plan, including the corporation; and (3) the corporation's constitutional claim was not addressable, because the corporation failed to adequately specify the manner in which its asserted constitutional rights were infringed.</SPAN></P>

She claimed she did not violate any statute, but if she did that statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that &sect; 33-1(a) was not unconstitutionally vague. The phrase &quot;personal advantage&quot; had previously been determined to mean an advantage to a particular person as opposed to the public the officer or employee served. Here the defendant tendered with a certain mental state that met the specificity required even when First Amendment issues were at issue. The court found that the Illinois statutory scheme defined with specificity &quot;property or personal advantage&quot; which a legislator was authorized by law to accept. Public officials were authorized by law to receive campaign contributions from those who might seek to influence the candidate's performance as long as no promise for or performance of a specific official act was given in exchange.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before defendant was sentenced to probation, a presentence report was prepared and filed in the record. The presentence investigation revealed that defendant had been convicted of burglary and attempted burglary. It further established that defendant had been convicted of illegal possession of cannabis, possession of a hypodermic syringe, disorderly conduct, and unlawful possession of a prescription form. Defendant's probation was revoked based on his having committed forgery and his unlawful possession of the prescription form, after defendant admitted the allegations of the petition to revoke probation. After defendant was sentenced, he contended that he was entitled to a new sentencing hearing because the trial court had failed to order an updated presentence report. The court found that the presentence report was deficient because it did not reflect defendant's history from the time of admission to probation. However, the court found that defendant's testimony supplied the missing information. The court also found that defendant and the State had waived a new presentence report. The court concluded that defendant's sentence was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with public indecency, obscenity, and keeping a disorderly house after they were observed performing oral sex on each other. Defendants filed a motion to suppress evidence in the case on the grounds their arrests were effected without a warrant. They alleged their conduct was protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and could not be restrained without a warrant or prior judicial determination. The trial court suppressed all evidence in the pending matter. The state appealed. The issue for review was whether the trial court erred in suppressing the evidence in the matter, as the alleged misconduct was not entitled to First Amendment constitutional protections. The court reversed and remanded the matter. The court held that the police officer's observations before the arrests could not be suppressed, as his observations were not conclusive on any obscenity issue. However, defendants still were entitled to their day in court on the charge and could present whatever evidence they had to refute this charge.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was evidence that the trial judge understood that the co-defendant had fired the gun.
