</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a company and its president, appealed from an order of the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota), granting in part defendant competitors' motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial in an action in which plaintiffs alleged that defendants libeled plaintiffs, disparaged plaintiffs' products, infringed its trademark and service mark, and competed unfairly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought an action alleging that defendants libeled plaintiffs and disparaged plaintiff company's products among other claims. The jury found for plaintiffs on libel and disparagement claims. Court granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict on plaintiffs' claims, ordered new trial on plaintiffs' damages. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the evidence was sufficient for a jury to find defendants libeled plaintiff president. The jury verdict for plaintiff president was reinstated. At trial plaintiffs proved one tort. Damages were assessed on two. Thus new trial was required on the issue of libel of plaintiff company. The trial court's holding that plaintiff company could recover in libel without showing special pecuniary damages was correct. The jury's consideration of time-barred statements was permissible pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 549.20(3) (1982) requiring consideration of duration of defendant's conduct. Damages award was not abuse of discretion and injunction as to libelous material was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order granting judgment n.o.v. insofar as it held that plaintiff president's libel claim was time-barred, and the jury verdict was reinstated in favor of plaintiff president. A new trial was ordered on the issue of damages to plaintiff company. Otherwise, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The secretary claimed the incorporation of the federal definition of &quot;small business&quot; into the Minnesota Energy and Economic Development Act (Act) was an unlawful delegation of legislative power and that the benefits from the expenditures authorized under the Act for the project of developing job growth in Minnesota is not a public function and prohibited by the Minn. Const. arts. X, &sect; 1, XI, &sect; 2, XII, &sect; 1. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the Act was a constitutionally valid method of financing job development in the state and held that the constitutional provisions were required to be interpreted to meet contemporary activities of government and society and that the Act should be read in a manner which upheld its constitutionality. The court further held that providing economic development through job growth was a public function in which the state could constitutionally be involved and the financing scheme established by the authority was based on revenue bonds, for which no tax money would be paid.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that the State was immune from liability pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 3.736, subd. 3(h).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners sued the State to recover damages to their growing crops as a result of flooding allegedly caused by the State's negligent construction, maintenance, and operation of a system of pools in a wildlife management area. The trial court, relying on statutory exceptions to the State's tort liability under the Tort Claims Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 3.736 (1982), held that the State was immune from liability under the exception to liability found in Minn. Stat. &sect; 3.736, subd. 3(h), which stated that the State was immune from liability for any loss arising out of construction, operation, and maintenance of an outdoor recreation system, with the exception that the State was liable for conduct that would have entitled a trespasser to damages against a private person. Summary judgment was granted to the State. The court held that pursuant to the immunity stated in Minn. Stat. &sect; 3.736, subd. 3(h), the state was not liable for property damage. The shield afforded by Minn. Stat. &sect; 3.736, subd. 3(h) was rationally related to the purpose of the preservation of the State's outdoor recreational resources. Minn. Stat. &sect; 3.736, subd. 3(h) thus did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner appealed from an order and a judgment of dismissal entered by the District Court, Dakota County (Minnesota), in the property owner's action to obtain rezoning of its property by defendant city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court concluded that the city code was ambiguous as to whether planned development zoning could be granted only when supplementary to an underlying classification. The city had advanced absolutely no reason for the denial of roadside business (RB) zoning except to say it did not conform with the council practices and was not required under the city code. The court determined that the ordinance was vague and equivocal as to what &quot;basic&quot; zoning meant. The city's own comprehensive plan designated the property in question as RB. Refusing to grant an underlying rezoning was inconsistent with the zoning practices of neighboring cities. The parcel of land was not suitable for agricultural or residential use, and the property owner had been paying commercial real estate taxes. Under the particular facts, the refusal to grant an underlying RB rezoning without stating any justification for the refusal was arbitrary and capricious action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded to the trial court for the issuance of an order directing the city council to grant the property owner an underlying rezoning from agricultural in addition to the planned development zoning already granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision by the District Court, Beltrami County (Minnesota) in which he was found guilty of violations of Minn. Stat. &sect; 624.72 (1982) (interference with the use of public property, a gross misdemeanor) and Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.595 (1982) (criminal damage to property, a misdemeanor). Defendant's motions for a judgment n.o.v. or for a new trial on the gross misdemeanor charge were denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues presented arose out of a nonviolent, antinuclear war demonstration organized by defendant at a university. Defendant was sentenced to a six-month term on the first count (interference with the use of public property) and 90 days in the county jail on the second count (criminal damage to property). The sentences were to run concurrently but execution was stayed on both counts. The terms of defendant's 2-year probation included 40 hours of public service on each count, full restitution, and a fine of $ 250. His probation was subsequently revoked for failure to report to his probation officer, failure to obtain permission to leave the state, and failure to obey all state and federal laws and local ordinances. The sentences were executed. The court found that the use of the phrase &quot;prima facie evidence&quot; in the jury instruction without defining it, and the use of a disputed jury instruction, might have impermissibly shifted the burden of persuasion to defendant, in the minds of the jury members as to the crucial issue of intent. Under previous caselaw the instruction was therefore unconstitutional and the lower court judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant manufactured housing institute sought review of the decision of the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota), which upheld Minn. R. &sect; 1.448 (1982) as promulgated by respondent Commissioner of Health (commissioner). Rule 1.448 of the Minnesota Health Department set a maximum indoor air level of formaldehyde in newly constructed housing units.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The institute contended on appeal that the commissioner exceeded his authority in promulgating the rule, and that the rule was unconstitutional. The institute further claimed that the trial court erred in restricting its review solely to the record in the administrative rulemaking proceeding. The court affirmed the trial court's judicial review of the rule on the record, but reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court validating the rule because the maximum ambient level of formaldehyde set by the rule was an arbitrary and capricious determination. The court found that it was unfortunate that the commissioner chose to announce the determination that formaldehyde in building materials posed a significant health problem in a press release, but that the determination was duly made. The court found, however, that there was no explanation of how the conflicts and ambiguities in the evidence were resolved, no explanation of any assumptions made or the suppositions underlying such assumptions, no articulation of the policy judgments, and that there was no reasoned determination of why a level of 0.5 ppm was selected by the commissioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, in part, the trial court's decision upholding the rule regarding the maximum indoor air level of formaldehyde in newly constructed housing units such as those of the institute, and remanded the case to the commissioner to reconsider the portion of the rule setting the level. The court affirmed, in part, the decision of the trial court establishing judicial review of the rule on the record only.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 340.95 (1980), to limit the restaurant's damages and made rulings adverse to the restaurant in the motorcyclist's personal injury action against defendants, the restaurant, a truck driver, and the truck's owner. The motorcyclist argued that the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorcyclist was struck by the truck driver, who was intoxicated, pinned under the motorcycle, and dragged nearly a mile, causing severe injuries. The jury awarded the motorcyclist $ 4.349 million, but the trial court capped the damages at $ 250,000 pursuant to the Act. The motorcyclist appealed, asserting that the Act's cap provision was unconstitutional because it deprived him of equal protection of the law under the U.S. and Minnesota Constitutions. The court reversed and remanded. The court found that the classification in the Act was overbroad in light of its purpose because it imposed a cap on actions under the Act but did not cap damages against a 3.2 percent beer vendor. The court found it inconsistent to limit the liability of one class while imposing unlimited liability on the other when potential liability was equal, and more inconsistent to limit the liability of the class which evidenced greater alcohol abuse. A victim of a tort, the court pointed out, did not care whether the tortfeasor was intoxicated by 3.2 percent alcohol or stronger liquor. The court declined to add curative language to the Act, and affirmed or found harmless the trial court's trial rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found for the motorcyclist and reversed the trial court, remanding the matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal defendant first argued that the trial court erred when it admitted into evidence a statement that he made to the police after he was arrested in another matter approximately four months before the shooting. Defendant contended that the statement should have been suppressed because the police conduct at that time constituted an illegal arrest and an illegal search and seizure. The court disagreed and held that the police had a reasonable factual basis for believing that defendant might have been armed and the investigatory stop and subsequent &quot;pat down&quot; search were justified. The court also held that defendant voluntarily and without interrogation made the statement in question. Next, defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting his confession made regarding the shooting. The court decided that the State met its burden of proof that defendant's confession was voluntarily and freely given. Defendant also asserted that it was prejudicial error to exclude expert testimony of a psychiatrist but the court noted that psychiatric expert testimony on the issue of specific intent was not admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a 43-year-old woman, appealed a judgment of the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota), which dismissed her libel action against defendants, the University of Minnesota student newspaper and others, for failure to file a notice of claim within 180 days as required by Minn. Stat. &sect; 3.736, subd. 5 (1982). Plaintiff alleged she was libeled by the publication of her picture with a caption the she was an older woman who was &quot;cruising.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's attorney only sent notice to the paper 11 months after the publication, and plaintiff filed the instant action a year later, alleging the photograph had defamed her by falsely accusing her of unchastity and sexual promiscuity. The trial court dismissed the complaint because plaintiff failed to notify defendants of her claim within 180 days as required by &sect; 3.736, subd. 5. However, the court reversed because the failure to file notice was not a jurisdictional prerequisite of &sect; 3.736, subd. 5. The court concluded that the legislature had apparently made a conscious decision to exclude language to that effect from the final bill, as it had been in earlier versions. Further, the State Tort Claims Act contained no other provision stating that failure to give notice was grounds for dismissal of the complaint, and the action was filed within the statute of limitations in Minn. Stat. &sect; 3.736, subd. 11. Although the State could assert the absence of notice as a defense, providing it could establish prejudice, and the trier of fact could consider the effect of the failure to receive notice in determining liability or damages, the case could not be dismissed for lack of notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant claimed that he was not responsible for the murder and rape of the victim because he was suffering from a mental condition that impaired his volition and capacity to control his behavior at the time of the crime. On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that he had satisfied his burden of proving excuse by mental illness. The court held that defendant's argument on volition and capacity was a restatement of the &quot;irresistible impulse'&quot; definition of insanity, which had been rejected as the definition for insanity in prior cases. The standard for excuse under Minn. Stat. &sect; 611.026 (1982) was whether defendant was incapable of knowing his action was wrong. Defendant's expert had testified that defendant knew what he did was wrong. The court also found that there was evidence to support a jury finding that defendant did have the capacity to control his behavior. There was testimony that defendant had controlled his rape impulses in the past and that on the night of the crime he waited for his victim for 45 minutes. The court ruled that pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.04, it was error to convict defendant of multiple counts for the single criminal act.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 298.24 (1982). The taxpayer sought review of the formulation for an averaging method used as one alternative for determining the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer accepted the independent, but not alternating, use of a three-year averaging method and an annual production method, Minn. Stat. &sect; 298.24, subd. 1 (1982), for determining the disputed tax. The taxpayer claimed that while either method alone was constitutional, when used together for alternate years, double taxation resulted. The Tax Court held that the averaging method of valuation was constitutional, but that use of the alternating valuation methods violated the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and the uniformity clause of Minn. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1. The Tax Court also ruled that Minn. Stat. &sect; 298.24 violated the Due Process Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7. On review, the court upheld the Tax Court's subject-matter jurisdiction, but it reversed the finding that the tax scheme was unconstitutional. The court held that the disputed tax in Minn. Stat. &sect; 298.24 was, in effect, a &quot;property tax,&quot; so the taxpayer's arguments regarding unlawfulness of the tax as a &quot;production tax&quot; were without merit. The court also found that the Tax Court erred in deciding not to use a price index adjustment under the averaging method.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the tax court's ruling that it had subject matter jurisdiction.

Stat. &sect; 176.101, subd. 6 of the Workers' Compensation Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 176.101, subd. 6 compensated permanently disabled minors at a rate based on the larger of their weekly wage or the statewide average weekly wage. Because, at the time the applicant's case was raised, the statewide average is currently the maximum rate of compensation available under the &sect; 176.101, subd. 1, the applicant received compensation at the maximum rate although his weekly wage was below the maximum rate. This resulted in the applicant's receipt of more compensation than he would have gotten had he been an adult. Appellants argued that this result was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the state and federal constitutions. The court found that, under the rational basis test, the statute, intended to compensate for the loss of earning capacity, met the legislature's purpose of protecting the lives and safety of employees. The requirement that employers pay adults at a higher rate discouraged them from hiring inexperienced employees from doing dangerous work. Appellants argued that the statute was not narrowly tailored , but the court found the statutory scheme was not too broad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of Minneapolis originally commenced this zoning action in the form of a motion for a temporary injunction pursuant to Minn.

The residents, unincorporated association of residents living in the neighborhood of the church, intervened as plaintiff. The city alleged that the property was zoned as an R1 single family residential district and that the church was in violation of Minneapolis, Minn. Code of Ordinances &sect; 522.40, which limited the occupancy of a duplex (which was the prior use of the building) to two family units unless the premises were properly converted to other than residential use. The court held that church's uses of the property were permitted under &sect;&sect; 538.120(4) and 538.120(6)(k). Evidence adduced at trial supported these findings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved a challenge by the bank to taxes assessed under Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.13 (2a) (1982) by several counties on severed mineral interests held by the bank. The bank claimed that it was exempt from the tax because the tax was not a tax on real estate according to its value, and the bank was therefore exempt under a federal statute&nbsp;12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2055. The court held that since the severed mineral interest tax pursuant to &sect; 273.13 (2a) was unrelated to value, &sect; 2055 precluded its imposition on the bank's interests. The requirement that the tax be related to value limits, the tax which a state could have levied on the bank's real estate to an ad valorem tax, for which real estate was assessed and the tax rate was applied on the same basis to the assessed value of all real estate similarly situated in the taxing district. Further, a federal instrumentality was immune from all state taxes, whether or not discriminatory, unless the state showed that Congress expressly had waived the immunity. Inasmuch as there was no showing of a clear and express waiver, the bank's several mineral interests were immune from the tax imposed by 273.13 (2a). The court reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff unions challenged the validity of 1982 Minn. Sess. Law Serv. 1819 (Act), which required various state, county and municipal employees to pay an additional two percent of their salaries into their respective pension funds, by petitioning for a writ of quo warranto in an effort to prevent the enforcement of the Act. The District Court, Ramsey County (Minnesota) dismissed the complaint. The unions sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the Act effected a number of tax increases, spending cuts, and spending shifts, the only portion of the Act challenged were the provisions impacting upon the terms of public employees' employment, primarily the provision regarding public employees' pension contributions. The trial court dismissed the unions' complaint. The unions appealed. The court affirmed, holding that no contract or contract term, express or implied, existed between public employers and employees which guaranteed fixed levels of employee retirement contributions to the pension funds. Nor did the record support the unions' claim to a fixed level of employee pension contributions based on a promissory estoppel theory. Thus, the unions failed to establish a right, based either on conventional contract or promissory estoppel theories, to a fixed level of employee pension contributions. Moreover, the Act withstood rational basis review with respect to the unions' equal protection challenge. In addition, the court rejected the unions' uniformity clause challenge because public employee pension contributions were not a tax within the meaning of that state constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota) upholding the constitutionality of the prehearing driver's license revocation proceedings under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.123 (1982). A second defendant's appeal from an order of a three-judge panel of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota), which affirmed a municipal court order revoking his license, was consolidated for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were drivers who had their driver's licenses revoked pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.123 (1982), the implied consent law, which mandated the suspension of a license upon the refusal to take a chemical test for alcohol concentration or the failure of a test by registering an alcohol concentration of .10 or more. On appeal, the court upheld the constitutionality of the statute with regard to due process and the privilege against self-incrimination. The court acknowledged that driver's licenses were property interests subject to due process protection but found that the Minnesota prehearing license revocation process was compatible with the Massachusetts scheme that was held compliant with due process by the United States Supreme Court with regard to an analysis of the private interest at stake, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest as a result of the procedures used, and the state interests served by the use of such summary procedures. The court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.123 did not compel unconstitutional self-incrimination because the statute did not require drivers to give incriminating evidence to obtain review of their license revocations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 62A.31- 42 (1982) prohibited the sale of insurance policies which purported to supplement Medicare health insurance to persons age 65 older, unless certain statutory requirements were met. The citizens contended that the state had wrongfully interfered with their right of contract and their right of privacy because of their age. The court held that the appropriate standard of review for the legislation was the rational basis test because neither freedom of choice nor freedom of contract was a fundamental right requiring strict scrutiny and further, age was not a suspect classification. The court found that the age classification was rationally related to achievement of a legitimate governmental purpose and, because it would not substitute its judgment for that of the legislature, the court upheld the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 62A.31- 42 (1982).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation challenged &sect; 272.02, subd. 1(6) on uniformity clause and equal protection grounds. The court held that the legislative classification for tax purposes based on a distinction between government-supported charities with operations of a commercial nature and privately supported charitable institutions was not arbitrary and was reasonably grounded. The next consideration was whether the classification was relevant to the purpose of the law that the state declared was to provide limited tax relief to a distinct class of charitable institutions while providing full exemption to others. The court held that the State had the right to equalize the tax burden to offset tax-related advantages enjoyed by one group over another. The court held that the corporation had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Minn. Stat. &sect; 272.02, subd. 1(6) was arbitrary and without any conceivable basis in fact.

The driver brought a third-party action against the owners of the supper club where the driver claimed he was negligently served alcohol in the form of 3.2 beer. The lower court found the owners negligent and partially liable for the accident victim's injuries. The lower court denied the owners' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial on the issue of liability, and the owners sought review. On review, the owners claimed that the lower court erroneously ruled that the standard for the negligent sale of 3.2 beer was that of sale to an intoxicated person, not an obviously intoxicated person. The court found conflicting standards in Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 340.14, subd. 1a and 340.73, subd. 1. The court held that this conflict violated federal and state constitutional provisions for equal protection by holding vendors of 3.2 beer to a different standard than vendors of intoxicating liquor.

Stat. &sect; 290.19 so as to lower the hypothetical income tax liability and thereby also lowering the ceiling on the mining company's aggregate tax liability. The court held that clause (b) of Minn. Stat. &sect; 298.40 was to be construed to read that a taconite producer's aggregate tax should not exceed the amount such producer would pay if taxed under the income, franchise, and excise tax laws generally applicable to manufacturing corporations transacting business in Minnesota.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two accomplices robbed a woman. They forced her into a car and raped her. The woman's male companion was locked in the car's trunk. An accomplice beat the woman with a board. She was fatally injured. Defendant was convicted of third-degree murder, second-degree criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping, and aggravated robbery. The trial court sentenced defendant to concurrent sentences of 24 and 4 years for the murder and kidnapping charges. Both sentences were departures from the presumptive sentences prescribed by the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and reduced his sentence for murder to 16 years. The court noted that double departures for both crimes were justified given defendant's substantial role in the robbery and rape. However, upward departures greater than twice the presumptive sentence required severe aggravating circumstances. While the treble departure on the murder charge was probably an attempt to equalize defendant's sentences with his accomplices, who were convicted of first-degree murder, the court noted that such action negated the more favorable verdict received by defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the introduction of evidence of the absence of tests in accord with &sect; 169.121 subd. 2(b) did not violate defendant's constitutional right to be free from compelled self-incrimination because it did not permit the introduction of evidence that defendant refused chemical testing, and it contained sufficient safeguards to avoid drawing such an inference. The court held that &sect; 169.121 in no way interfered with the judiciary's function of ascertaining facts and applying the law to the facts established, but merely provided a method for enhancing the likelihood that a jury would not impermissibly speculate as to the reason no test results were offered; and nor did the increased penalty constitute an ex post facto law because merely allowing a conviction obtained before the amendment to be used in the assessment of the penalty for a subsequent offense did not violate the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The representative contended that the resident/non-resident marital exemption distinction of Minn. Stat. &sect; 291.051, subd. 1 (1978) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The marital exemption, formerly available to spouses of deceased residents, was not available to spouses of deceased non-residents. The representative's deceased spouse was a Colorado resident who died in November 1978, leaving his entire real and personal property to the representative, which included an undivided one-half interest in real estate in Minnesota. The representative claimed the marital deduction provided in &sect; 291.051, subd. 1, and paid the inheritance tax on the transfer of the real property. The Commissioner, pointing out that the statute did not provide the exemption to non-residents, claimed an additional amount. The court agreed with the tax court that the Commissioner's denial of the marital exemption under &sect; 291.051, subd. 1 to a spouse of a non-resident decedent was not violative of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a newspaper and its editor, challenged an order from the District Court, Stearns County (Minnesota), which determined that respondents, a school board and a superintendent of schools, did not violate the Minnesota Open Meeting Law, Minn. Stat. &sect; 471.705 (1980), when it failed to give public notice of long-range planning meetings for the school district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The theme of the meetings was long-range planning for the school district. A common format was the presentation of a paper by an administrator, followed by a discussion among those present. Topics included long-range planning, enrollment decline, goals of the board of education, kindergarten organization, transportation funding, school district finances, et cetera. The court reversed the decision and held that, while it could be in the best interest of the public to close certain meetings of public bodies, the reasons for electing not to open the meetings at issue in the instant case, that no official actions were taken, were outweighed by the public's right to be informed. In Minnesota, all meetings of public agencies were to be open, with rare and carefully restrained exceptions. Although no official actions were taken, the meetings were, nevertheless, part of the decision-making process of which the public had a right to know. The term &quot;meetings&quot; in &sect; 471.705 was to be broadly interpreted. Further, the superintendent was not subject to the requirements and penalties of &sect; 471.705.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the determination that the meetings were not subject to the Open Meeting Law and that the school superintendent was subject to the Open Meeting Law. The court remanded the action with instructions that the school district was enjoined from conducting future meetings in violation of the Open Meeting Law. Civil penalties not to exceed $ 100 were available and the trial court could consider the good faith of the school board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer was shot while executing a search warrant and the employee injured his back on the job. The officer was awarded $ 712,013 and his attorney $ 5,450 in fees. His attorney filed an application for excess fees in the amount of $ 80,000 and was awarded $ 20,000. The city refused to pay a portion of the award. The employee's attorney was granted fees less than the $ 10,000 provided in a settlement agreement. On appeal, the court held that: (1) partial reimbursement by the city to the officer's attorney of the excess attorney fees awarded was mandatory; (2) an amendment to the state's workers' compensation laws providing that settlements were presumptively fair should not have been applied retroactively and thus the compensation court was not bound to accept the settlement's provision for attorney fees; (3) the lower courts failed to detail findings with respect to their determination of the reasonable value of the attorneys' services; and (4) the limitation imposed by Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.081 (1982) on fees was reasonably related to the goals of protecting employees from excessive fees and insuring that employees had competent counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the constitutionality of the statute restricting attorney fees. The court reversed the lower court of appeals in the police officer's case insofar as it failed to order partial reimbursement of the excess attorney fees by the city. The court remanded both cases to the lower court of appeals to make adequate findings of fact with respect to the reasonable value of the attorneys' services.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court dismissing the retired official's action, holding that: (1) prior to the enactment of &sect; 422A.156, the official was entitled to begin receiving his pension when he retired; (2) the gratuity theory of public pensions was no longer applicable; (3) a public employee's interest in a pension was best characterized in terms of promissory estoppel; (4) the State's promise that the retired official would be paid a pension when he retired was binding on the State; and (5) &sect; 422A.156 was invalid as an unconstitutional impairment of contractual obligations to the extent that it purported to apply to elected city officials already retired at the time of its enactment.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 253A.04, subd. 1 (1980).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The involuntary patient contended that Minn.

The court found that the involuntary patient's first claim was mooted by the adoption of Minn. Stat. ch. 253B (1982). The court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the doctors were immune from liability because they were state employees. The court found that the doctors did act in good faith and were immune from liability under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court held that given the present statute, the issues as to whether a recent overt act, attempt, or threat of harm to self or others was required by due process and whether all doctors were immune from liability for damages were moot. The court found that a hearing within 72 hours of confinement was not constitutionally mandated because there were more imperative reasons for a hearing within 72 hours in the case of a judicial commitment than where a licensed physician has found that an emergency hold was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver received several convictions for alcohol-influenced driving and his operator's license was revoked. He later petitioner for, and was granted, reinstatement of his privileges under Minn. Stat. &sect; 171.19. Apparently a clerical error resulted in the failure of the trial court to report to the Commissioner another of the driver's convictions within 10 days of the conviction, as required by Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 169.95 and 171.16. Discovering the error, the Commissioner refused to reinstate the driver's privileges. The trial court again ordered the Commissioner to reinstate privileges. The Commissioner appealed, but the court affirmed. Although the trial court erred in concluding that unless a report was made to the Commissioner within 10 days of the conviction, the Commissioner had no power to revoke a license on the basis of that conviction; the violation would have run concurrently with the other revocations and, therefore, would not have been a bar to reinstatement even if the conviction had been reported promptly.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for allegedly participating with at least two others in the armed robbery of a restaurant. Defendant, who was then 16 years old, was certified for prosecution as an adult and was charged with aggravated robbery under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.245 (1982). A jury found him guilty. Normally, the presumptive sentence for that offense by a person with defendant's criminal history score was 24 months in prison. However, the three-year minimum term provision of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11 (1982) applied. That translated into a Guidelines sentence of 54 months. The court found that defense counsel failed to persuade the prosecutor to move for sentencing without regard to the minimum three-year prison term. Defense counsel also failed to persuade the trial court that it could depart from the minimum term without a motion by the prosecutor. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but remand for resentencing. At the resentencing hearing, the parties would be able to present evidence and arguments bearing on whether this was an appropriate case for departure from the mandatory prison term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's associate gave a couple $ 600 to procure cocaine for him, but they did not deliver. To scare the couple into paying it back, defendant fired a shotgun at the couple's home. Defendant was convicted of various charges and appealed. The court affirmed the convictions, rejecting first defendant's contention that the state failed to establish that he intended by his act of shooting to put the residents in fear of immediate bodily harm. It also ruled that there was no merit to defendant's assertion that his conviction for reckless discharge of a firearm needed to be vacated under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.04 (1980). While the statute barred two convictions based on one offense and a lesser-included offense for the same act, the court ruled that reckless discharge of a firearm was not a necessarily included offense of assault with a dangerous weapon. However, the trial court erred in believing that it had no choice under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11, subd. 5 (1981) but to sentence defendant to a statutory minimum prison term for the assault. Because both the trial court and the prosecutor could initiate sentencing without regard to minimums, remand was necessary to consider mitigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator taxpayer brought an action against respondents, the State and a county, challenging property tax assessments for two years. He alleged that the classification created by Minn.

The Tax Court (Minnesota) held that the classification was constitutional. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under &sect; 273.13, subd. 19, residential real estate of four or more units was taxed at 40 percent of market value while residential real estate of less than four units compromised a second class that was taxed at 32 percent of market value. The taxpayer contended that the classification violated the uniformity clause of the state constitution and the equal protection clause of the federal constitution. On appeal of a decision holding that the classification was constitutional, the court affirmed. The taxpayer did not challenge the legitimacy of the governmental objective of affording relief to small property owners. However, he alleged that the means used by the legislature to achieve its proper purpose was constitutionally defective because there was no rational basis for the classification. The court held that the distinctions between the two classes were genuine and not fanciful. With respect to consumption of governmental services such as fire and police protection, the small and large properties were not similarly situated. The line drawn by the legislature was based on distinctions that were genuine and that had a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's arguments. Despite the existence of some testimony to the contrary, the court found, after independently evaluating the record, that the prosecution established the voluntariness of defendant's confession by a fair preponderance of the evidence. The trial court's refusal to suppress the confession was not clearly erroneous. Further, defendant had no right to present psychiatric evidence as to diminished responsibility.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant raised issues that involved his insanity defense and alleged errors at trial. Defendant's major attack on the verdict was that there was not sufficient evidence to support the jury's rejection of the mental illness defense. The court held that his contention failed in light of the established rule that the defendant bears the burden of proving mental illness. At trial, defendant requested that the jury be given instructions for felony murder and depraved mind third-degree murder. The trial court refused to charge the jury as to the latter after determining that defendant intended to shoot the particular victims who were shot. Defendant argued that this refusal deprived him of a fair trial, because, in effect, the trial court was resolving the issue of intent instead of leaving it to the jury. The court held that a depraved mind instruction would have been inappropriate, since the depraved mind statute was intended to cover cases where the reckless or wanton acts of the accused were committed without special regard to their effect on any particular person or persons.

Relators denied that the requested retraining would significantly reduce any claimed unemployability and contended that Minn.

Alternatively, they contended that &sect; 176.102, subd. 11 limited the compensation to which the employee was entitled during retraining. The compensation judge awarded the employee concurrent temporary total disability and retraining benefits. The court of appeal affirmed.

Stat. &sect; 273.02, subd. 4, which exacted an omitted property tax on newly discovered iron ore on the corporation's property. The State cross-appealed the decision that Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.02, subd. 6 was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a particular year, it was determined from a test that a certain tonnage of iron ore not previously identified was deposited in the corporation's property. Later, the State reassessed the property retroactively for six years to increase the tax for each of those years. The retroactive taxation was imposed under the Omitted Property Statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.02, subd. 4 (1980). On appeal, the court rejected the contention that the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the Uniformity Clause of Minn. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1, prohibited assessment of retroactive increases in taxes against iron ore but not other minerals. In upholding the classification, the court found that ore deposits were apparently unique in that they were hard to measure, and overruns of amounts actually mined, that was, tonnage actually realized in comparison to prior estimates, were common. The court rejected the argument that the tax was not omitted but imposed on undervalued realty reasoning that, if it were merely undervalued, the one-year statute of limitations of Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.02, subd. 2 (1980) would have applied instead of the six-year statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The broadcaster brought an action for declaratory judgment against the city for review of the city's denial of a special-use permit to construct a satellite tower or, in the alternative, a determination that there had been a taking of property without just compensation. When the district court found in favor of the city, the broadcaster sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the city's determination that the construction of the tower would have been inconsistent with the city's comprehensive development plan had evidentiary support and was within the bounds of the city's discretion in interpreting and implementing the plan. The court rejected the broadcaster's contention that a mealtime discussion of the proposed construction between two city council members constituted a violation of the open meeting law, Minn. Stat. &sect; 471.705 (1980), noting that such conversations did not constitute a meeting for the purposes of &sect; 471.705. The court found that the trial court had properly determined that the denial of the permit did not constitute a taking, noting that the denial had not deprived the property of all of its reasonable uses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were married and then moved to the father's native country of Germany where their son was born. The mother returned to the United States with the son. The trial court dissolved the marriage and awarded exclusive custody of the son to the mother. The mother sought a denial of visitation, specifically in Germany, and the attorney sought to intervene and for appointment as guardian ad litem. Both motions were denied. On appeal, the court affirmed but remanded. The court held that the trial court correctly denied the attorney's motion to intervene as it was untimely. The court had jurisdiction because the mother's request for modification of the father's visitation rights was timely and Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.175, subd. 5 (1980) permitted modification where a child's physical or emotional well-being was at issue, as was the allegedly the case with respect to forced visitation. The boy, at age nine, lacked the ability to assess the value of building an enduring relationship with his father and the boy's real fear was not of going to Germany but of being detained in Germany. As such, visitation to Germany was permitted, subject to conditions designed to ensure the son's return.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded and directed modification of the visitation conditions by the trial court, but otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was acquitted of murdering the decedent upon finding that she acted in self-defense to the decedent's rape, knifing, and death threats. Following her acquittal, she brought an action against the estate for compensatory and punitive damages. The trial court granted summary judgment on the basis that an intentional tort action did not survive the tortfeasor's death under Minn. Stat. &sect; 573.01 (1980). The victim appealed, claiming that the exclusion of intentional torts from the survival statute operated as an unconstitutional denial of equal protection. The court concluded that &sect; 573.01 failed the state's rational basis test and was therefore violative of the equal protection provision of the Minnesota Constitution. Because the statute was phrased in the negative, the court was unable to add language to it in order to render it constitutionally permissible. Accordingly, the court decided to strike the middle sentence of &sect; 573.01 to allow all causes of action to survive the death of either party, except those arising out of the death of an injured plaintiff, which was governed by the wrongful death statute.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the putative fathers contended that &sect; 257.62(1) was not proper legislation under the police power because it was primarily designed to further private interests, that the statute violated substantive due process, and that it violated their right of privacy and their right not to have their bodily integrity violated. The court upheld the constitutionality of the statute against the putative fathers' challenge. The court ruled that the state's compelling interests in determining the paternity of a child outweighed the comparatively limited interest of the putative father's right not to have his bodily integrity violated by such a test.

In 1978, citizens suffered property damage from heavy rains and in 1979 filed an action against the City alleging the negligent design and construction of the water drainage system was the proximate cause of the damage. Some 15 months later, the City impleaded the designer and the subcontractor and sought indemnification or contribution. The designer sought summary judgment and argued that 22 years had passed since the completion of the drainage system and that Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051 barred the City's claims. Summary judgment was awarded, and the City sought review and argued that that &sect; 541.051 did not apply or was unconstitutional. The court found that the City was aware of the citizens' damage before an action was filed, that the City had until August 1, 1980 to implead the designer and the subcontractor and it failed to do so, and that summary judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court concluded that there was a substantial invasion of property rights of such magnitude that the residents were deprived of the practical enjoyment of their property. There was also a reasonable probability the invasion would continue in the future. The dispute arose because the trial court also concluded that the invasion had not resulted in a definite and measurable diminution in the market value of the residents' property. Consequently, the writ was denied. On appeal the residents claimed that the evidence established their right to inverse condemnation as a matter of law, that the trial court made an incorrect evidentiary ruling and misapplied the required standard, and that, finally, they were deprived of a jury trial. While the residents had successfully opposed the commission's initial request for a jury, they claimed that was not a waiver as they were misled by language in the standard as to the jury's role in such proceedings. While the trial court properly followed the procedures and the standard, the residents were deprived of a jury trial, which they had not waived, and, therefore, a new trial was necessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Minnesota resident filed a cause of action in Minnesota against the driver for personal injury sustained in an automobile accident in Iowa. The driver was an Iowa resident. The only Minnesota asset of the driver was his insurance policy, which the Minnesota resident garnished. The driver contended that the driver lacked jurisdiction. The trial court denied the driver's motion, and the driver appealed arguing that the decision in Rush v. Savchuk, 444 U.S. 320 (1980) applied retroactively, and therefore, the trial court lacked jurisdiction. The Rush court's decision held that attachment of an insurance policy, as the way of establishing quasi-in-rem jurisdiction was unconstitutional. Reversing the trial court's judgment, the court held that the rule in Rush v. Savchuk was retroactively applicable to all cases pending in the State of Minnesota as of the date of the United States Supreme Court's decision. The court found that the decision established a new principle of law, retroactive application would retard the use of the current law allowing the attachment, and the equities in the action did not militate against retroactive application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought by plaintiff nonprofit corporation against defendant county attorney, the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota directed questions to the court: (1) whether Minn. Stat. &sect; 210A.34 (1980) permitted the establishment of a corporate political action committee (PAC); (2) whether &sect; 72A.12, subd. 5 permitted an insurance company to establish a PAC; and (3) whether &sect; 210A.34 applied to nonprofit corporations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county attorney contended that the legislature did not to prohibit conduit PACs because, although administrative expenses in PACs were valuable, the money was not expended on behalf of a particular candidate. Instead, he argued that it was expended on behalf of all candidates whom individual members wished to aid. The court concurred with the county attorney's interpretation. Several articles in local newspapers, the only evidence of the legislative intent, made clear that the legislature was seeking to eliminate the use of &quot;war chests&quot; by the brewing industry to advance their corporate interests. The occasion and necessity for the law was to emasculate corporate influence on the political process. The circumstances under which the law was enacted were a time of increased national concern over the corrupt practices and undue influence of large concentrations of corporate wealth. The mischief to be remedied was the disproportionate influence on the political process by corporate interests. Sections 210A.34, 72A.12, subd. 5 prohibited partisan PACs but did not prohibit &quot;conduit&quot; or &quot;independent&quot; PACs. The prohibitions of &sect; 210A.34 were inapplicable to nonprofit corporations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that partisan PACs were prohibited but that &quot;conduit&quot; or &quot;independent&quot; PACs were not prohibited.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 473.581(4), which prevented the city from amending the tax until the bonds were discharged, constituted special legislation as defined in Minn. Const. art. XII, &sect; 2. As special laws, the statutes could be superseded by a home rule charter amendment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state agency sought review of a judgment entered in the District Court for Hennepin County (Minnesota) that determined that a portion of Minn. Stat. &sect; 296.02 (7) (1980) was unconstitutional because it discriminated against interstate commerce by providing a tax reduction only for gasahol blended with alcohol distilled within the state from state farm products.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state agency argued that the statute at issue in this case did not violate the commerce clause as it did not discriminate against interstate commerce. The court rejected the state agency's arguments. The court found that the legislation at issue constituted simple economic protectionism and this was a per se violation of the commerce clause. The court further noted that the statute did not regulate evenhandedly and did not serve any legitimate local interests such as public safety. Thus, it did not pass the balancing test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Pike v Bruce Church Inc. The court then concluded that the appropriate remedy in this case was to invalidate the entire statute. The court found that to sever only the offending unconstitutional language would benefit only plaintiff foreign corporation and would frustrate the legislative intent set forth in the statute. The court found that it was not clear that the legislative intent was to sustain the statute in a limited application rather than to eliminate a tax otherwise valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision that determined that the statute pertaining to the taxation of the production of gasahol was unconstitutional.

In the first action, the guest was the brother to the social host who visited her sister's home.

In the second action, the guest went to a &quot;kegger&quot; at the guest's home, then drove drunk and injured the third-party. In the third action, the social host was hosting a wedding reception. The guest became drunk at the reception, then drove drunk and killed a third-party. The court affirmed the trial courts' orders. The court held that pursuant to the Minnesota Civil Damages Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.95 (1980), the legislature clearly excluded liability for a social host by deleting the previous used term &quot;giving&quot; in describing liability. Indeed, the court noted that, when considering the legislation, the Minnesota Legislature even discussed the common law rule of permitting liability against a social host under the &quot;dram shop&quot; laws, even where the host gave the alcohol free of charge to the intoxicated guest.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the disciplinary rule applicable in the U.S. Supreme Court case was substantially identical to Minn. Rules on Lawyers Prof. Resp. R. 2-101(b). The matter was whether in light of the case's differences from the U.S. Supreme Court case, whether first amendment protections would be extended to the attorneys' distribution of a letter and brochure.

The publisher argued that the use tax was unconstitutional because it violated freedom of the press. The publisher also claimed that the use tax violated the equal protection clause because small publishers and industrial users did not have to pay it. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that: (1) the legislature did not enact the use tax as a deliberate and calculated device to restrict dissemination of the news and opinions appearing in newspapers distributed by publishers; (2) the use tax was part of a general system of sales and use taxation instituted by the state; (3) by exempting industrial users from the use tax, the legislature exempted industrial users from the use tax because they paid sales taxes, unlike the publisher; and (4) the tax did not violate the First Amendment or the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

The court held the evidence of maintenance to be substantially less than necessary and concluded that the trial court was clearly erroneous in finding that the maintenance requirement of Minn. Stat. &sect; 160.05 was satisfied. The court also concluded that the trial court erred in not applying the Marketable Title Act to the township's claim. The critical fact was that the township's claim to the road was unrecorded. Therefore, subd. 5 of the Act operated to impose a conclusive presumption of abandonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action arose from an incident whereby a commercial vehicle, insured by the indemnity company, collided with a van and impelled the van into a station wagon. The van and the station wagon were insured by the casualty company. The drivers and passengers of the van and station wagon were injured. The casualty company sought indemnity from the indemnity company under Minn. Stat. &sect; 65B.53(1) (1978). The indemnity company declined to arbitrate and brought its constitutional claim. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's judgment was correct. The court stated that &sect; 65B.53 was directly responsive to the stated objectives of the Minnesota No-Fault Automobile Insurance Act in that it provided for indemnity from insurers of commercial vehicles. The court found that the classification of commercial vehicles was permissible because commercial vehicles tended to cause more damage in collisions and they were on the roads more often. The court concluded that &sect; 65B.53(4) was not unconstitutional because the right to indemnity was an equitable claim and there was no right to a jury trial on equitable claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that certain provisions of the Act violated the separation-of-powers doctrine by ordering courts to perform functions which, if a court performed them, created the appearance that the court had become a biased advocate for one party in a dispute.

Thereafter, a petition for termination of their parental rights was filed. The trial court ordered termination but stayed the order. The trial court directed the parents to abstain from alcohol, visit regularly with the children, stay in the same residence, and maintain steady employment or vocational training. Three months later, the trial court resumed the hearing. The trial court found that the parents had continued drinking, missed half of their scheduled visits with their children, had a history of instability and that they were unable to provide care and nurture for the children. Thus, the trial court vacated the stay. On appeal by the father, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court ruled that the father could not raise a constitutional challenge to Minn. Stat. &sect; 260.221(b)(4) (1976) because he had not raised it in the trial court or notified the attorney general of the challenge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged an order of the Lake County District Court (Minnesota), which held that the taconite tailings tax, Minn. Stat. &sect; 298.24, subd. 2 (1980) was a bill of attainder and an impairment of contract, contrary to the federal constitution and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and violated the separation of powers doctrine under the federal constitution and Minn. Const. art. III. Respondent producer brought the declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature in 1963, and the people of Minnesota in 1964, approved legislation that became known as the taconite amendment, Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 6. The producer challenged the taconite tailings tax enacted by the legislature effective after June 30, 1977. The court affirmed the trial court's finding that the tailings tax was an excise tax subject to the limitations on the taxation of taconite production imposed by Minn. Stat. &sect; 298.40, subd. 1 (1980) and by Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 6. In reversing the remainder of the trial court's judgment, the court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 298.24, subd. 2 was not a bill of attainder because the tax could apply to a legitimate class of tailing producers, there was no intent to punish, and no actual punishment was imposed. Section 298.24 did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because there was no purpose apparent on the face of the statute except to impose a tax on producers who did not operate in compliance with the statute.&nbsp;Section 298.24 did not impair the contract between the producer and the State because it did not contract away the legislature's right to tax; it only accorded to taconite producers a favorable tax status.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that the taconite tailing tax was unconstitutional as a bill of attainder and as an impairment of contract, and that it violated the separation of powers doctrine. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court insofar as it held that the tailings tax was an excise tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant trooper was denied a leave of absence to run for the office of sheriff and was told that, in order to run, he had to resign. He filed a suit in the District Court, Ramsey County (Minnesota), against appellee State charging that the &quot;resign to run&quot; rule violated his 1st and 14th Amendment rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To determine whether the &quot;resign to run&quot; rule in the collective bargaining agreement violated the trooper's right to equal protection, the character of the classification, the importance of the individual interests at stake, and the state interests asserted in support of the classification had to be examined. The Supreme Court of Minnesota held that application of that test to the &quot;resign to run&quot; rule required that it be declared unconstitutional. The &quot;resign to run&quot; rule established at least two classifications. It distinguished between state troopers running for the office of sheriff and other law enforcement officers running for that position and also differentiated between troopers running for the office of sheriff and troopers running for other offices. Those groups were similarly situated yet were treated differently. The state did have a compelling interest in the promotion of harmony and cooperation between the state highway patrol and the office of sheriff. However, the &quot;resign to run&quot; policy was not the least restrictive means available to accomplish the state's goal; requiring the trooper to take an unpaid leave of absence was the least restrictive method.</SPAN></P>

The Attorney General alleged that the security firm acted as an agent for the retail employer in soliciting or requiring polygraph examinations and disclosing the results in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 181.75, 181.76 (1980). The retail employer and the security firm filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the two statutes were unconstitutional. The district court denied the motion for summary judgment and certified questions as to the constitutionality of the statutes to the court. The court held that &sect; 181.75 and &sect; 181.76 did not infringe upon First Amendment commercial speech freedoms on account of overbreadth or vagueness, and that the statutes did not constitute a deprivation of property without due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, appellants, several injury victims, challenged the judgments of the District Courts (Minnesota), which dismissed their claims against respondents, various tortfeasors, for failure to either serve timely notice of their dram shop claims or to initiate their actions within the statute of limitations set forth in Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.951 (1980).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants brought suits pursuant to the Minnesota Dram Shop Act (Act), Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.95 (1980), for damages suffered in automobile accidents caused by the illegal sale of liquor to respondents. In each case, the trial courts granted summary judgment or judgment on the pleadings in respondents' favor for failure to either serve timely notice of their dram shop claims or to initiate their actions within the statute of limitations. State law recognized a six-year statute of limitations for negligent vendors of 3.2 beer, but other intoxicating liquor vendors were protected by the one-year statute of limitations and notice provisions of the Act. The court reversed and remanded for trial because the Act could not pass rational basis review. The Act unconstitutionally protected different classes of claimants unequally because the classifications, sale of 3.2 beer versus sale of intoxicating liquor, were not genuine or relevant to the purpose of the law. The distinctions which separated the classes were arbitrary. There was no rational basis for distinguishing between persons injured by those intoxicated from drinking 3.2 beer and those intoxicated from drinking stronger liquor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer found the driver inside a pickup truck seated behind and leaning against the steering wheel. Another officer arrived on the scene. After the driver failed a number of field sobriety tests and a preliminary screening test, they concluded that he was intoxicated and arrested him. His driver's license was revoked pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.123, subd. 5 (1980). The trial court found that he did not violate Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.121, subd. 1(a) because the DPS did not prove that he was in physical control of the truck and rescinded the revocation order. The two-judge majority of the court of appeals affirmed on the ground that the preliminary screening test was improperly administered. On appeal, the court reversed. Because &sect; 169.121 had to be construed broadly in the public's favor, the court held that the driver exercised the necessary control to violate &sect; 169.121, even though it was unclear whether the truck's motor was running. The court found that the officers had specific and articulable facts as a basis to believe that the driver had been driving, operating, or controlling his truck while under the influence of an intoxicating beverage.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the State was not subject to the creditors' claim because the legislature did not appropriate money to fund the purchase of the ride, and the court affirmed. The State could not be required to pay money from its general fund for the ride until the legislature appropriated funds for that purpose. In the absence of an appropriation, any law which created a liability on the part of the State was of no force. However, the trial court held that the State was in default, which entitled the creditors to the default remedies set out in the contract.

The carrier mistakenly issued a check to the claimant for additional permanent partial disability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant sustained an injury admittedly arising out of and in the course of her employment in February 1973. In 1975, the carrier made an overpayment to the claimant. The claimant raised Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.179 (1974) as a defense. The statute stated that an overpayment would not be refunded if it was voluntary, paid in accordance with the Workers' Compensation Act, and accepted by the employee in good faith. The carrier claimed that the statute did not apply because it was effective in 1974 and the claimant was injured in 1973. In affirming the trial court's decision, the court held that the statute was applicable and valid. Although the law in effect on the date of an injury governed an employee's right to compensation and an employer's liability for it, the principle did not apply to the claimant's case because &sect; 176.179 neither enlarged an employee's right to receive compensation nor increased an employer's liability to pay it. The fact that the mistaken payment was made subsequent to the effective date of the statute similarly destroyed the carrier's argument that its application resulted in an impairment of a contract obligation in violation of Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company wished to develop a 620-acre plat to build seasonal, recreational homes. A summary of the letter to voters stated that the ordinance sought to be adopted would allow only one single family dwelling per quarter-quarter section. An interim zoning ordinance was adopted limiting the density of dwellings to one residence per quarter-quarter section. The county planning commission rejected the company's plat on the ground that it did not comply with the interim zoning ordinance. Ultimately, the trial court declared the interim zoning ordinance invalid because the board exceeded its authority in extending the duration of the ordinance. The township then adopted a permanent ordinance, which was also found to be invalid because the board exceeded its authority in adopting the ordinance on a less than 70 percent vote. The court found that the issue of the kind of voting authority conferred by the voters on the board was determined under the first judgment. Having failed to appeal the first judgment, the township was bound by the trial court's decision that the township's zoning fell under Minn.

The insured's father maintained a policy of insurance issued by the insurer that covered the insured. The policy provided uninsured motorist coverage. During settlement negotiations, both parties assumed that &quot;stacking&quot; was unavailable as to the uninsured coverage, and a settlement figure was reached based in part on that assumption. The parties settled for a sum that was less than the policy limits, and a district court approved the settlement. Subsequently, &quot;stacking&quot; was permitted in Minnesota, and the insured filed a petition to vacate the former settlement. The trial court denied the requested relief, and the court affirmed. It held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to vacate the settlement because no mutual mistake of fact, misrepresentation, or other ground justifying a setting aside of the settlement existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, a barber and a cosmetologist, sought a judicial declaration that trade regulation statutes,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 186.01 (1980) and Minn. Stat. &sect; 154.03 (1980), were unconstitutional. The District Court, Ramsey County (Minnesota), invalidated the closing hour regulations and statutory apprentice rules on equal protection grounds and sustained the trade area regulations. Appellant Governor appealed. The barber filed a notice of review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first issue was whether the challenged regulations, which imposed upon barbers more stringent standards than those required of cosmetologists, were constitutionally defective. In view of the fact that barbers and cosmetologists were similarly situated, the Supreme Court of Minnesota held that the regulations deemed necessary to the orderly functioning of the barbers should have been equally applicable to the cosmetologists unless a rational basis for a distinction existed. The governor argued that the imposition of more stringent operational restrictions upon the smaller, more sophisticated profession was justified. Those alleged distinctions were not genuine and substantial and they failed to account for the similarity of training, experience, and commitment practiced by the hairstylists. Minn. Stat. &sect; 186.01 (1980) was enacted to deter unfair trade practices and unfair competition and to promote public health considerations in all personal trades. It was without merit to argue that that statute, which by its terms applied to both professions, required the imposition of regulations upon barbers alone to effectuate its purpose. The trial court did not err in its holding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court, as to the closing hour regulations, the statutory apprentice rule, and the denial of attorney fees, was affirmed, but the trial court's order sustaining the validity of the trade areas was reversed.</SPAN></P>

A determination of third-party credit was then made administratively. The appellate court vacated the administrative determination, and the employer sought review. The court held that the district court had the exclusive jurisdiction to apportion the proceeds of a wrongful death action settlement. However, notice of the apportionment should have been given to the employer because it had a workers' compensation subrogation interest to protect. In addition, Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.061, subd. 8 (1980), which provided that failure to provide the State, as an employer, with notice of a settlement between an employee and a third-party tortfeasor, was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustees commenced a wrongful death action against the city, the state, state agencies, and defendant hotel owner after the decedents were killed in a fire at the hotel. The trustees alleged that the state and its agencies failed to enforce proper fire safety measures at the hotel and that this failure directly contributed to the death of the decedents. The trial court granted summary judgment to the city, the state, and its agencies. The trustees appealed. The court held that the state could only be liable for negligent omissions if it owed a special duty to a particular class of persons. Minn. Stat. &sect; 299F.46, subd. 2 (1976) established general fire inspection and fire code enforcement requirements that were applicable to hotels.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By writ of certiorari, relator taxpayers sought review of a decision of the Tax Court of Minnesota, which agreed with respondent Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue and determined that Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.01, subd. 20 (1978) limited the deduction for contributions to self-employment retirement plans to a maximum of $ 2,500 for the taxable year ending December 31, 1974.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers deducted the total amount of their contribution on their 1974 individual income tax returns in arriving at their federal adjusted gross income. The Minnesota revenue department conducted an audit and reduced the deduction allowed for payments to a self-employment retirement plan to $ 2,500, the amount permitted under I.R.C. &sect; 404(c)(1) prior to and on December 31, 1973. The taxpayers argued that the legislature intended the 1974 federal amendments, which raised the maximum deduction to $ 7,500, to apply for 1974 state tax purposes. The tax court disagreed. On review, the court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.01, subd. 20(iii), (iv) (1978) clearly provided that for the taxable year ending December 31, 1974, the federal tax laws that were in effect on December 31, 1973 applied for Minnesota income tax purposes. Thus, the taxpayers were limited to a $ 2,500 deduction. One taxpayer also argued that &sect; 290.01, subd. 20 was a denial of equal protection because the state taxed no other retirement income except that of self-employed persons. The court held that there was no denial of equal protection because all self-retirement plans were treated equally.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first appeal, the court found that the row houses were a historical resource within the meaning of the Minnesota Environmental Rights Act, Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 116B.01-.13 (1980). In reversing and remanding the decision, the court held that the injunction that it had previously directed the trial court to issue was to remain in full force and effect to prohibit the demolition of the row houses until such time as the Minnesota legislature had an opportunity to address the problems surfaced by the litigation. If the legislature failed to take corrective measures, defendants could apply to the trial court for an order dissolving the injunction, unless by that time plaintiffs had been able to propose and implement some other appropriate remedy. The court noted that in its previous opinion it had strongly recommended that the relevant legislative or administrative bodies initiate condemnation proceedings with regard to the row houses within a reasonable period of time. The owners could not be forced to renovate their property nor could they be enjoined indefinitely from demolishing the row houses if no other solution could be reached.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the father's paternity was established, he was ordered to pay child support. The father argued that Minn.

Rejecting these arguments, the court upheld the trial court's ruling. The court concluded that &sect; 157.251established a statutory requirement of support for illegitimate children by a father that paralleled the common law requirement of support by a mother, thus making the duty of support coextensive. The statute did not create a gender-based classification. The court overruled any prior decisions that required or established gender-based distinctions between the support responsibilities of fathers and mothers of illegitimate children. As for the challenge based on marital status, the court dismissed it as being predicated on the father's false assumption that the statute treated mothers of illegitimate children differently than fathers of illegitimate children, thus creating the appearance of a distinction between the way parents of legitimate children were treated in divorce cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was disciplined for making three derogatory remarks about certain areas of the city. One of the remarks referred to the residents' American Indian heritage in a derogatory manner. After being notified that he was being discharged, he requested and was given a hearing before three civil service commissioners. The commissioners dismissed one charge, but concluded that he violated Rule 12.02(j) and suspended him for 90 days. The employee filed a complaint alleging that Rule 12.02(j) was unconstitutional. The parties filed motions for summary judgment and trial court granted the city's motion. On appeal, the court affirmed the order in part and reversed it in part. The First Amendment did not give absolute protection from disciplinary action based on statements uttered by a public employee while in the course of his business. The city had a special interest as an employer, which overrode the interest of the employee in making the one racist remark, but not the other two remarks. The court found that Rule 12.02(j) was neither vague nor overbroad and, therefore, the employee could have been disciplined under it for the racist remark.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An appeal was filed from the trial court's order setting aside the Commission's determination that 13 percent was the proper return on equity, its approval of the Commission's rate allocation, and its denial of an expense allowance on a utility project and a generating plant. The court affirmed with modification. The court held that the trial court properly found that there was no substantial evidence supporting the Commission's rate of 13 percent. The court ruled that the trial court inappropriately took judicial notice of the company's stock offering, which occurred after the Commission's hearing order. Subsequent events should not have been considered in reviewing the appropriateness of the Commission's order. The court affirmed that part of the judgment supporting the Commission's rate allocation, and the rejection of the allowance of construction costs for the utility project and the generating plant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city sought to change the source of its municipal water supply. The DNR granted the city permission to develop two wells in an aquifer that the company also sought to use. The DNR denied the company's applications until it was able to show no adverse impact on higher priority users. The company challenged the DNR's order as effecting an unconstitutional taking of private property without just compensation, as violative of certain statutory mandates, and as arbitrary and capricious. The trial court affirmed the DNR's order, and on appeal, the court also affirmed. The court rejected the company's contention that the permit granted to the city constituted a taking. The court determined that until it was clear that the city's water use deprived the company of water it needed, the company's claim was premature. The court found that because no pumping or depletion of the groundwater supply had yet occurred, any damages to be awarded were therefore speculative. The court noted that the permit granted to the city contained a provision that the city would have to obtain an owner's written consent if any action by the city would result in a taking of the owner's property rights.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 290.09, subd. 29 (1978). The farm loss modification law was held to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner audited the taxpayers' state income tax returns for 1975 and 1976. He issued an assessment, ruling that the taxpayers should have applied the farm loss modification law, Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.09, subd. 29 (1978). The Tax Court reversed the order, ruling that &sect; 290.09, subd. 29 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the judgment of the Tax Court was reversed. The court determined that &sect; 290.09, subd. 29 met the statutory classification against the equal protection requirement, because the classifications were genuine and relevant to the purpose of the law. The use of non-farm income to distinguish between two classes of farm income taxpayers was not manifestly arbitrary or fanciful, but provided a reasonable basis for the classification. The court ruled that under &sect; 290.09, subd. 29, the taxpayers were able to take approximately 54 percent of their claimed 1975 farm losses and 63 percent of their claimed 1976 losses. Finally, the court concluded that the statute did not offend either the equal protection clause or the uniformity clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three real estate tax assessments cases the court found that the tax classification contained in Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.11(2) had a rational basis and that the taxpayers' challenge on equal protection grounds based on Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1, that the application resulted in discriminatory and unequal distribution of property taxes, failed. The gradual implementation of tax increases promoted stability in ownership by giving property owners time to adjust to and make provisions for the increases. The court held that the tax court had the jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of tax statutes when the constitutional issue was raised in the district court before the case was transferred to the tax court. The court remanded one taxpayer's assessment because the deliberate treatment of houses valued over $ 100,000 was discriminatory and adopted the average percentage of undervaluation of a given class of property as the appropriate means of relief in unequal assessment cases. The court remanded another taxpayer's assessment for a reconsideration of its valuation because the trial court was not free to adopt valuation figures higher than those assessed by the assessor.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court rejected defendant's first two arguments. The information leading to defendant's arrest came from a known informant who dealt directly with defendant. While the police were outside their jurisdiction when they arrested defendant, the arrest was lawful under Minn. Stat. &sect; 629.37, the citizen's arrest statute. The court concurred with defendant's claim that the lower court erred in failing to suppress evidence of marijuana taken without his permission from the locked trunk of his automobile. There were no exigent circumstances to justify this warrantless search because defendant was in the police station at the time. He had no chance to flee in his automobile.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased infant experienced numerous problems after birth, but those problems had been resolved. He died as a result of receiving an intravenous feeding intended for an adult but mislabeled as appropriate for an infant. The hospital admitted liability. The parents filed their action. At trial, the baby's neonatology specialist testified that the infant would have had a 95 percent chance of living as a normal baby. The jury awarded damages to the parents that the trial court substantially reduced. The county filed an unsuccessful motion for a new trial. Both parties appealed. The court ruled that the parents were not estopped from recovering more than the amount prayed for in their complaint. It was not error to find that the verdict was excessive, however, and the trial court's reduction of the award to an amount close to what the parents asked for in their complaint was also not error. The closing argument of the parents' attorney was not inappropriate. The trial court properly told the jury that that they were to determine the amount that would fairly compensate the parents for the pecuniary loss resulting from the death of their son and not the value of his life.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant's language, under the circumstances, constituted fighting words, because it was directed at and was intended to be about a particularly person, could readily have been found by a jury to be inherently likely to incite violence, and defendant was directly insulting and intimidating an innocent person.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A deputy sheriff contacted the county attorney and told him of information he had obtained that established probable cause to believe marijuana would be found at a certain residence, but haste was required to obtain a warrant before the possessor left town. The county attorney called the judge and sought telephonic authorization for a search warrant. Thereafter, a conference call between the judge, deputy, and county attorney was arranged. The deputy then signed the affidavit, which had been prepared by the county attorney, in the presence of a witness, and the judge, determining that there was probable cause, delegated the duty of signing his name to the warrant to the deputy. Thereafter, defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to sell. On appeal, she contended that the search warrant that resulted in the discovery of the evidence violated her U.S. Const. amend. IV rights because the judge had not personally signed the warrant. The court affirmed, upholding the constitutionality of the procedures and found that the requirement in Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 626.05 and 626.11 (1978) that the issuing judge sign the warrant was a purely ministerial task.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction on the grounds that his request for a lesser included offense instruction was denied and that accomplice testimony was not sufficiently corroborated. The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that no rational basis existed on which a jury could have found defendant not guilty of third degree murder, as armed robbery was undoubtedly a crime against the person within the meaning of &sect; 609.195(2) (1978). The court found that if an instruction on first degree manslaughter had been given, there would have been no criterion on which the jury could have relied in determining which of the two offenses defendant committed. Because the underlying felony was a crime against the person, a lesser included offense instruction was not appropriate. The court also found that the accomplices' testimony was adequately corroborated by independent testimony and that error, if any, in failing to instruct the jury that a witness was an accomplice as a matter of law was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission found that the landlord illegally discriminated against the complainant because of his American Indian heritage, but the trial court reversed the decision. On appeal, the issues raised were whether the filing of an affidavit of prejudice in an action to review an agency decision required that the case be reassigned, whether the decision of the commission was supported by substantial evidence, and whether proceedings by the commission were barred by an adverse jury verdict on the defense of discrimination in an unlawful detainer proceeding. The court held that the affidavit of prejudice should have been honored and that the remedy afforded in civil cases, which were reversal and a new trial, should be applied. The court found that the failure to honor the affidavit was reversible error requiring a new trial. The court held that the trial court erroneously believed that it was in the role of an appellate judge rather than as a trial court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator taxpayer challenged an order of the Minnesota Tax Court, which accepted the taxpayer's claim that its real property was improperly assessed at greater than its market value, but concluded that the facts did not support the taxpayer's allegation of unequal assessment under Minn. Stat. &sect; 278.01 (1978), Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1, and U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal issue raised on appeal was whether the data presented in a study commissioned by the taxpayer raised a presumption that the property was assessed at a level that violated the taxpayer's rights. The taxpayer claimed that Minn. Stat. &sect; 278.01 (1978) established a less rigorous burden than would otherwise be required to sustain a claim for relief under the federal and state constitutions. The court held that the taxpayer's study relied on an incomplete list of commercial property sales, assumed incorrectly that sales prices automatically equaled market value, and determined the ratio of sale price to assessed value without verifying the actual value of the properties surveyed. In the court's view, the most that the study showed was that the tax assessor might have made an error of judgment. In the court's view, the information in the taxpayer's study did not establish a prima facie case or raise a presumption of unfairness justifying relief. Further, the court held that its prior decisions did not support the taxpayer's claim that a dual standard, one constitutional and the other statutory, was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The developer filed an action against appellants to estop enforcement of ch. 306 against it. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the developer, and appellants sought review.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the amphetamine was erroneously admitted because it was seized in a warrantless search of his apartment in alleged violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.

The court held that a probation officer must have thorough up-to-date knowledge of a probationer's personal habits, relationships, and activities. Although the court conceded that probation searches fell within the ambit of the Fourth Amendment and had to comport with a standard of reasonableness, the court also recognized that, because of the special relationship between the probation officer and probationer, the law relating to probation searches could not be strictly governed by automatic reference to ordinary search and seizure law. The court cited the pervasiveness of the regulation to which the probationer was subject, the lowered expectation of privacy of the probationer, and the demands of the probation relationship as reasons justifying a warrantless search by a probation officer.</SPAN></P>

The employer argued that the employee did not sustain simultaneous injuries. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the double disabilities schedule contained no provisions applicable to the employee's disabilities. Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.101, subd. 3(28) provided compensation for the loss of two arms other than at the shoulder, and Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.101, subd. 3(30) provided compensation for the loss of two legs, other than so close to the hips that no effective artificial member could be used. While Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.101, subd. 3 (37) provided compensation for the loss of one arm and one leg, that provision also did not accurately describe the employee's disabilities and it was clear that by doubling the compensation due him, that the employee had indeed sustained simultaneous injuries to his back and his limbs, and that the compensation to be awarded therefor was properly computed pursuant to &sect;&sect; 176.101, subd. 3(14), (19), and (42).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An airport was situated adjacent to the landowners' property. Pursuant to regulations adopted by the board, part of the landowners' property was designated as safety zones, which in effect restricted the uses to which the landowners' property could be put. The landowners filed an action against defendants seeking a writ of mandamus compelling the institution of eminent domain proceedings or in the alternative an injunction. The trial court issued the writ, and defendants appealed. The court reversed and remanded. The court agreed that the landowners were entitled to compensation; however, mandamus was inappropriate relief. Where land use regulations, such as the airport zoning regulation here, were designed to benefit a specific public or governmental enterprise, there had to be compensation to landowners whose property suffered a substantial and measurable decline in market value as a result of the regulations. Mandamus was inappropriate here because an injunction was an adequate remedy at law. The damage suffered by the landowners was not irreversible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city levied a special assessment against the company's land pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 429.021, 429.051 (1978). The company was required to pay a larger amount per acre than others. On appeal from the trial court's dismissal of the action, the court reversed and remanded with instructions to the trial court to make an independent finding on the special benefits issue. The court found that although the city's determination of a special assessment was due a presumption of validity, the trial court was required to make an independent review of the determination when a party presented contrary, competent evidence that the assessment was greater than the increase in the value of the property resulting from the improvement. When the company showed that there was evidence that the assessment may have exceeded the special benefits to the property, the presumption of validity was overcome, and an independent review was required. The court found that the testimony of the company's professional real estate appraisers was more than sufficient to overcome the city's prima facie case that the assessment did not exceed the special benefit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the evidence did not demonstrate that the officers had a right to stop defendants.

The evidence showed that police officer pursued the brothers' car after observing it driving slowly. Suspecting the driver of being intoxicated, the officers signaled, but defendants did not stop immediately and fled the scene. The court found that the evidence was more than sufficient for the officers to stop defendants based upon the officers' regular observation of intoxicated drivers in the area where defendants where sighted and defendants acts after they were sited. Defendants challenged the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.50, the obstruction statute, but the court found that the argument was waived because it was not raised until appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The real property that was the subject of the action was designated a public square on the city plat. From 1856 until the case commenced, the property has been maintained by the city and used as a public park. The city wanted to sell the property to a private developer. The city commenced an action, seeking a judgment determining it to be the owner of the property in fee simple absolute without restraint. Respondents opposed. Then the legislature enacted a statute specifically authorizing the city to sell the public square property. The trial court determined that the city did not own the property in fee simple absolute and issued the injunction requested by respondents. On appeal, the court held that the public square property must be treated as belonging to the dedicator or its successors in interest. The city had only such an interest in the property as was necessary to fulfill the property's purpose as a public square. The court also determined that in authorizing the city to sell the public square property, the statute effected a taking of private property without just compensation in violation of Minn.

The trade association and two individual companies appealed from a judgment of the district court upholding the constitutionality of the statutory scheme and argued that Minn. Stat. &sect; 238.07 (1978), as applied, resulted in discriminatory taxation of the other companies in violation of Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. The court agreed and reversed the judgment of the district court. The court noted that due to the operation of 47 C.F.R. &sect; 76.31 (1978), the trade association was not collecting any funds from the six systems because each of them paid five percent of its annual gross subscriber revenues to the franchising municipality in which it was located. The court stated that it considered it manifestly improper for the six companies to be relieved of a burden imposed on the other companies where the burden was legislatively intended to be borne by all the companies in an equitable manner.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee died after sustaining a personal injury arising out of his employment. He left surviving the widow and two children. The family also received monthly social security benefits, and the employer and insurer argued that the receipt of such benefits made the family ineligible to receive worker's compensation. The compensation judge held that the widow did not receive benefits as a survivor, but rather as custodian for the children. Therefore, he awarded full workers' compensation benefits to the widow but no benefits to the children and allowed the employer and insurer a credit for benefits already paid to the children. The Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals affirmed the compensation judge. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court noted that Minn.

The post-conviction court concluded, and the court agreed that the inmate was not deprived of a speedy trial.

The real property owners announced their contention to compel the utility company to condemn a fee interest in their land under &sect; 114C.63, subd. 4. In response, the utility company challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 114C.63, subd. 4. The court held pursuant to &sect; 116C.63, subd. 4 that the utility company, utilizing the power of eminent domain to take easements for the purpose of erecting high voltage transmission lines, had to acquire fee interests in commercially viable parcels designated by fee owners and situated contiguously to such right-of-ways.

The trial court permitted them to introduce the testimony of neighbors who had expressed concern over the problem of stray dogs but prohibited evidence of any losses sustained. On review, defendants contended that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict because the jury had considered both reasons for defendants' activities. The court found no evidence of prejudice to defendants under Minn. R. Evid. 403 by the exclusion of evidence of loss because the jury had heard testimony of the problem with stray dogs from defendants' neighbors. The court found that the statute was not unconstitutional because it was not aimed at an innocent person protecting his property, and it was obvious that the jury had rejected defendants' testimony.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers petitioned for a writ of prohibition, requesting that the tax court be restrained from determining their case. In denying the writ, the court concluded that, by providing power to the district court to transfer tax matters to the tax court, the legislature did not encroach upon the district court's original jurisdiction. Because the power was discretionary, the decision to hear a case or transfer it was entirely that of the district court. Further, because the taxpayers had the right to appeal any determination of the tax court, the statute permitting transfer did not usurp judicial functions or deprive the taxpayers of their constitutional rights and was thus not an impermissible delegation of judicial authority by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff stadium opponents and defendants, professional sports team, city, and stadium authority, agreed to an expedited trial of plaintiffs' challenge to construction of a stadium, including an abbreviated appeal period of three days. The parties requested that filings in the trial court be simultaneously filed with the court consistent with the conferral of special original jurisdiction under Minn. Stat. &sect; 473.597. The court denied the request and held that the grant of original jurisdiction was contrary to the trial court's jurisdiction under Minn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 3. On the fourth day after the trial court's decision, defendants filed a motion under the court's appellate jurisdiction for a determination that plaintiff's right to appeal had expired in accordance with the pretrial stipulation. Plaintiffs argued lack of consideration for their agreement. The court ruled that the right to appeal was a waivable privilege, that counsel's oral representation to the court was a solemn obligation which was fulfilled without regard to the requirements of commercial contracts, and that relief therefrom required the same strict showing as that for vacation of a default judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied parties' request for simultaneous filings with the court because original jurisdiction was constitutionally in the trial court, despite legislative grant of special jurisdiction to the court. The court also refused relief for plaintiff stadium opponents from their stipulated three-day appeal period because counsel's oral agreement in court was binding in the absence of the strict showing required for vacating a default judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the affidavit in support of the application for the search warrant used in the case failed to establish probable cause to search his residence and also that the six-day delay in executing the warrant violated his statutory rights under Minn.

Although the affidavit referred to hearsay information provided by an unidentified police informant, the court held that it was adequate because it contained sufficient information obtained by independent police observation to establish probable cause. Furthermore, the information was sufficient to reasonably support an inference that the marijuana would be found in a search of defendant's house. The six-day delay, which was attributable in significant part to the executing officer's desire to be sure that defendant was home when he executed the warrant, did not violate defendant's statutory or constitutional rights. The delay was not unreasonable and defendant was not prejudiced because he was in the business of selling drugs and had been doing it on a continuing basis.

The court determined that the children's dependence on the recipient for their daily food, shelter, and supervision had been essentially eliminated. Consequently, the two children were not living with the recipient for the purpose of any AFDC eligibility based on their dependency. The court further concluded that no special education needs required the children's enrollment at the center, which focused instead on behavioral problems affecting more than their schooling.

On the issue of damages, the trial court instructed the jury that it was to consider the applicable zoning ordinance, which prohibited a mobile home park on the owner's property. The owner alleged that he was entitled to a new trial based on that instruction. The court found that the reduction of value in the property was not an appropriate test for the validity of the rezoning.

Stat. &sect; 176.021, subd. 3 (1974) in three separate cases involving findings regarding injuries to appellees, a plywood lifter, a highway construction worker, and an ammonia tank filler.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employers and insurers argued that the statute unconstitutionally interfered with employer-insurer due process rights by providing that permanent partial disability benefits were payable concurrently with temporary or permanent total disability benefits. The court found that: (1) the impairment of function was compensable for its own sake in the form of damages separate and distinct from wage loss and the statute, when limited to prospective effect, was a constitutional statute serving the goal of spreading the cost of industrial injuries; (2) the statute still required proof of work-related injury, preserved all statutory defenses, and provided a fixed schedule for amounts recoverable; (3) the finding of simultaneous injury with respect to the plywood lifter was proper where the disabilities occurred shortly after the injury and there was no intervening cause; (4) the findings with respect to the highway construction worker were proper; and (5) the evidence did not support the finding of a head injury to the ammonia tank filler and simultaneous injury provisions did not apply to internal organs or the emotional system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, manufacturers and associations, appealed from an order of the District Court, Ramsey County (Minnesota), which entered judgment for defendants, State of Minnesota, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), and Director of the MPCA, in plaintiffs' action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, challenging constitutionality and validity of the Package Review Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 116F.06, and Minn. Regs. SR-1 to SR-6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, plaintiffs broadly challenged on constitutional grounds the regulatory scheme of Minn. Stat. &sect; 116F , which dealt with materials that entered the solid waste stream and with the recycling of materials. Plaintiffs also contended that some of Minn. Regs. SR-1 to SR-6 that the MPCA adopted were contrary to legislative intent under &sect; 116F.06. The trial court entered judgment for defendants, and plaintiffs appealed. Upon review, the court affirmed as to the constitutional challenge, but reversed as to legislative intent claim. The court held that the statutory scheme did not impose an undue burden on interstate commerce because the burden imposed by the package review process was not excessive in relation to the legitimate state interest undergirding the regulatory scheme. The court also rejected the claim that the statute and regulations were unconstitutionally vague, finding that the challenge was not yet ripe. However, the court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 116F.06 lacked a specific provision which authorized the MPCA to promulgate regulations with the force and effect of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment to the extent that it held that the Package Review Act was constitutional, but reversed the judgment of the trial court to the extent that it upheld the validity of the regulations that were promulgated by the MPCA, holding that the regulations did not have the force of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act stated that the use of nonreturnable, nonrefillable containers for the packaging of milk and other milk products presented a solid waste management problem for the state, promoted energy waste and depleted natural resources. The Act stated that the use of such containers therefore should be discouraged and that the use of returnable and reusable packaging for the same products was preferred and should be encouraged. The corporations argued that the Act was unconstitutional because it created a classification in which paper containers were to be preserved while plastic nonrefillables were to be banned. The court agreed and held that the Act violated the Equal Protection Clause because it established a classification that was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest. The court held that the evidence demonstrated that plastic nonrefillables presented fewer solid waste problems than paper containers, and that the production of plastic nonrefillables did not require any more energy. The court held that drawing a distinction between plastic nonrefillables and paper containers was not reasonably related to the state's interest in preventing energy waste.</SPAN></P>

The court also ruled that defendants were entitled to a jury trial. The court held that the exemption was deficient in that by providing total immunity for particular groups and institutions regardless of their use of the material or the context in which it was used, respondent city created arbitrary and over-broad classifications, which had little relevance to the exemption's ultimate purpose.

Imposition of sentence was stayed for 10 years on the condition that defendant be treated by the Minnesota Department of Public Welfare (DPW) under the Minnesota Sex Offender Act. After treatment and various postconviction proceedings, the trial court continued defendant's commitment with the DPW and vacated defendant's 10-year probationary sentence to the commissioner of corrections. The State challenged the trial court's order vacating the 10-year probationary sentence, and defendant made various constitutional challenges to the Act. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court found no violation of due process or equal protection in the procedures used to commit appellant to the DPW. It refused to decide the constitutionality of a transfer from the DPW institution to prison and held that, although the trial court could vacate defendant's probationary sentence, it was not required to do so. Because the trial court apparently vacated the sentence under a mistaken interpretation of the law, the court remanded the case to allow the trial court to reconsider its decision.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. It found that the trial court did not err when it reviewed the decision of the taxing authority because when assessments were challenged on constitutional grounds, decisions had to be based upon independent consideration of all the evidence. It further found that the improvement did not confer a special benefit upon the property and did not enhance the market value of the taxpayer's property. Furthermore, the city's assertions that the market value would increase in the future were too speculative.

The wife was injured in a Minnesota car accident and brought a personal injury action in the state. The trial court granted summary judgment to the insured, after applying Minnesota law and declaring the policy exclusion void. The insurer appealed and asserted that the trial court erred in failing to apply Florida law, which allowed the exclusion. In affirming, the court held that there was sufficient contact with Minnesota to meet conflict of law due process requirements. The accident occurred in Minnesota, involved an collision with a Minnesota driver, and the action was tried in the state. The wife's medical damages were also incurred in the state. Other policy considerations did not require the application of Florida law. By their nature automobile insurance policies provided multi-state coverage and the insured's policy did not specify that Florida law would govern suits filed in other states. Predictability of results was, therefore, not a concern. The intra-family liability exclusion violated Minnesota law and the Minnesota courts could not be required to enforce it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants one and two sought review of a decision of the District Court of Hennepin Ramsey County (Minnesota) that denied their motion to dismiss the charges against them for possession with intent to sell, and sale of cocaine, and possession of cocaine, respectively. Defendants one and three sought review of their conviction from the District Court of Ramsey County of possession with intent to distribute, and distribution of cocaine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In affirming the judgments, the court found that the legislation that classified cocaine as a narcotic in Schedule II offended neither equal protection, due process, nor privacy rights ensured by the United States and Minnesota constitutions. The statutory listing of cocaine in Schedule II carried, by implication, legislative findings that it had a high potential for abuse, and that its abuse could lead to severe psychological dependence. Because there was no evidence to the contrary, those findings were accepted. Further, although there was expert testimony that cocaine was regulated too severely, and that its potential for abuse and harmful consequences of abuse were less than those of alcohol, amphetamines, the opiates, and tobacco, that testimony did not undermine the legislation in a constitutional sense because it did not overwhelmingly refute the implied legislative judgments that cocaine had a high potential for abuse. Finally, by pharmacological standards, cocaine should not be grouped with opium and opiates. However, that did not affect the power of the legislature to group them together for purposes of prescribing the degree of regulation to be applied to cocaine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments that denied the motion to dismiss the cocaine charges against defendants one and two, and affirmed the conviction against defendants one and three.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator unemployment compensation claimant sought review by way of an application for a writ of certiorari of a decision of respondent, the Minnesota Department of Economic Security, which affirmed the denial of unemployment compensation to the claimant on the basis that he was conclusively presumed to be unavailable for work under Minn. Stat. &sect; 268.08, subd. 1(3) (as amended 1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after beginning law school, the claimant applied for unemployment compensation, which was denied on the basis of &sect; 268.08, subd. 1(3) when the claims deputy conclusively presumed the claimant unavailable for work. The Department affirmed the denial and the claimant sought review by way of a writ of certiorari. The court affirmed the decision. The court found that &sect; 268.08, subd. 1(3) created an irrebuttable presumption that a student was not available for work and was therefore not eligible for unemployment compensation unless he met other conditions. The classification effected by the 1977 amendment to &sect; 268.08, subd. 1(3) provided a predictable means for distinguishing between those who were genuinely attached to the labor force and those who were not. It therefore was not without reasonable basis and did not offend the due process clause of either the Minnesota or United States Constitution. Insofar as the presumption of nonavailability for work precluded a student-claimant from proving eligibility, it amounted to nothing more than a partial reclassification of students, removing them from coverage. This the legislature could do, given a rational basis for its action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the first-degree murders of his half-sister and her husband and sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment with execution stayed on the second sentence and lifetime probation ordered in the event of release on the first sentence. The court affirmed the postconviction court's judgment, finding that uncontradicted evidence that defendant procured his rifle, walked to the victims' bedroom, took careful aim, and pulled the trigger three times supported the finding of premeditation. New evidence of his intoxication did not negate his ability to premeditate the murders. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in failing to change venue because nothing suggested that the jurors were biased. The court found that defendant's consecutive life sentences did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment but that probation was invalid under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.135. However, the court vacated the sentence as modified by the postconviction court and remanded to the trial court for resentencing because it was unclear if the modified sentence effectuated the intentions of the trial court to protect society while not confining defendant for his entire life.</SPAN></P>

The prompt, warrantless investigation into the origin of the fire was reasonable and justified since the firefighters saw and smelled various chemicals while putting out the fire. The court concluded that the warrantless fire investigation was valid and was not a pretext for a criminal search.

Upon the creditor's request and in compliance with the requirements of the Minnesota attachment statute, Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mining company instituted an action against the Commissioner of the Department of Revenue to prevent collection of the occupation tax on mining and production of iron ore and other ores prior to May 1 of the calendar year following the year of mining or production. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the commissioner. On appeal, the mining company contended that the mining tax bill was unconstitutional and that it impaired a contract existing between the state and the mining company. The court held that article IX of the Omnibus Tax Bill was unconstitutional and did not reach the contract issues. The court determined that the phrase &quot;due and payable&quot; as used in the Minnesota Constitution precluded collection of the occupation tax prior to May 1 in the year following production. The court determined that the legislature had used the phrase &quot;due and payable&quot; in statutes and that the language suggested that money may not be collected until it was due and payable. The court concluded that the phrase &quot;due and payable&quot; is used where it's apparent that money may not be collected prior to its being due and payable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company appealed a decision of the District Court, Ramsey County (Minnesota), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant State in the company's claims for a refund of an additional excise tax imposed on it by the Minnesota Department of Revenue for two tax years. The company asserted that Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.47(2)&nbsp;unconstitutionally discriminated against its fermented malt beverages, which originated outside of the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company sought a refund of an additional excise tax imposed upon it. The amount it requested constituted the additional excise tax paid by the company in excess of the amount it would have paid had it been taxed equally with other brewers having production facilities in the state. Brewers selling identical products produced in the state were entitled during the two subject years to a maximum of $ 120,000 in credits per year against their excise tax liability. After the commission denied the claim, the company attacked the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 340.47(2), asserting that the statute unconstitutionally discriminated against its fermented malt beverages that originated outside of the state. The court rejected the company's argument, holding that the classifications established by &sect; 340.47(2), distinguishing between fermented malt beverages produced by brewers with brewing production facilities in the state and those produced by brewers out-of-state, did not contravene the equal protection guarantees contained in Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2, and art. 10, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the State in the company's action claiming a refund for the additional excise tax imposed on it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the District Court, Pine County (Minnesota), which found him guilty of one count of first-degree murder, two counts of second-degree murder, and one count of third-degree murder and acquitted him by reason of mental illness on one count of murder. At issue was whether the trial court erred in refusing to hold a post-verdict hearing to impeach the verdict for alleged jury misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a jealous rage, defendant shot and killed his wife, his five-year-old son, his 12-year-old stepson, his neighbor, and his neighbor's 12-year-old son after discovering that his wife was having an affair with the neighbor. He was acquitted of killing his stepson but convicted of murdering the others. On appeal, the court held that defendant's motion under Minn. R. Crim. P. Rule 26.03, subd. 19(6), seeking a hearing to impeach the verdict based on alleged evidence that jurors had lied about their beliefs concerning the defense of temporary mental illness, was properly denied because the jury had acquitted him of one murder count, based on that defense. The jury verdict was not inconsistent merely because it rejected the temporary mental illness defense for the first four killings but accepted it for the last killing. The argument essentially challenged the sufficiency of the evidence introduced to prove temporary mental illness. Therefore, even though Minnesota law required a consistent verdict, the verdict was not inconsistent. A tape recording of the neighbor's dying declaration, although emotionally gripping, was not unduly prejudicial; it related the course of events.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

A declaratory judgment action and a mandamus action were consolidated and respondent city was a party to the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the first part of the policeman's career his retirement was governed by the rules of the retirement fund. When he became employed by the city, the policeman lost his rights under the retirement fund and his retirement benefits were controlled by the relief association. The legislature enacted &sect; 62, which permitted the policeman to become a member of the retirement fund and which required the relief association to make payments to the retirement fund. The relief association refused to make the contributions mandated by the legislature, and the mandamus and declaratory judgment actions followed. The lower court ordered the relief association to contribute to the retirement fund and held that &sect; 62 was constitutional. The court affirmed, holding &sect; 62 was not special legislation in violation of Minn. Const. art. 12, &sect; 1 because 1977 Minn. Laws 429, &sect; 62 was specifically authorized by Minn. Const. art. 12, &sect; 2. The court ruled that 1977 Minn. Laws 429, &sect; 62 did not violate the equal protection guarantee because there were legitimate reasons for the individualized treatment of the policeman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decision to issue a writ of mandamus requiring that the relief association make contributions to the retirement fund, and the court affirmed the lower court's decision that the individualized treatment of the policeman passed muster under the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the residents had to exhaust available remedies by applying for a variance before a challenge to the constitutionality of the ordinance as it applied to their property was ripe for review. Furthermore, the ordinance represented a valid exercise of the police power and was fully authorized by the enabling statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 104.31- 104.40. The trial court's decision that the ordinance bore no demonstrable and reasonable relationship to legislative objectives was unfounded.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The invention company entered into contracts with its customers to evaluate and market their inventions.

The court rejected the company's contention that the providing of a &quot;success ratio&quot; to the customers was an impossible burden. The court noted that the two facts necessary to compute the success ratio, the total number of customers and the amount of money received by the customer in excess of his fees paid to the company, were available to the company. The court noted that mere threats of being forced out of business by state regulation did not provide grounds for the judiciary to substitute its economic and social judgment for that of the legislature, and it concluded that the company presented no real evidence that the bond required in Minn. Stat. &sect; 325A.06 was confiscatory.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate was elected to the office of representative.

Stat. &sect; 210A.04 of the Minnesota election law. Under Minn. Stat. &sect; 209.02, any violation of an election law provision was grounds for nullifying an election if it was deliberate, serious, and material. The trial court dismissed the election contest. The court held that it had no jurisdiction to issue a final and binding decision because the legislature had final authority in the matter under Minn. Const. art. IV, &sect; 6, which stated that each house was to be the judge of the election returns and eligibility of its own members. The court issued an advisory opinion, concluding that the candidate violated &sect; 210A.04 and that the violation was deliberate, serious, and material.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had earlier ordered that counsel be appointed for an indigent, teenaged male who had been named in a paternity suit; a petition for rehearing before the court was filed in that cause. A trial court relied upon that opinion to order the appointment of counsel for an active duty member of the armed forces who had been named in a separate paternity suit; the county and pregnant woman appealed this order. The court in parts granted relief and denied it. The court determined that the mother's and putative father's interests, and the developing and significant interest of an illegitimate child in an accurate determination of paternity, dictated a change in the traditional approach to representation afforded putative fathers in paternity actions. The court therefore exercised its supervisory authority to ensure the fair administration of the adversarial justice system and declared that counsel should be provided an indigent defendant who met the eligibility standards required for proceedings in forma pauperis pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 563.01. Indigency was to be ascertained using the &quot;substantial hardship&quot; standard of Minn. R. Crim. P. 5.02 and its implementing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party filed an action for negligent medical treatment. Defendants filed motions for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. The injured party appealed. In reversing and remanding the trial court's order, the court concluded that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the basis of the statute of limitations. The court found that there was a genuine issue regarding the injured party's sanity and the tolling of the statute of limitations. The court determined that the issue of whether the notice requirement may also have been tolled by insanity was an issue that the court could potentially decide at a later date. The court remanded the case without prejudice to the injured party's right to have the court review the notice claim requirement if the injured party was found insane. The court stated that the trial court record needed further development on the issue of notice of claim. The court declined to dismiss the appeal against one of the physicians even though it was technically improper. The court noted that the injured party appealed from the order that granted summary judgment rather than the actual entry of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The warranty deed contained a restrictive covenant that no intoxicating liquors or foods were to be permitted on the premises. The stadium was never built, and the tract was sold to the developer, who desired to construct restaurants and bars on the land. It commenced an action seeking to delete certain restrictions. The trial court granted summary judgment to the developer, finding that the restrictions were not enforceable because they had become nominal and of no actual or substantial benefit to any party. The seller appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the covenant at issue was essentially a covenant not to compete, and such covenants were disfavored in the law as potentially restraining trade. The covenant was also subject to strict construction in favor of the developer because it had no time restriction and prohibited a broad range of commercial activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent owned a tract of undeveloped property within the city limits. City subdivision regulations, however, prohibited residential development of land not served by a sewer and water system. Respondent appealed the property assessment after the installation of water and sanitary sewer lines. The primary issue on appeal was whether the trial court exceeded the permissible scope of review of special assessments. The court held that if the city council had instituted an adversary proceeding before an impartial referee and made findings on the specific issue of special benefits, there would have been reason for judicial review to be more limited. However, that was not the case. The City initially made no findings of special benefits without procedural protection. The role of the trial court was thus characterized not so much as conducting an independent review as making an initial determination. However, the trial court went one step too far in ordering a reduction of the assessment rather than communicating its finding to the city council. The court reversed the trial court's order on that technical issue alone, remanded for a new order, and affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident alleged in his complaint that on or about March 3, 1972, a car he was driving was struck from behind by a car owned by the city and operated by the employee. No notice of claim was given by the resident to the city, and suit was not commenced against the city until about four years after the accident. Section 466.05 provided that no action for damages could be maintained against a municipality unless (1) notice of the claim was given within 30 days of the alleged loss, and (2) suit was commenced within one year after such notice. The resident argued that the notice of claim and commencement of suit provisions of &sect; 466.05 were constitutionally infirm. The court reversed, holding that: (1) there was substantial compliance with the notice requirement of &sect; 466.05 where the resident submitted a &quot;vehicle collision report&quot; to the city about two weeks after the accident, noting that the resident was apparently injured; (2) the requirement that suit be commenced within one year of giving notice was not rationally related to any legitimate government function; and (3) the one year commencement of suit requirement was invalid as a denial of equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured June 30, 1977. The workers' compensation judge and the workers' compensation court of appeals determined that Minn.

The employer and insurer argued that the 1977 version and Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.645 (1975) required that an employee injured after October 1 of any year had to wait until the October following the date of disability to receive an adjustment. The court held that both version of the statute were substantially the same, and provided that each annual adjustment applied to all employees injured in the year following the adjustment. Minn. Stat. &sect; 645.17 (1977) required that a statute be interpreted under the presumption that the Legislature did not intend an unreasonable result. In affirming the judgment the court held that the employee need not be receiving benefits on October 1, 1976 in order to receive the adjustment for that year. Because the 1975 and 1977 versions were identical there was no retroactive application issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contestee won the election by 16,000 votes. The contestant complained that the contestee violated Minn.

The contestant claimed that he only meant to signify that he belonged to that party. In affirming the judgment the court first rejected the trial court's finding that the contestee had not violated &sect; 210A.02. Before reaching that issue the court held that the contestant's failure to allege initially that the violation was made &quot;knowingly&quot; was not jurisdictional, and also held against the contestee's contention that &sect; 210A.02 was void for vagueness and an infringement of free speech. The court easily concluded that the violation was deliberate, serious, and material, as required by Minn. Stat. &sect; 209.02, subd. 1. Though the contestant thus was caught red-handed, the court invoked the safety valve of Minn. Stat. &sect; 210A.38 by finding that the contestant had not meant to violate the law, and also that the use of the initials probably had no effect on the election's outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners contested the constitutionality of legislation that required them as owners of severed mineral interests to register their interests or forfeit them to the state. The owners and the government officials both appealed from the district court's ruling that the legislation was constitutional except for the forfeiture procedures. The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that severed and unsevered mineral interests were taxed in a uniform manner as required by Minn. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1 and that there was sufficient evidence to support the reasonableness of the amount of the tax. Because the severed mineral interests were generally older and fractionalized, the court agreed that the registration by publication requirement was not unreasonable and did not violate due process. The court concluded, however, that the forfeiture procedures violated due process because the procedures did not provide the owners with notice or a hearing before the forfeiture of their mineral interests even if the owners could be easily located.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), which sought an injunction to prevent respondent property owner's draining a lake for agricultural purposes, challenged an order of the District Court, Big Stone County (Minnesota), which dismissed the DNR's complaint and denied its request for an injunction, ruling that granting an injunction would constitute an unconstitutional taking of the owner's property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found the lake to have been a body of public water. No notice of review was filed challenging this determination, and it was the law of the case. Therefore, barring constitutional impediments, the requirements of Minn. Stat. &sect; 105.38 were applicable, and the owner was required to obtain a permit to drain the lake. Because the permit requirement set out in Minn. Stat. &sect; 105.42 was not on its face unconstitutional, the drainage of the lake without a permit was impermissible and the maintenance of the artificial drain should have been enjoined. Once the trial court determined that the lake constituted public waters, it should not have passed upon constitutional issues on this matter unrelated to the public waters issue for the reason that the owner had not applied for a permit and had not been denied one. For the same reason, the court did not reach the constitutional issue determined by the trial court. There being no determination by the DNR on the issuance of a permit, there was nothing to evaluate. It followed there was no justiciable issue before the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that the medical association failed to establish that they had any statutory or constitutional right to prevent disclosure of the requested information and that the information sought by the Welfare Department was public data accessible under the Official Records Act. The medical association argued that the information sought was not a &quot;public record&quot; accessible to the public under Minn. Stat. &sect; 15.17. The information was stored on computer tapes and the association argued that only microfilm copies of invoices from which the computer tapes were made constituted public records. The court rejected this argument, holding that whether the records were &quot;public records&quot; depended not on the form in which they were kept but on whether they were necessary to a full and accurate knowledge of official activities. The court also rejected the medical association's argument that disclosure of the information would restrict a woman's right to abortion. The court reasoned that the association's concerns were nothing more than speculation and that nothing showed that the procedures used by the Welfare Department were insufficient to protect patient anonymity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's wife obtained a divorce and was granted custody of the parties' two children, with defendant receiving specific visitation rights. Defendant's wife then filed a petition alleging that defendant had molested the children, and the trial court issued an order restraining defendant from visiting the children. Subsequently, defendant allegedly picked the children up as they walked to school and took them to California. The State filed a complaint against defendant, charging him with detaining the children outside the state in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.26. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the action, arguing that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the matter because the alleged incident had not occurred outside the State. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, and the State sought review. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 609.26 had to be strictly construed, and, under the plain language, defendant could not be prosecuted unless the act of taking the children had occurred in another state. The court found that since the children were taken while in the State and later transported to California, defendant could not be charged with a violation of &sect; 609.26.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the sale and possession of a controlled substance, marijuana. Defendant claimed that the evidence was not sufficient to establish the identify of the substance seized and that the state's controlled substance classification scheme violated constitutional equal protection guarantees. The court held that: (1) the definition of &quot;marijuana&quot; contained in Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.01 reflected an intent to regulate all species of the genus cannabis; (2) in light of the finding of the trial court that the scientific testing procedures used to identify the contraband were inadequate, the additional considerations relied upon by the trial court including the price charged and representations made by defendant were not sufficient to support a determination of guilt; (3) however, because the trial court misapprehended the standard of proof applicable, the court could not determine whether the State's scientific evidence would have satisfied the trial court had it applied the correct standard; and (4) in view of the continued debate over the effects of marijuana, its scheduling was not arbitrary and unreasonable so as to render it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The insurer, as garnishee, was served a garnishment summons pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 571.41, subd. 2. The United States Supreme Court vacated an order denying appellants' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and insufficient process and remanded the case for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand, the court distinguished a recent United States Supreme Court case and held that the assertion of jurisdiction over appellants pursuant to &sect; 571.41, subd. 2 was consistent with the due process. Accordingly, the court affirmed the district court's order that denied appellants' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The court found that the insurer was doing business in the state and was contractually obligated to defend and indemnify the nonresident driver. Thus, the court held that &sect; 571.41, subd. 2 satisfied due process standards because it provided jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant via garnishment of its contractual obligation within the state. In addition, under the statute the nonresident defendant was guaranteed notice, his liability was limited to the policy's face amount, and only residents of the forum state could utilize the procedure. The court further found that this garnishment procedure specifically premised jurisdiction on attachment of the obligations to respond to the claim in the underlying action and that the state had a legitimate interest in facilitating recoveries for resident plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State introduced scientific and non-scientific evidence to identify the material seized as marijuana. The trial court concluded that the scientific tests alone were insufficient to identify the substance beyond a reasonable doubt and also considered the following facts: the amount of the sale (220 pounds); the sale price ($ 120 per pound); defendant's statement to a witness that the product was &quot;Mexican grade&quot; marijuana; the inferred fact that a seller of a product containing 220 pounds was probably sophisticated and competent enough to have made his own tests before he himself bought the product. On appeal, the court ruled that Minnesota law required proof of the actual identity of the substance, defendant's belief was not sufficient. The price charged and representations made by defendant were, at best, only assertions of his belief. In addition the last &quot;fact&quot; listed the practice of testing among large volume sellers, was wholly speculative and not supported by the evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a Minnesota resident, served defendant, an Indiana resident, with a copy of the summons and complaint in his action seeking damages for personal injuries sustained in a car accident in Indiana. Plaintiff also served a garnishment summons on the insurer pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 571.41, subd. 2. The court declined to reverse its prior decision and held that Minnesota's assertion of jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants pursuant to &sect; 571.41, subd. 2, as limited by the prior decision, satisfied the due process standards set forth in International Shoe and Shaffer.The court viewed as relevant the relationship between the defending parties, the litigation, and the forum state and found that Minnesota did not lack such minimally requisite &quot;contacts, ties or relations&quot; to those defending parties as to offend the requirements of due process. In Shaffer, the sequestered stock constituted only an attachable asset used to compel the defendants' personal appearance. In plaintiff's case, the insurer's obligation to defend and indemnify, while theoretically separable from the tort action, had no independent value or significance apart from accident litigation.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that it was error to not disclose the identity of a confidential informant, that entry upon their premises for arrest was unconstitutional, and that a search warrant and its scope were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A confidential informant advised the police that marijuana was being delivered to one defendant. The officers put his home under surveillance and arrested defendant when he went to leave in his truck. As one officer walked to the vehicle, he passed a large window and saw a large quantity of marijuana plants on the kitchen table. The officers arrested persons in the house and searched the truck. A search of the house was made after a search warrant was received. The trial court was entitled to credit the officers' testimony over defendants' conclusory affidavits that the prosecution fabricated the informant. The warrantless entry and arrest on the driveway were constitutionally permissible because the officers had probable cause to believe that those arrested had committed a felony. There was no search of the home until after the arrival of a search warrant. Minn. Stat. &sect; 629.34(3) authorized officers with probable cause to enter a home to make a felony arrest after announcing their office and purpose. The seizure of marijuana packages in the truck was proper when the officers had probable cause to believe there were large drug quantities in the truck. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Director of the Lawyers Professional Responsibility Board (professional board) (Minnesota) sought disbarment of respondent judge, and the Board on Judicial Standards (judicial board) afforded the judge due process regarding his fitness to retain judicial office but recommended removal from office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The professional board requested that the judge be disbarred, but the court stayed the disbarment proceedings until the judicial board made its findings and recommendations. The judicial board afforded the judge due process regarding his fitness to retain judicial office, and it recommended that the judge be removed. The court found that the allegations of grave professional misconduct were substantiated by clear and convincing evidence and warranted imposition of the extreme sanctions recommended. Thus, the court ordered that the judge be disbarred and removed from judicial office. Minn. Stat. &sect; 490.16 was a constitutional delegation of the power of removal of judicial officers to the judicial branch of government. The judge was entitled to a fair and impartial hearing and to a reasonable opportunity to meet the charges brought against him, and this was not violated by the failure to allege violations of precise disciplinary rules. The statutory standard was not fatally vague or overbroad. Because the court conducted an independent review of the evidence, the absence of a quorum would not have been fatal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, the Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, and the Metropolitan Council, appealed the decision of the District Court, Ramsey County (Minnesota), which held the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Act, L. 1977, c. 89, to be unconstitutional. The Act, inter alia, defined a taxing district for a two percent tax on alcoholic beverages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act was established for the operation of sports facilities, and the selection of site and construction of new or remodeled sports facilities. Inter alia, the Act authorized the issuance of bonds to finance the construction of the sports facilities. The bonds were to be paid off by revenue generated from a two percent tax to be imposed within a specific taxing district in the metropolitan area. Plaintiff, owner of a bar, filed suit seeking to enjoin implementation of the Act. The trial court found that although the taxing district was proper, and expenditures under the Act were for a public purpose, the Act was unconstitutional because it failed to pass the legislature by a three-fifths vote, it failed to express its subject fully in its title, and that three municipalities were improperly excluded from its taxing provisions. The court reversed the trial court's decision, in part because the court concluded that the bonds authorized by the Act were not general revenue bonds that created public debt necessitating a three-fifths vote in the legislature. The court also concluded that the three municipalities were properly excluded from the Act's taxing provisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the trial court (Minnesota), which was entered on a jury's verdict that convicted defendant of burglary and aggravated rape, a violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.291(2). Defendant was sentenced to serve concurrent prison terms on these criminal charges, to be served consecutively with prior sentences on burglary and receiving stolen property for which his probation was revoked.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A victim was raped at knifepoint in her home. Afterwards, she ran to another apartment and called police, giving them a description of her attacker. The police saw defendant, who matched the victim's description, exit a taxi and enter an apartment. The taxi driver told the police that when he went into the building to collect his fare, defendant had a conversation with someone else in the apartment. Thereafter, the police went to the apartment, arrested defendant, and searched his apartment for the other person. No one else was found, but the officers found, in plain sight, pantyhose, gloves, and leather jackets that matched the victim's description. The trial court's judgment, which convicted defendant of burglary and rape, was affirmed by the court. The court held that the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant given his similarity to the victim's description, and the fact that the taxi picked him up within two blocks of the crimes. The court held that the officers were justified in making a protective search of the premises to determine if another person was present. Thus, any items observed in plain sight where an individual could have been hiding were admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the trustee for heirs whose decedent was killed in a collision, appealed a decision in a wrongful death action against defendants, the owner and the driver of the truck. At trial, plaintiff objected, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.123, to the admission of the results of a blood-alcohol test. The trial court (Minnesota) admitted the evidence, the jury found in favor of defendants, and plaintiff's motion for a new trial was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent left a 3.2-beer establishment and within minutes his pickup truck was involved in an accident with a semi-trailer. At the hospital, a Minnesota state trooper who had investigated the accident requested that a blood sample be drawn, and the results showed a reading of .19 blood alcohol content by weight. Plaintiff argued that the blood sample was drawn without consent from an unconscious person under color of the authority of &sect; 169.123. Plaintiff reasoned, therefore, that the evidence should be excluded in the civil action, as it would be in a criminal prosecution for driving while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage. The court disagreed and reasoned that, by initiating the lawsuit, plaintiff put in issue the negligence of the two drivers involved in the accident. Any prior drinking by either driver was relevant to that issue. The court held that the test results of the blood sample were therefore properly admitted. The implied-consent law, &sect;&sect; 169.121 and 169.123, could not be used to exclude material evidence and possibly hinder a just result in a civil action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband won a bet placed at a dog race while appellants were on vacation in another state. When the husband filed his state tax return, he deducted the gambling win and did not pay any taxes. The commissioner disallowed the husband's deduction on his state tax return, and the tax court affirmed the commissioner's decision. Appellants filed a writ of certiorari, and the court affirmed the tax court's decision. The court held that the money the husband won was income derived from intangible personal property not employed in his business and was assignable to the state under the terms of Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.17(2) (1976) or &sect; 290.17(5). The court ruled that the state could constitutionally tax appellants on income derived from the ownership of intangible personal property outside of the state because there was a sufficient nexus between the state and the income producing activity. To the extent that the tax affected interstate commerce it would seem to have been a permissible tax on income from interstate commerce and not an invalid direct tax on such commerce. The tax was not offensive to common concepts of fairness. The tax did not impinge on appellants' right to travel.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, finding that (1) the trial court's construction of the Minnesota statutes that authorized a police officer to use a weapon to arrest a fleeing felony suspect was not constitutionally infirm under the Due Process Clause; (2) the Model Penal Code provision was a proposed statute that was intended to define justifiable-homicide, and the court had no power to adopt a justifiable-homicide statute; (3) Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner sought a writ of certiorari to review the Tax Court's decision before a motion for amended findings was heard. The court noted that a direct conflict existed between Rules 115 and 125 of the Rules of Civil Appellate Procedure and Minn. Stat. &sect; 271.10(2), regarding the procedures for obtaining a writ of certiorari. The statute's requirement that the original writ with proof of service be filed in the Tax Court was in conflict with the rules' requirement that the original be filed in the state supreme court. The court held that in light of the road-building contractors' admission that they had been served, and in light of the fact that the Tax Court made the required return, any error was harmless. The court held that the Minn. Stat. &sect; 297A.25(1)(h) clearly exempts the road contractors from paying a use tax on any materials they may have used in road building, despite the language of Minn. Stat. &sect; 297A.25(4). The court held that if the legislature had intended &sect; 297A.25(4) to apply to the use tax. It could have added the &quot;storage, use, or consumption&quot; language as it did innumerable times in the Tax Reform and Relief Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the Tax Court that exempted the road contractors form use taxes on certain road-building materials.

Stat. &sect; 609.72, subd. 1(3), for saying &quot;fuck you pigs&quot; to two police officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a friend were stopped and questioned by police about their knowledge of a crime committed by boys they knew. After the questioning was finished, defendant and her friend were released to go home. After walking partway, defendant turned and said, &quot;fuck you pigs&quot; to the officers. The officers arrested defendant. The district court convicted defendant and adjudicated her delinquent. Defendant appealed. The court reversed. Because the words were not erotic, they were legally not obscene. Defendant had standing whether or not her words were proscribed under a narrowly drawn interpretation of &sect; 609.72, subd. 1(3). Section 609.72, subd. 1(3) was unconstitutional on its face because it clearly contemplated punishment for speech that was protected under U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. However, the court construed &sect; 609.72, subd. 1(3) narrowly to refer only to &quot;fighting words,&quot; which made it constitutional. Because defendant's words under the circumstances were not likely to provoke a violent reaction, the words were not &quot;fighting words&quot; and the conviction required reversal. The officers had overreacted and defendant should have been subjected to parental discipline.</SPAN></P>

The distiller appealed from the judgment prescribing the price filing procedure.

The subject land consisted of two tracts which, taken together, comprised 40 acres. One tract, Parcel A, contained the practice range and five of the eighteen holes of the country club. The other tract, Parcel B, bordered on the first tract but was not part of the golf course. Project 580 was a 12-inch water main running along 1287 feet of the north side of Parcel A. The club was assessed $ 13,835.25 for this frontage, and a $ 17,066.50 area assessment for 31.03 acres of Parcels A and B. The club was assessed $ 685.20 for the sewer main extension because it had a corner lot. The trial court affirmed the assessments. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the trial court failed to take into account the function of and interrelationships of the assessed land. The court concluded that the country club's land, most of which was used as a golf course, received no special benefit from the improvement being constructed, therefore the assessment was an unconstitutional taking without compensation.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the prosecutor did not improperly prompt the witness or that there was any substantial likelihood that defendant was inaccurately identified as one of the robbers. The trial court agreed to grant a weekend continuance to locate a witness provided that defendant call all other witnesses who were available, including defendant. The court found defendant's constitutional argument without merit because in his opening statement, defense counsel made it clear that defendant would testify. Further, the court held that defendant was in no way adversely affected by the conditions imposed by the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute at issue governed the placement of candidates' names on election ballots in Minnesota. Under the statutory scheme, the names of party-designated candidates were to precede those of independent candidates on partisan election ballots. Therefore, the candidate, who was an independent, would never have his name appear first on a ballot. He challenged the constitutionality of the statute on equal protection grounds. The trial court found the statute to be constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the statute satisfied the rational basis test and that any deviation from the present method of assigning ballot position was properly a matter for legislative determination. Because the statute was more in the nature of a simple electoral regulation, rational basis scrutiny was more appropriate than strict scrutiny analysis, which applied to a sufficiently direct infringement on fundamental franchise rights. The statute did create some degree of positional bias but the statute applied only to partisan elections, and the evidence clearly established that that party designation was of far greater importance than ballot position.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that the statute was unconstitutional because the word &quot;induces,&quot; as used therein, was vague. The word was unambiguous and commonly understood, the court said. Moreover, evidence that defendant solicited customers for the victim was properly admitted without notice under Minn. R. Crim. P. 7.02, because the defendant's acts were part of a continuing criminal episode lasting five days. Moreover, defendant was not prejudiced by the State's elicitation of testimony suggesting that defendant was a prostitute, as there was other properly elicited evidence from which the jury could infer that she was a prostitute. Further, defendant was not prejudiced by the State's reference in closing that its evidence was uncontradicted, as it did not suggest to the jury that defendant had an obligation to call witnesses.

The court held that the Compensation Court properly found that the employee suffered a permanent partial disability as a result of the injury, and that under &sect; 176.101, subd. 3(40) the compensation judge was to look to the percentage of such permanent partial disability, which the employee suffered. It was determined that the employee suffered 50 percent permanent partial disability from the loss of his kidney, which was within the bounds of discretion which the legislature had delegated.

The clearinghouse retained the right to hire new employees, vetted complaints, provided the contractors with the crews' sales pitches, and supplied order forms.

The court affirmed defendant 's conviction holding that members of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe retain unextinguished treaty rights to fish on Leech Lake and that &sect; 97.431 was a rational compromise between these rights and the legitimate interest of the State of Minnesota to regulate fishing within its borders.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The power associations filed an application for a corridor designation and a certificate of corridor compatibility pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 116C.57 and 116C.61 in regards to the HVTL. MEQC issued a certificate of corridor compatibility. On appeal, the district found that MEQC's designation of a corridor for the HVTL, the later designation of a route within that corridor, and the issuance of a construction permit, as well as MEA's grant of a certificate of need for the HVTL, were proper and substantially supported by the record. On further appeal, the court held that MEQC's failure to require an environmental impact statement (EIS) at the corridor selection stage was not reversible error because, among other things, MEQC was given discretion under Minn. Stat. &sect; 116D.03, subd. 1 to determine when an EIS was required and there had never been a statutory requirement mandating an EIS at the corridor selection stage. The farm-citizen organizations failed to establish that the EIS was untrue or misleading. The court also found that denial of the permit based on the pollution of the ozone would have been unreasonable because the level of pollution was so minimal.</SPAN></P>

The district court found that the salary increases for each of the county officers was unreasonable and not based on an adequate consideration of their respective responsibilities. The district court found that the budgets for the offices of county recorder, auditor, and treasurer were too low. The district court set increased salaries for the officers and budgets for their offices. All officers, except the sheriff, were awarded attorney fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved the validity under the Minnesota Medicaid statute of the use of medical assistance funds for elective, non-therapeutic abortions. On appeal, the court held that a taxpayer suing as a taxpayer had standing to challenge administrative action, which allegedly was rulemaking adopted without compliance with the statutory notice requirements. There could be no doubt that the policy bulletin fell within the general definition of a &quot;rule.&quot; The court determined that a policy bulletin issued by the Commissioner which allowed the coverage of elective, non-therapeutic abortions constituted rulemaking without compliance with the public notice and hearing requirements of the Minnesota Administrative Procedure Act. Thus, if the legislature delegated authority to an administrative agency and if the administrative agency elected to adopt rules pursuant to that authority, the procedure outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act had to be followed in promulgating those rules. Accordingly, the court remanded for compliance with rulemaking procedures. Further, the language of the Minnesota Medicaid statute did not make clear the status of elective, non-therapeutic abortions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the installation of the furnace constituted, as a matter of law, the construction of an improvement to real property and thus, the limitations period found in Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The controversy centered around the construction of a freeway. 1975 Minn. Laws ch. 203 prohibited any further construction of that freeway and authorized the construction of a parkway along this route. The nonprofit corporation supported completion of a certain portion of the freeway grid and the chamber of commerce promoted the business climate in the city. They alleged that ch. 203 was unconstitutional. The trial court's decision was affirmed insofar as it found no justiciable controversy. Its judgment on the merits was vacated. The court held that it was a legislative matter to determine when, and for what reasons, freeway construction must come to a halt. The fact that such a halt must disappoint some and please others did not give rise to a justiciable controversy. Further, a justiciable controversy must exist before the courts had jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment regarding the constitutionality of a statute. Proceedings for a declaratory judgment had to be based on an actual controversy. Although taxpayers could sue to enjoin waste or illegal use of public funds, this case was different, in that it involved the non-expenditure of public funds on a highway.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Defendant cited no cases holding that the corroboration rule in sex-crime cases was mandated by the United States Constitution and offered no persuasive argument in support of such a holding. The best argument for the rule, the protection of innocent defendants against false charges, was served by ordinary safeguards in the criminal law -- the jury and the judge's power to grant relief to a defendant if there was insufficient evidence. Further, there was sufficient evidence of defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, as the victim's testimony was positive and not contradicted and was strongly corroborated by other evidence.</SPAN></P>

The Tax Court of Appeals affirmed the order. On appeal, the judgment was affirmed. The court held that under &sect; 290.01, subd. 20(a)(8), no deduction for moving expenses can be allowed when the taxpayer relocates to a sister state, because Minnesota had no power to tax income that is not earned within its borders. The court ruled there was no nexus between Minnesota and the taxpayer's income-producing activities in Georgia.

The Hennepin County Municipal Court (Minnesota) granted the designer's motion for summary judgment and the manufacturer appealed, alleging that there was no valid in personam jurisdiction under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-535 to 25-541 (Supp. 1974).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The designer ordered four tables from the manufacturer for resale to a client. The designer alleged that the tables were defectively manufactured, resulting in a breach of implied warranty. The manufacturer was served with process in New York with in personam jurisdiction being asserted under Nebraska's long-arm statute,&nbsp;Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-535 to 25-541 (Supp. 1974). The manufacturer did not answer and a default judgment was ordered. The designer filed an action to garnish the manufacturer's property located in Minnesota. The manufacturer claimed that the Nebraska judgment was null and void and thus unenforceable in Minnesota. On appeal from the trial court's grant of summary judgment, the court held that the provisions of the Nebraska long-arm statute were satisfied, and that proper jurisdiction was asserted over the manufacturer within the scope of the statute. The court determined that (1) the manufacturer voluntarily placed its products in the Nebraska market, derived a benefit therefrom, and invoked the benefit and protection of Nebraska laws, and (2) the manufacturer had previously shipped furniture into Nebraska for five years in an amount approximating $ 2,500 per year.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 152.02(5) (1974).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1973, phentermine was designated a controlled drug under Federal law. In 1974, the board of pharmacy filed a regulation designating phentermine as a controlled substance under Minnesota law. It was not until after defendant had been charged with the offense of possession of phentermine that the legislature amended Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.02(5) to expressly include phentermine as a controlled drug. The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground that the possession of phentermine did not constitute a crime. The State appealed. The court held that the trial court erroneously interpreted the pertinent provisions of Minnesota's statutes for the control of prohibited drugs. The court held that the legislature's delegation of rulemaking authority to the board to revise the statutory schedules enumerating controlled substances was not an unconstitutional relinquishment of its exclusive lawmaking power to the board. Since the board was only employed to ascertain those facts or circumstances that would make Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.02 operational, i.e. which drugs produced deleterious effects that lead to dependence, there was no impermissible delegation of pure legislative power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The University was granted power over its internal management pursuant to Minn. Const. of 1974, art. 13, &sect; 3 to the exclusion of the legislature. The legislature adopted 1976 Minn. Laws 348 (Law) appropriating funds to the University to complete a learning resources center conditioned upon the University's compliance with the Act. The University sought a permanent injunction prohibiting the State from withholding proceeds of appropriations for building construction projects and a declaration that the Act was invalid on its face under Minn. Const. art. 13, &sect; 3. On appeal, the court concluded that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the University. The court determined that the legislature's conditioning the appropriation of funds upon compliance with the Act did not constitute an attempt by the legislature to control the exercise of the constitutional powers of the University over its internal management. The court found that the Act was intended to promote the general welfare and prevent conflicts of interests and fraudulent acts and was not aimed specifically at the University.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, holding that where police assumed custody of defendant's automobile for no legitimate state purpose other than safekeeping, and where defendant had arranged for alternative means, not shown to be unreasonable, for the safeguarding of his property, impoundment of his automobile was unreasonable and, therefore, the concomitant inventory was an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. The State had not shown that the impoundment was a reasonable means of furthering a reasonable state purpose. Accordingly, the search incident to the impoundment violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights, and the evidence obtained thereby was inadmissible. The court concluded that there was a sufficient possibility of adverse collateral legal consequences to hold that the appeal was not moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The incident occurred during an argument in a parking lot with defendant and others in front of three State's witnesses. On appeal, the controlling issue was whether the admission of the pistol during trial was a violation of the omnibus hearing order constituting prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct. The court held that the trial court's admonishment regarding the &quot;illustrative&quot; purpose of the exhibit was not sufficient to alter the jury's perception of the pistol as the one allegedly fired by defendant. It was difficult to imagine that the jury's finding of conviction was not influenced by the display of a pistol identified by two witnesses to be of the exact same type as that seen in defendant's hands on the night of the incident. The introduction of the pistol, together with testimony from the witness that this was defendant's pistol, surely affected the jury. The prejudicial effect was more than sufficient to satisfy the standard as contributing to the conviction. The court reversed the judgment and the case was remanded for a new trial on the basis of the violation of the order suppressing the pistol.</SPAN></P>

The police arrested defendant and advised him of his Miranda rights. Defendant gave the police a tape-recorded statement and he made two drawings of the murder weapons and a map. The defense did not receive a copy of the tape-recorded statement, but the court admitted the statement into evidence. The accomplice testified at trial. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the trial court erred when it admitted the tape-recorded statement because Minn. Stat. &sect; 611.033 required the prosecution to give a copy of the statement to defendant; (2) the error was harmless because the State properly introduced a second confession that defendant made; (3) the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in not granting a continuance or when he admitted evidence of other crimes because the other crimes proved motive.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court after a careful consideration of the effects of the mandatory presumption on the allocation of negligence to the respective parties in a wrongful-death action pursuant to the comparative negligence law in Minn. Stat. &sect; 604.01, as well as the subsequent effect of estoppel by verdict on the survivor, held that Minn.

The jury in that action found the decedent to be 65 percent negligent, and damages were apportioned accordingly. The trustee then brought a separate wrongful death action against the company and the driver. The trial court granted summary judgment to the transport company and the driver based on collateral estoppel. On appeal, the court reversed the grant of summary judgment. The court noted that at the time of the proceedings, Minn. Stat. &sect; 602.04 required that the jury be instructed that the decedent was presumed to have acted with due care. Based upon this presumption, the trustee did not forcefully argue the issue of the decedent's negligence.

The district court denied the applicant's motion to reverse the decision, and also denied the Board's request that the district court modify the decision.

Without deciding the constitutional issues, it held that there was no statutory authority, either express or implied, for the Board to adopt a rule such as BE 61 requiring a public necessity for the granting of the license; it further held that there was evidence in the record that the applicant intended to operate a school which would have offered specialized training in hair styling, which graduates of existing barber schools generally did not receive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mining company's practice of disposing of tailings by dumping them into Lake Superior was enjoined by a federal court. In an effort to find a new disposal site, the mining company sought a permit from the DNR and PCA for an on-land disposal site at an area four miles from its mine. The DNR and PCA hearing officer refused to grant the permit and held that the proposed site was too dangerous, and the operation would have too detrimental an impact on wildlife and natural resources. He proposed a site 16 miles from the mine, inside federal forest land. The district court reversed the judgment of the hearing officer and concluded that the mining company should have been granted the permit. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the district court. The court held that the standard of review in permit cases would now be governed by Minn. Stat. &sect; 15.0425. The court stated that the mining company would be held strictly to the conditions imposed by the court, the federal court, state and federal pollution laws, and the Air Pollution Control Regulations. The court held that there was no substantial evidence to support a finding that the alternate disposal site was less hazardous.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner claimed that only the individual who both lived in the apartment and had obtained the certification of &quot;rent paid&quot; form from the landlord was entitled to the credit.</SPAN></P>

After a hearing ordered by the Tax Court, the Commissioner found that the cotenants had agreed that the taxpayer's cotenant should receive the credit, but the taxpayer repudiated that agreement in order to challenge the constitutionality of the classification. The taxpayer claimed that a credit based on a rental unit, without regard to the number of occupants, was unreasonable and unconstitutional. The Tax Court agreed with the challenge and allowed a credit to each of the cotenants. The court reversed. The propriety of a classification for purposes of legislation was primarily for the legislature, and its classification was presumptively valid. Moreover, the rental unit classification was not unreasonable as it paralleled the homestead credit insofar as it was independent of the number of occupants. Since the statute said that the Commissioner's decision was to be final if cotenants could not agree on which of them was to receive a credit, the Commissioner's decision to allocate the credit on the basis of an agreement between the cotenants was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

Laws 203 was described in its title as &quot;An act relating to transportation.&quot; On appeal, the court affirmed. The court considered the functions and purposes of Minn. Const. art. 4, &sect; 17. The court found that although certain provisions within the challenged legislation individually failed of enactment, it did not mean that combined in a single bill they comprised different and disconnected subjects. The court reasoned that none of the provisions of 1975 Minn. Laws 203 could have been characterized as &quot;riders,&quot; having no relation to the general subject of the bill. The court also found that the title of 1975 Minn. Laws 203 was not misleading. The court reasoned that although &quot;transportation&quot; was a general term, no unrelated provisions were hidden surreptitiously within it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents challenged the Board's plan to improve a drainage ditch. By the time the case was fully litigated, the cost of construction had risen and exceeded the original assessment of benefit, but 1975 Minn. Laws 249 had also been enacted, which increased the permissible spending limit for the ditch project. The residents challenged the constitutionality of Law 249 under Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 7, 11, and 13 and claimed that their right to due process, their right to be compensated for the public taking of property, and their right not to have contractual rights impaired were violated. In affirming, the court held that the residents did not have a due process right to notice and hearing because the law had general application and did not effect them specially or individually. The legislative action did require notice and hearing to all affected landowners even though it resulted in a public taking of property. Just as the costs of the project had risen over time, presumably the value of the benefits had also similarly risen; the residents did not show that the cost exceeded the benefits, which was required for them to prove a taking without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

The owner defended on the grounds that Minn. Stat. &sect; 473.413, subd. 6 was unconstitutional. The trial court agreed that, insofar as the statute authorized the Transit Area to regulate other public transit systems in the area, it denied the owner the right to a hearing before an impartial tribunal in contravention of the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Minn. Const. art. I. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the statute insofar as it authorized the Transit Area to regulate itself, which the owner appealed, contending that the entire subdivision should have been declared unconstitutional. The owner was not aggrieved by that part of the judgment from which he appealed. He prevailed below because the cease and desist order against him was denied enforcement. Dismissal of this appeal was neither a final adjudication of the constitutional issues ruled upon in the trial court nor a bar to an action by the owner in the event any act of self-regulation by the Transit Area were to result in an impermissible impairment of his rights.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted the marijuana should have been suppressed as evidence because the police did not lawfully search his bedroom even though they possessed a search warrant, as the warrant was limited in scope for the purpose of finding a stolen deerskin. The court held that the search was constitutionally valid because, even though it would have been unlikely that the deerskin would have been located in defendant's bedroom, the police found drug paraphernalia in his living room while executing a lawful search. Thus, exigent circumstances existed for the search of the bedroom because there was a threat that contraband would have been removed. The record did not affirmatively show that the trial judge threatened defendant with a maximum sentence even though he stated to that he thought defendant should have considered a plea bargain prior to the trial. The record did not show that the trial judge made any implication that the maximum sentence would be imposed upon conviction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant fled the scene and told a witness to call the police because he had just shot someone. Defendant pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Defendant's statements to the state's psychiatrist that indicated that defendant knew the wrongfulness of his of his actions were relayed to the jury. The court held that there was sufficient foundation for the psychiatrist's testimony. The court held that there was sufficient evidence that defendant did know the nature of his act and also knew that it was wrong. The trial court properly instructed the jury that defendant had the burden of proof under Minn. Stat. &sect; 611.026 of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he either did not know the nature of his act or that it was wrong. The trial court's refusal to instruct specifically on the disposition of defendant following a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness was not error. Photographs of the victim were relevant to prove that defendant caused great bodily harm, an element of one of the offenses with which defendant was charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the City of Crystal, Minnesota, its council, and its mayor, sought review of the order of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota), granting plaintiffs, a liquor store proprietor and corporate president and the corporate licensee of a liquor store, an injunction preventing defendants from suspending an off-sale liquor license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suspension occurred after the proprietor's conviction on his guilty plea for selling liquor to a minor in violation of Crystal, Minn., City Code &sect; 1200.35, subd. 2(a). On appeal, the City argued that such an adjudication of guilt constituted a &quot;conviction&quot; within the meaning of Crystal, Minn. City Code &sect; 1200.23, authorizing suspension of licenses upon a violation by an agent of a licensee of the city's liquor sale ordinance, notwithstanding the fact that the sentencing court, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.135, imposed no sentence but stayed imposition for one year. The court reversed the judgment. It held that the term &quot;conviction,&quot; as defined in Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.02, subd. 5, and as implied in Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.135, subd. 2(1), designated the guilt determination only and did not refer to the sentencing procedure. The court reasoned that Crystal, Minn., City Code &sect; 1200.23 was not to be construed to protect those who had been adjudicated guilty, and that in light of the City's broad regulatory powers with respect to liquor licenses, it was inappropriate to rule that a suspension of sentence foreclosed the City's power to suspend a license privilege that it had granted.</SPAN></P>

Defendant refused to certify plaintiff candidate because he would not have been 21 years of age at the time of taking office as required by Minn. Const. art. 7, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff candidate argued that Minn. Const. art. 7, &sect; 6 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by dividing voters into two classes, one of which wished to vote for a candidate 21 years old or older, and one comprised of voters who wished to vote for a younger candidate. The court held that as the establishment of a minimum age was necessary to insure the fitness of those who hold state office, it followed that the attending discrimination between candidates over and those under the minimum age was reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of legitimate state objectives. Plaintiff candidate also contended that art. 7, &sect; 6 divided aspirants to office into a favored class comprising those candidates over 21 years of age and a disfavored class comprising those who were younger. The court held that the state was entitled to set a minimum age for holding office greater than the voting age without violating the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It also held that the Twenty-Sixth Amendment did not require that no person 18 years of age or older be precluded from holding office on account of age and did not supersede Minn.

The court affirmed the first defendant's conviction. The court found that the ordinance was a reasonable exercise of legislative discretion and rejected the first defendant's contention that &sect; 10.01 was void for vagueness because it did not contain a specific definition of &quot;parking lot,&quot; noting that the term had a commonly accepted meaning and had been adequately defined in prior judicial decisions.
