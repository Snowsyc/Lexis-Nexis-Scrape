</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint and argued the following: that the actions fell within the protections of the &quot;anti-SLAPP&quot; statute, that he was an attorney and was immune from liability to third parties for actions taken, and advice given, in furtherance of the representation of his clients, and that the dismissal of the action was proper because there was a prior pending action between the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiff's complaint arose from actions which the defendant alleged took on behalf of client one, and advice given to client two. These two people were the plaintiff's tenants. The plaintiff alleged that the action of filing petitions on behalf of client one was unfair and deceptive acts of practices in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A. The plaintiff further alleged that the he advised client two to withhold her rent. The court found that the filing of motions and appeals fell within Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 59H's definition of petitioning activities. Further, the plaintiff failed to show that the defendant's petitioning activities were devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law. The defendant was entitled to attorney fees and costs in having to defend the plaintiff's claim. As to client two, the court found that the plaintiff would have to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant advised client two. Based on the evidence, the plaintiff would not be able prove that advise was given to client two by the defendant. The court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss as to client one, and entered summary judgment as to client two.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss as to client one because the plaintiff failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the defendant's petitioning activities were substantially devoid of any basis in fact or law. The court entered summary judgment in favor of defendant as to the issues which arose from client two because the plaintiff would not be able to prove that the defendant gave advise to client two.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff moved for attorney fees pursuant to the grant of a motion for summary judgment in which the court found defendant officials of the Massachusetts Department of Corrections excluded plaintiff from observing certain religious observations and declared that that exclusion violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000bb.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the hourly rates for attorney fees under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1997e, did not apply retroactively, it was necessary to separate the time expended by plaintiff's counsel before and after the date of enactment in order to determine appropriate attorney fees. Plaintiff's motion asked that the maximum amount allowable be awarded because of the religious rights vindicated and the time and effort expended and the court concluded the maximum award was reasonable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. Plaintiff's attorney had to learn various aspects of plaintiff's religion as well the recently enacted Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was found unconstitutional during litigation, and the Prison Litigation Reform Act, enacted during litigation. The rate charged by plaintiff's attorney was reasonable for rates in the area and the attorney's experience. Plaintiff's attorney litigated an important religious right in that plaintiff had not been served a brownbag breakfast by prison officials so that the fast required by his religion during daytime could be observed. Therefore the amount requested in plaintiff's motion was approved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prisoner's motion requesting maximum statutory attorney fees was granted because an important right of plaintiff was vindicated by the litigation in which plaintiff prevailed, because the case was made complex by two statutory enactments, one of which was found unconstitutional, and because plaintiff's attorney's fees were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant corrections officers moved for summary judgment in plaintiff inmates' suit for violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1883 and the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 12, &sect; 11I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmates were incarcerated in a prison that had no flush toilets or sinks inside the cells. Plaintiffs sued defendant corrections officers for violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (MCRA), Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 12, &sect; 11I. Defendants moved for summary judgment which the court denied as to the &sect; 1983 claim but granted as to the remaining claims. To succeed on a claim under &sect; 1983, plaintiffs had to prove that defendants acted under color of law and that they deprived plaintiffs of rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States. Defendants could only be liable in so far as plaintiffs proved they were personally involved in depriving them of their constitutional rights. The failure to provide inmates with a toilet that could be flushed from within a cell constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII; therefore, plaintiffs proved a violation of their rights. Defendants were not entitled to immunity because the right they infringed upon was clearly established. Plaintiffs did not prove a violation of the MCRA because they did not allege a threat, intimidation or coercion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant corrections officers' summary judgment motion as to plaintiff inmates' federal civil rights claim but granted it as to all other claims. Plaintiffs' rights under the Eighth Amendment were violated by the prison's failure to provide flush toilets and handwashing sinks in the cells. Plaintiffs did not prove their claim under the state civil rights act because they were not threatened, intimidated, or coerced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant owner had been granted an entertainment license which allowed dancing by performers. Inadvertently, that provision of his license was left out when it was renewed. The owner continued to offer such entertainment without any enforcement action by the commission. When he discovered the error, he applied to have that category restored to his license. At a hearing on the application, members of the commission made statements that there was a rumor the owner was going to try to offer nude dancing. His application was denied. The owner filed a second application for a license which would allow him to present nude dancing. The same day, an ordinance was submitted to the city council to restrict adult entertainment, including nude dancing, to the heavy industrial zone. The application was denied without a hearing, because of the denial of the previous application. Given the commission's previous comments, its reason for denial of the owner's application was a pretext for a prohibited content-based decision. The enactment of the new ordinance was also a purposeful attempt to suppress expression.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, disability retiree and former firefighter, sued defendant, the City of Fitchburg, for its failure to reinstate him to the fire department after a regional medical panel selected by the division of public employee retirement administration determined that he was no longer disabled. The retiree moved for partial summary judgment. The city cross-motioned for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied both motions for summary judgment. The regional medical panel used the previous statutory standard for evaluating whether the retiree was able to return to work, and failed to make the finding required by Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 32, &sect; 8(2), as amended by 1996 Mass. Acts 306, as to whether the retiree could actually execute the required functions of his former job. This failure to make the required finding precluded the retiree's motion for partial summary judgment. None of the four grounds asserted by the city was found by the court to warrant summary judgment. The court found that Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 32, &sect; 8(2), which removed the city's discretion in deciding whether to reinstate the retiree, was constitutional. Since an invalid medical panel review was conducted, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 31 &sect; 39, which would have required retraining, was not triggered. There were no statutorily mandated rights of administrative appeal for the retiree to have exhausted. Finally, the retiree's failure to join the four firefighters whom he claims were wrongly appointed in his stead, was not fatal to his claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motions for summary judgment were denied. The matter was remanded to the division of public employee retirement administration for assembly of a regional medical panel to determine the retiree's eligibility for reinstatement using the proper standard of review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The neighbors owned property adjacent to the property owners, both of which abutted a state highway. Nothing in Mass. Gen.

The owners also had no constitutionally protected property interest implicated by the curb cut permit. Resolution of the claim that the department's guidelines entitled the owners to a hearing took the trial court beyond the pleadings and required consideration of the department's motion to dismiss as a summary judgment motion. The property owners were not entitled to certiorari review of the department's decision to grant a curb cut permit, as the decision was discretionary and required no hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners alleged inverse condemnation by defendants, city and related parties, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and Article 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Both parties sought summary judgment. The owners had intended on developing the property into a marina and waterfront park. They also considered condominiums, which would require rezoning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners contended that there was a taking by the city. The owners alleged that it was not the delay by the city in deciding whether to take the property that constituted the taking. Rather, it was the city's actions, taken to deliberately prevent development of the property with the wrongful purpose of depressing the value so that the property could be taken cheaply in eminent domain. The court found that summary judgment was proper for the city because the owners failed to demonstrate a compensable regulatory taking by the city. There was no evidence that the city was responsible for the environmental assessment made by an independent state agency. There was no evidence to support the contention that the city induced the independent state agency to condition federal permits. The owners failed to meet the burden of showing that the city's refusal to rezone did not substantially advance the city's legitimate interest in maintaining the longstanding zoning status of the property. The city could not be held liable for the environmental scoping decision's impact on the property value when the owners failed to prove that the city's comments were the cause of the decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoners first requested to enjoin the sheriff from forcing persons placed in custody, including pregnant women, to sleep on mattresses or hard plastic shells placed on the floor. Because they had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of the claim, and the balancing of the harm to the parties favored granting injunctive relief under the factual circumstances, the court approved the injunction. The prisoners also requested an injunction from confining for more than 10 hours per day any person in a cell where there was less than 35 square feet of unencumbered floor space for each person housed in the cell. The court ordered the sheriff to house only one inmate per cell at the jail, further enjoined triple bunking inmates in the house of correction, and ordered the use of floor mattresses and portable bunks in the units ceased. The court was not willing to enjoin the sheriff from housing local arrestees because it was within his discretion to do so, but the sheriff was enjoined from automatically reserving 30 cells for regional arrestees.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Law ch. 231, &sect; 59H. The owners brought suit against defendant condominium trustees for interference with business relations and with contractual relations, slander and defamation, breach of fiduciary duties, civil conspiracy, and unfair and deceptive practices, and asked for a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A number of people with other units in the complex did not want the owners there, and engaged in activity, such as petitioning a government agency to refrain from selling them units in the complex. The court explained that the statute's intent was to not to dismiss meritorious claims with a substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities implicated. Thus, a party who sought to have a claim dismissed under the Anti-SLAPP Act had to make a threshold showing, through the pleadings and affidavits, that the claims against it were based on petitioning activities alone and had no substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities. Once the party filing the motion made this showing, the burden then shifted to the opposing party to show that the exercise of its right to petition by the party filing the motion was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law and that party's acts caused actual injury to the opposing party. Applying the test, the court vacated its dismissal of the owners' request for a declaratory judgment and claim of breach of fiduciary duty regarding allocation of parking places.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the period of probation the Massachusetts legislature enacted the DNA Seizure and Dissemination Act (Act), Mass.

A sample was not collected from defendant in the authorized 90 day period, but when defendant sought to terminate his probation at the expiration of the term, the Probation Department asserted that the failure to have a sample collected constituted a violation of the Act which in turn authorized the refusal of termination of probation. The court allowed the motion to terminate probation because it determined that since the number of days on which the collection of DNA could be made was minimal in light of court actions regarding the propriety of the Act, and the cut-off date for the samples that did not contain and extension, there was no violation that affected the term of probation. The court determined that the probation department did not have discretion under the terms of Mass. Super. Ct.

The matter came before the court for consideration of defendant's amended motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred, inter alia, in empanelling an anonymous jury and in failing to instruct the jury on the presumption that an accused was innocent until proven guilty. The commonwealth argued, inter alia, that the claim of error with respect to empanelment of an anonymous jury had to be tested by the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice standard. The court allowed defendant's amended motion for a new trial. The court found that on the facts of the case, empanelment of an anonymous jury without any reason for suspecting that withholding the jurors' identities was essential to protect them from harm or improper influence, without any cautionary instructions, and without a thorough voir dire warranted a new trial. The court reasoned that the mandatory language of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 277, &sect; 66 entitled defendant to a list of jurors; thus, grant of the motion with respect to the armed robbery conviction was warranted without a showing of actual prejudice. The court further found that application of the substantial risk of miscarriage of justice standard was not warranted because defendant had not waived his claims, but had preserved them for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The liquor store was located in a town no part of which was within 10 miles of the New Hampshire border. ABCC suspended the liquor store's license to sell alcoholic beverages because the store knowingly sold liquor on Sunday in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 136, &sect; 5 (the Sunday Closing Law). The liquor store sought judicial review claiming that the Sunday Closing Law violated its right to equal protection of the laws and due process under the U.S. and Massachusetts Constitutions. The court granted the liquor store's motion for judgment on the pleadings and set aside the ABCC suspension. The prohibition on Sunday sales of alcoholic beverages denied the liquor store equal protection because a statutory exception from the prohibition for stores located in towns that were within 10 miles of the New Hampshire border, regardless of the stores' distance from that border, was not rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate government purpose and was arbitrary. It also violated principles of due process under both constitutions because it did not bear a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or some other phase of the general welfare.</SPAN></P>

The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss and to disqualify counsel. The court held that defendant had not been deprived of his fundamental right to a disinterested prosecutor because the association had no choice regarding their funding of the fraud division, the fraud division received no benefit from its prosecutions, and fraud division lawyers made the decision to prosecute, not the IFB.

Petitioner's commitment to DYS was extended twice.

Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus, and DYS filed a motion to dismiss. The court denied both requests. Because petitioner would not have been eligible for immediate release if he were successful on the merits of the allegations set forth in the petition, the court treated the petition as a complaint for declaratory judgment. The court found that DYS was permitted to transfer petitioner to the Department of Corrections pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 120, &sect; 19 based on the determination that petitioner was a threat to others. Also, the transfer did not violate petitioner's rights to equal protection and due process. Petitioner's sentence extension by DYS was not a sentence imposed by a court, and petitioner was not &quot;incarcerated&quot; by virtue of the transfer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner contended that he was not subject to the terms of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 22E because, although he previously was convicted of an offense listed in Ch. 22E, he was currently incarcerated because of his conviction for a crime that was not listed in Ch. 22E. Twelve and one-half years before the statute became effective, the prisoner was convicted of armed robbery, a listed offense, and was sentenced to 6 to 15 years in the state prison. The prisoner &quot;wrapped up&quot; that sentence and was discharged. The prisoner was presently incarcerated for a crime that was not listed in ch. 22E. The court allowed the prisoner's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court held that 1997 Mass. Acts 106, &sect; 8 did not apply to the prisoner because he was not incarcerated for a listed offense on the date that the statute went into effect. The court held that the submission of blood samples was limited to those who were incarcerated for a listed offense on the effective date. The court reasoned that its construction of the statute was consistent with the statutory language and allowed the statute to serve as a rational mechanism for implementing a sample collection scheme.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner appealed unsuccessfully to one of the prison officials. The prisoner filed suit and filed a motion for summary judgment. The prison officials filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The court denied all parties' motions regarding the prisoner's claim under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (MCRA), and granted in part and denied in part all remaining motions. The court held that the MCRA claim was properly dismissed because the guilty findings of the Disciplinary Board were not reversed or declared invalid. The court held that prison officials' actions were an exaggerated response to the prisoner's letter and violated his First Amendment and due process rights, as there was insufficient evidence that the prisoner's words constituted a threat.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant's random policy only tested select employees, like plaintiff, who were in safety sensitive positions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sex offender filed an action challenging his classification as a high risk offender by defendant, Sex Offender Registry Board (board), pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration and Community Notification Act (Act), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, &sect;&sect; 178C-178O. The sex offender sought a preliminary injunction barring the board from requiring him to register under the Act and disseminating any sex offender registration information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sex offender filed an action against the board, contesting the level at which he was classified pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6, &sect; 178K. The sex offender was subject to the Act, having been convicted of rape of a child, indecent assault and battery of a child under 14, and unnatural and lascivious acts. In accordance with the Act, the sex offender registered with the local police department. In response to a decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, the sex offender sought a preliminary injunction which would bar the board from (a) requiring the sex offender to continue registering under the Act and (b) disseminating any sex offender registration information concerning the sex offender. The board opposed the injunction. The court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the board from disseminating any sex offender registry information pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 6 &sect;&sect; 178I and 178J until the sex offender had a meaningful hearing. The court however, denied the preliminary injunction as to the registration requirements of the Act, finding that the sex offender would not suffer irreparable harm by continuing to register with the police department.</SPAN></P>

The court, however, otherwise denied the sex offender's motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that there was no irreparable harm from requiring him to continue to register.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the parents of children who were of compulsory school age desired to teach their children at home, the school district approved their home schooling applications. However, the parents refused to consent to the school district's requirement of home visits. The parents alleged that home visits were not within the school district's authority and violated their First and Fourth Amendment rights. The court granted summary judgment to the school district, holding that while the school district could not unduly hamper the constitutionally protected decision on how to educate one's children, the twice-yearly visits were a reasonable regulation that furthered the compelling government interest of education. The visits were plainly within the school district's statutory authority, and they constituted a minimal intrusion into the parents' home. Additionally, these home visits were not unconstitutional where they did not infringe on the parents' freedom of religion, and they did not constitute illegal searches.</SPAN></P>

At the time of the alleged assaults, the victim was between the ages of 10 and 12. Defendant argued that the statute of limitations set forth in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 277, &sect; 63 had run, that the tolling provision of &sect; 63 had not applied to the rape charges, and that even if the tolling provision had not applied, the provision was unconstitutional, as it violated the Equal Protection and Privileges and Immunities clauses of the United States Constitution and Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 1 by abridging his right to travel and to a fair trial. After a hearing, the court dismissed the motions, holding that defendant had conceded that the tolling provision applied to both the rape and indecent assault and battery charges. Thus, when defendant left Massachusetts for New Hampshire, the six-year statute of limitations was tolled for both offenses. The court found that as a result of that tolling, the rape charge was not stale at the time any of the subsequent amendments had taken effect, and the revised statutes of limitations applied to that offense. The court held that the right to travel was not absolute.</SPAN></P>

According to the court, the repayment of the loans of the mother's husband constituted a &quot;transfer&quot; within the meaning of the &quot;Transfer of Assets&quot; regulation, Mass. Regs.

The citizen wrote a summary of what he had heard prior to his call to the police department. The citizen then, in a log format, noted a series of telephone conversations that he later picked up on the scanner. The citizen decided on his own to continue listening for telephone conversations and to record them. The citizen gave the police department his summary, the log, and a tape recording of conversations. Defendant filed a motion to suppress. The court allowed defendant's motion to suppress evidence as to the log, but denied the motion in all other respects. The summary and the recording were not made at the direction of the police; thus, no state action was involved. State action was involved in the making of the log.

Both the developers and the town filed motions for summary judgment under Mass. R. Civ. P. 56, and the developers filed a motion for additional discovery under Mass. R. Civ. P. 56(f).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town implemented various user and impact fees including a sprinkler/hydrant fee, a schools impact fee, a sewer system entry fee, and a lift station donation fee. The developers sought a declaration that the fees were unconstitutional and unenforceable exactions and sought to recover the amount of all invalid fees that were paid. The court held that in order to determine if a fee was proper, it would analyze the fee under the following factors: whether the fee was charged for a particular governmental service which benefited the party paying the fee in a different manner; whether they were paid by choice; and whether the fees were collected to compensate the government entity for its expenses in providing the service. Applying that analysis, the court held that the water/ hydrant fee was a legitimate fee and that summary judgment on that fee should be allowed for the town. The court held that the schools impact fee was not a legitimate fee, and was in fact an unauthorized tax, and summary judgment was entered in favor of the developers. The court granted the developers' motion for additional discovery under Rule 56(f) before ruling on the other two challenged assessments.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the policy violated the inmates' right to privacy in conversations with the clergy and mental health professionals, and ordered the DOC to provide private access to these individuals. However, the court found no violation of the state or federal wiretapping statutes because all parties were informed of and consented to the policy, and therefore monitoring was not done in secret. The court found that the policy did not violate the Administrative Procedure Act because the DOC gave notice and a hearing and filed a fiscal impact statement with the secretary of state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a police department did not violate the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, or ch. 151B by requiring an officer to submit to medical exams, as there was no premium on preventing disclosure of a disability where the disability was already known. The police department knew that the officer had been disabled and was justified in requiring the exams to determine whether or not his disabilities would prevent him from performing the duties of a police officer. The court found that the police department was in violation of 1996 Mass. Acts 306 by refusing to reinstate the officer after his disability had ended. In so holding, the court concluded that 1996 Mass. Acts 306 abrogated the police commissioner's discretion in reinstating retired members to duty. Accordingly, the officer had to be reappointed following the regional medical panel's certification that he was no longer disabled. Lastly, 1996 Mass. Acts 306 applied, as the officer's renewed demand for reinstatement after the date of the amendment to Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 32, &sect; 8 was equivalent to re-application after the amendment.</SPAN></P>

Having found such issues of fact, the court addressed the newsworthiness defense, holding that the newspaper and reporter met their burden of showing an absence of any factual dispute regarding whether the information disclosed about the physician was newsworthy. In holding that the information was newsworthy as a matter of law, the court concluded that the subject matter was of public concern, and the specific facts disclosed about the physician were closely related to the matter of public concern. The court declined to recognize a private right of action against the newspaper and reporter for obtaining and disseminating material covered by the medical peer review statute,&nbsp;Mass.  Gen.

The court reviewed the five cases and held that it was undisputed that the five patients received inpatient services and that the division's decisions in each case was based on an unlawful procedure. Additionally, the court held that the division's program was unconstitutionally vague because the division failed to delineate the standard by which it determined whether an invoice was properly submitted on an inpatient basis or on an outpatient basis.

Civ. P. 15(a) allowed the amendments which strengthened the town's standing but denied the ones adding parties that did not have standing. The court also granted the trust's motion to dismiss the complaint as to the spot zoning and/or contract zoning claim, finding that to have permitted the town to have standing to bring a spot-zoning challenge would have expanded the cause of action beyond the existing case law. The court however denied the motion as to all the other claims, finding that the town did have standing to challenge the zoning because it abutted the neighboring town. Moreover, the court held that the town's allegation of unconstitutional contract zoning failed to state a cognizable claim because it did not allege that the rezoning of the land was conditioned on extraneous considerations.

The court reasoned that there was clear and unambiguous language, evidenced by the terms &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;unless,&quot; which required that all uniformed members of the Department attained a passing score of at least 70 percent on a written promotional examination before being eligible for a promotion. The court denied the motion on issue related to timely promotions because the court found that the colonel promulgated a general order that allowed him to postpone promotions for certain Departmental needs, and Mass.

The court held that the bank had failed to carry its burden of showing the severity of its economic loss, had no reasonable expectation that it would have taken the land without being subject to the ordinance in question, and a reduction in the number of houses that the owner could build was a diminution in value and not a taking.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found plaintiff to be a sexually dangerous person (SDP) and committed him to a treatment center for an indefinite term, under chapter 123A. Plaintiff was able to petition the trial court each year for discharge from the treatment center. During his commitment, the legislature amended chapter 123A by determining that no new SDPs would be admitted to the treatment center and that control of the treatment center was transferred from the department of mental health to the department of correction. Plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of the amendments, but the court granted the superintendent's motion to dismiss. The court held that at the time of plaintiff's commitment, chapter 123A applied equally to him as well as to other SDPs. The amended chapter 123A also applied equally to all currently committed SDPs. Regardless of which department controlled the treatment center, the commitment was civil in nature; therefore, double jeopardy and ex post facto clauses did not apply.

Defendants filed motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. The court explained that the Declaratory Judgment Act, Mass. Gen.

The landowners' complaint contained conclusory allegations about potential future conflicts, not facts that if true would entitle them to relief. The court dismissed the first count.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on three counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of 14 and five counts of rape of a child. Defendant filed motions to dismiss the indictments on the ground that they were barred by the statute of limitations of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 277, &sect; 63.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the limitations period was tolled by the period of time that defendant resided outside of Massachusetts. Defendant argued that the placement of a punctuation mark in the text of the statute supported an inference that the Massachusetts Legislature intended to limit its applicability to offenses less serious than rape. However, the statutory revisions evidenced legislative intent to allow for a greater period to prosecute the crimes for which defendant was charged. Thus, a fair and rational reading of ch. 277, &sect; 63 warranted the applicability of the tolling provision to all of the charges alleged. Defendant's constitutional challenges also failed. First, defendant failed to offer any evidence that his ability to mount a defense was prejudiced by the delay, or that the delay was intentionally or recklessly caused by the prosecution. Second, the tolling provision did not violate defendant's right to travel because it was rationally related to the State's legitimate interest of assuring that one who committed a crime remain in the state to enhance detection and identification and to minimize extradition expenses. Thus, defendant's motions were denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff juvenile entered a negotiated plea to the crime of rape of a child under the age of 16, relying on the confidentiality provisions of Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Sex Offender Registration, Community Notification Act (Act), Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 6, &sect; 178C et seq. (1996), was passed, the juvenile was notified that the state intended to prosecute him for failure to register as a sex offender. The juvenile filed suit, alleging that the Act as applied to him was unconstitutional, violating the ex post facto and double jeopardy provisions of the federal and Massachusetts constitutions. The court held that the Act was regulatory rather than punitive, so retroactive application did not violate the ex post facto prohibition, and that the statutory intent was not punishment, so its application to the juvenile violated neither the double jeopardy nor cruel and usual punishment prohibitions. The court held that the public's access to sex offender registration information was limited, the Act's scheme for release of the information was rationally related to the act's goal of protecting members of the public who were in especially vulnerable situations. The court held that the juvenile had no constitutional right of confidentiality and that it was within the legislature's power to remove the statutorily created confidentiality.</SPAN></P>

The judgment debtors argued that Massachusetts law did not recognize confessions of judgment and that the lack of notice violated due process. The court granted summary judgment to the trust company, denied the judgment debtors motion for summary judgment, and stayed the execution of the judgment against the wife pending the outcome of her federal court appeal of the denial of her motion to vacate the judgment. The confessions of judgment were found to be proper under Virginia law and were therefore entitled to full faith and credit in Massachusetts, regardless of the fact that confession of judgment clauses were void in Massachusetts. U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1 required full faith and credit be given to the sister state judgments without inquiry into the merits of the cause of action. Because it was valid in Virginia the judgment was entitled to full faith and credit. However, because the judgment was not final with regard to the wife, execution as to her was stayed pending the outcome of her federal court appeal.</SPAN></P>

The commonwealth sought to change the date of commencement of the stalking because the crime of stalking was defined after the first incident. The court found that the status of the indictment was unconstitutional as an ex post facto charge. The court granted the motion to amend the indictment because there was the possibility of double jeopardy if defendant were acquitted under the original indictment. Furthermore, there was sufficient evidence from which the grand jury could have found probable cause to believe that defendant committed two or more acts of harassment.

The court held that under current administrative procedures, the nursing home had to demonstrate that it was an aggrieved party once the proceedings before the commission concluded.

The court issued a preliminary injunction because a defendant convicted and punished for an offense could not have a nonremedial civil penalty imposed against him for the same offense in a separate action and the double assessment imposed under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62C, &sect; 28 was punitive. The court determined that the assessment of interest under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62C, &sect; 32 for the period that the original taxes had not been paid was remedial because it sought to make the government whole and that the penalty assessed under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62C, &sect; 33a for filing late returns did not constitute successive punishment for the same offense because it was for different conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff national trade association whose members operated truck fleets, brought an action challenging a regulation promulgated by defendant Massachusetts Commissioner of Revenue and alleged that 830 Code Mass. Regs. 63.39.1(5) (1993) (the regulation), which applied Massachusetts corporate net income tax to certain foreign corporations using Massachusetts roadways to transact business, violated 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 381.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged regulation imposed income taxes on corporations who made business decisions to conduct transactions across interstate lines using private trucks, instead of common carriers, to deliver their goods into Massachusetts. The court found that Congress enacted 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 381 to protect corporations from being taxed by a state when its only contact with that state was solicitation of goods, and shipment or delivery of those goods from a point outside the taxing state. The court found that compliance with both statutes was not physically impossible, but that the regulation stood as an obstacle to the purposes and objectives of the federal legislation. The court determined that 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 381 was intended as a provision for tax immunity for businesses engaged solely in certain activities, rather than a grant of authority under which a state could levy a tax. The court held that the association had met its burden of proof by demonstrating that the regulation placed tax liability on a foreign corporation which would otherwise be immune under &sect; 381. This exercise of the Commonwealth's tax jurisdiction conflicted with the purpose and policies behind the enactment of &sect; 381.</SPAN></P>

The citizens contended that the city illegally contracted, designed, and built the sewer system in violation of the city charter. The action was removed to federal court. The federal judge issued a partial judgment and remanded, finding that the citizens were too late in challenging the city's project because the sewer system was already constructed. In denying the citizen's petition, the court found that the citizens should have filed their action prior to the time the city incurred the obligation to pay for the sewer. The court held that the citizens had standing to challenge the sewer project before such obligation was incurred and not afterwards. The obligation to pay for the sewer system existed, so that the citizens could not now allege that the construction of the sewer system was in violation of the city's charter.</SPAN></P>

Once classification information was disseminated to the public, no judicial remedy was available to correct an erroneous classification. The CPCS filed a motion for a preliminary injunction limited to the single issue of whether the sex offenders were entitled to an injunction prohibiting the board from disseminating information before the court ruled on the sex offenders' complaints for judicial review. The court allowed the motion for a preliminary injunction because the sex offenders had established that they would suffer irreparable harm if injunctive relief had not been granted. The court found that the process afforded to sexual offenders prior to dissemination of their classifications was insufficient to meet constitutional requirements of due process. The court concluded that the legislature intended that dissemination be stayed pending judicial review.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's admission that he was using an unauthorized password to access the computer system precluded him from arguing that he did not understand what conduct was prohibited under &sect; 120F. Also, the court found that the commonwealth did not abuse its discretion by charging defendant with only 44 counts representing the number of days that he accessed the confidential files, rather than with 3,504 counts for the number of times the computer system was accessed. The prosecution had discretion on what charges to bring, and defendant did not suffer any prejudice. Further, defendant was not subject to cruel and unusual punishment. The hospital patient files accessed by defendant were confidential, &sect; 120F imposed the shortest term of imprisonment of any Massachusetts criminal statute except the motor vehicle laws, and &sect; 120F was comparable to similar statutes in other jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>

However, plaintiffs were welcome to reapply for service on the &quot;adult&quot; exchange if they wished to do so. Plaintiffs responded by filing a nine-count complaint alleging various federal and state claims. The court entered a partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, holding that defendant's presumptive blocking violated US. Const. amends. I, XIV and 42 U.S.C.S. 1983 because it was not the least restrictive means to further a compelling governmental interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors. Voluntary blocking was significantly less restrictive than presumptive blocking because it would give parents the ability to control their children's access to adult programming, without limiting the availability of that programming to adults. Moreover, the fact that voluntary blocking might allow children to have indirect access to indecent communications provided no adequate justification for placing greater burdens on adults' access to protected speech.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant's conviction and the denial of defendant's motion for a new trial were affirmed. Defendant filed a second motion for a new trial. The court denied the motion. The court determined that defendant's challenge to the trial judge's reasonable doubt instruction was based on recent decisions criticizing the use of the phrase &quot;moral certainty.&quot; The court determined that it was without discretion to deny a hearing where defendant could not be viewed as having waived this issue because he challenged the language in his previous motion at a time when the phrase &quot;moral certainty&quot; was considered beneficial and able to overcome isolated inadequacies in an explanation of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court had given retroactive effect to the new interpretation of &quot;moral certainty&quot; in collateral attacks.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to suppress cash seized from his person and contraband seized from the ground following his arrest for trespass that led to charges for drug related offenses and for assault and battery on a police officer. Defendant also sought to suppress a statement made at the scene of the arrest and a statement made during his booking at the police station.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted as grounds for the motions, that there was no probable cause to arrest him and, thus, that the physical evidence and statements were required to be suppressed as &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree.&quot; In addition, defendant argued that his statements must be suppressed because no Miranda warnings were given. The court denied the motion to suppress cash and contraband, and granted in part the motion to suppress statements. In so holding, the court determined that after defendant was informed that he was under arrest, defendant's attack on a police officer that occurred before the search provided a wholly independent reason to believe that defendant had committed a crime, namely assault and battery upon a police officer, providing independent probable cause for arrest. The court concluded that the attack was an intervening event that broke the chain of causation and dissipated the taint of the prior illegality. Defendant's statement to the booking officer concerning his employment should have been suppressed because it was potentially incriminating and the police did not give warnings to defendant before asking him about his employment status.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to suppress was denied. Defendant's motion to suppress statements of defendant was denied with respect to the statements made at the scene of defendant's arrest, and it was allowed with respect to the statements made at the police department during booking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sisters sought a preliminary injunction prohibiting defendant state officials from disseminating to any public or private person or agency the fact that abuse prevention orders ever were issued against them. The sisters sued, challenging the constitutionality of an act establishing a statewide registration of domestic violence offenses (the Act), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 188, &sect; 7 (1992).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sisters claimed that the Act facially violated their constitutional rights to due process of law and, alternatively, that it was unconstitutional as applied. They alleged that maintaining records of the fact that abuse prevention orders were issued against them and the possibility that such records would be made available to others through a registry was damaging because it labeled them as dangerous. The court concluded that the sisters failed to demonstrate a substantial risk of irreparable harm. The court found that the Act did not purport to provide the public with access to the registry and the sisters' concern that the information might be disseminated to the public was unwarranted. Furthermore, the court found that the sisters' worry that the data might be misused by a judge in some future abuse hearing was nothing more than speculation about the possibility of harm, not a showing that they would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief. Additionally, the court concluded that the sisters failed to demonstrate a likelihood that they would prevail on the merits of their claim that the registry was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 143, &sect; 51, as amended by 1972 Mass. Acts 802, &sect; 35, and the State Building Code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After disagreements between the subcontractor and the drywaller, of which the company's foreman was advised, the drywaller shot the subcontractor in the hand with a nail gun. The court ruled that the State Building Code imposed on the company, as the general contractor, the duty to maintain a reasonably safe workplace. Therefore, summary judgment was denied as to the subcontractor's claim based on the company's own negligence. Also, whether the drywaller shot the subcontractor accidentally or intentionally, the company owed a common law duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors to prevent injury by a third person. The reasonable foreseeability of harm and whether the subcontractor broke the causal connection if he provoked the drywaller were questions for the finder of fact and summary judgment was denied on that theory also. The court ruled that ch. 143, &sect; 51, as amended, incorporated the State Building Code, and, therefore, the company, the party in control of the building, was liable for damages caused by a violation of the provisions that related to the particular type of building involved. The company's motion for summary judgment on the issue was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A project labor agreement required by an awarding authority as a condition for contracts on a large public works project contained a provision mandating that contractors recognize the union as exclusive collective bargaining representative and also a no-strike clause. A nonprofit corporation representing contractors requested a preliminary injunction to prevent the awarding authority from issuing a bid specification, but that relief was denied. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the court ruled that: 1) the awarding authority did not unconstitutionally usurp the legislature's function because the legislature decided the policy and standards for the project; 2) a private construction manager was properly authorized to negotiate the project labor agreement, as the awarding authority retained the power to approve the final agreement; 3) Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 150E did not apply to private employees; 4) the Prevailing Wage Rate Law, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 149, &sect; 26, and competitive bidding laws were not violated because the project labor agreement did not create a union preference; and 5) the interest of a bidder did not amount to a constitutionally protected property interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were incarcerated in the county jail. Plaintiffs filed separate claims challenging the procedure by which the county officials revoked statutory good time credits that would have been applied to their sentences. Plaintiffs and the county officials moved for summary judgment as to liability in each case. In one case the commissioner also moved for summary judgment. The court held that the county officials deprived plaintiffs of their rights to procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The county commissioners, on their own initiative, without the required recommendations from the disciplinary officers involved and without any notice to plaintiffs, revoked nearly 200 days of statutory credits to their sentences. These actions violated plaintiffs' rights to procedural due process. Plaintiffs were therefore entitled to summary judgment against the county officials on their 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims. There was no evidence that the commissioner failed to perform his own statutory duties; therefore, the commissioner was subject to suit for damages in his personal capacity but he was protected in such a suit by the doctrine of qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court allowed each plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment as to liability of the county officials.

The cable company had a right of access to the premises of the residential complex. The court also stated that the voiding of the exclusivity provision as a result of Mass. Gen.

Code tit. 430, &sect; 4.04(8), which effectively removed an interim period by authorizing a reduction of weekly unemployment compensation where the applicant became entitled to pension payments during the period from the beginning of the base period through the end of the benefit year was invalid, as an ultra vires regulation that deprived them of property rights. The Commissioner contended that the regulation was valid and that, in any event, the retroactive amendment of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151A, &sect; 29(d)(6) by 1994 Mass. Acts 260, &sect;&sect; 5, 7 mooted the regulation and thereby mooted plaintiffs' action for declaratory relief. The court concluded that the equities decidedly tipped against retroactive application of the statute so that it was unreasonable and hence invalid. With respect to the motion for judgment on the administrative record, in issue was whether the regulation required plaintiffs' unemployment benefits to be reduced. The Board of Review held that unemployment benefits should not be reduced, notwithstanding Mass. Regs. Code tit. 430, &sect; 4.04(8). The court agreed and upheld the decision of the Board.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the motion to dismiss, finding that because the action involved a claim of entitlement to immediate release from prison, a petition for habeas corpus was the proper procedure to challenge the disciplinary proceedings.

The court held that such tests constituted nothing more than real or physical evidence and did not trigger the protections afforded by the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V, and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The court granted the motion to suppress with respect to the recitation of the alphabet because an inability to recite the alphabet was reflective of the knowledge, understanding, and thought process of a suspect; hence, it was a form of testimonial communication.</SPAN></P>

In the manager's slander and libel action against the employee, the court denied the manager's request for a ruling as a matter of law that he was not a public official or a public figure and that the employee was required to prove the truth of his allegedly defamatory statements as an affirmative defense to the manager's claims. The court declined to rule upon the manager's status as a public official because relevant facts concerning the manager's government duties had not yet been established. After analyzing federal and state case law precedent and the public policy promoting free speech of all citizens, the court held that, in the context of speech involving matters of public concern, the burden of proving the falsity of an allegedly defamatory statement fell upon a private-figure plaintiff in an action against a non-media defendant.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff's complaint, which he filed pro se, essentially set forth an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, that as a result of the department's action, his constitutional rights were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was convicted of child abuse and sentenced. His convictions were not reversed and no new trial was ever granted. He alleged that he was wrongly convicted due to a conspiracy by the department to withhold exculpatory evidence relating to the child abuse charges. The court granted the department's motion to dismiss plaintiff's claims. The court construed plaintiff's complaint as asserting violations of &sect; 1983, and the state civil rights act. The court held that a litigant has no cause of action under &sect; 1983 for unconstitutional imprisonment unless the conviction has been reversed under a direct appeal, or otherwise declared invalid. Thus, the court ruled, plaintiff had no cognizable claim under either &sect; 1983 or the state civil rights act because his convictions had not been reversed. The court further found that to the extent that plaintiff asserted a violation of the state tort claims act for malicious prosecution or false imprisonment, he failed to comply with the act's requirement as to notice of his claim, therefore, his claims had to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance prohibited an adult entertainment special permit for any building located within a radius of 500 feet of a residential district, a school, or a church. Because the owner's nightclub was 430 feet from a church, the city council could not issue it an adult entertainment permit. The owner argued that the ordinance violated its free speech rights because it lacked specific standards for issuing permits. The court held that the owner lacked standing to challenge the provisions applicable to establishments that met the district and distance requirements. It did not operate any establishment in the city that was within the permissible geographic areas for adult entertainment. The owner's interests had not been threatened by the presence or absence of standards for issuing permits to eligible applicants. Due to the owner's particular location, the city council had no authority to issue it an adult entertainment permit regardless of what standards were applied to geographically eligible establishments. The owner's lack of standing precluded a constitutional challenge to the remainder of the ordinance under both the United States Constitution and Mass. Const. art. 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the owner's application for a permanent injunction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tenants notified the building manager that a lock in their apartment was defective. The manager failed to fix or replace the lock, and one of the tenants was prevented from immediately exiting the apartment when a fire occurred in one of the bedrooms. Tenant's infant son was killed in the fire. A jury returned a verdict in favor of the tenants on claims for negligence and breach of warranty of habitability. The court denied motions by the manager and a related corporation for judgment n.o.v. or, in the alternative, for a new trial, and to vacate or remit the award of compensatory and punitive damages. The evidence was sufficient to support a jury determination that defendants were on notice of the condition of the lock, had a duty to remedy the problem, and consciously chose not to take any action, and this conduct was a substantial cause of the tenants' injuries. The statute providing for a minimum award of damages where a death was caused by gross negligence was not unconstitutional. Instructions on spoliation, and that the jury could draw an adverse inference from the defendants' failure to call a witness who was in their control and available, were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother appealed from a final administrative decision by defendant, the Department of Social Services (Massachusetts), to list the mother on the Department's registry of alleged perpetrators of sexual abuse. Pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 30A, &sect; 14(7), the mother claimed that her substantial rights were prejudiced because the Department's decision was not supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department investigated a report that the mother had sexually abused her son. On the basis of that investigation, the Department informed the mother that her name would be placed on the central registry of alleged perpetrators of sexual abuse. The mother argued that the Department's decision to list her on the central registry was unsupported by substantial evidence because the son's psychological testing concluded that the perpetrator of the sexual abuse was a male, a sex offender evaluation concluded that she was a low risk to molest her son, and she won legal and physical custody of her son in her divorce action. The Department's decision was affirmed. The court found that the son's graphic disclosures during the initial investigation strongly pointed to the mother as a perpetrator of sexual abuse. As such, the disclosures constituted substantial evidence to support the Department's decision to list the mother on the registry. The sex offender evaluation, the psychological reports, or the custody decision did not undermine the evidence because none of that information negated the possibility that the mother was a perpetrator of sexual abuse against the son.</SPAN></P>

The video store then moved for a preliminary injunction, while the city and city officials moved to consolidate the motion with a trial on the merits.

The court held that (1) the ordinances at issue created unreasonable time, place, and manner regulations on the video store, (2) the video store had therefore demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, (3) there was also a likelihood of irreparable harm to the video store if the ordinances were enforced, and (4) because of the other adult video stores in the city, the harm to the city in allowing the video store to operate was clearly less than any harm that might be caused to the video store if the ordinances were enforced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustees filed an action against the commissioners after they denied the trustees' proposed development on property within the area under the commissioners' control. The trustees alleged that in denying the development the commissioners acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and &sect; 1983. The commissioners filed a motion to dismiss that count of the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court allowed the motion to dismiss. The rejection of the trustees' development plan did not implicate substantive due process. The trustees' claims had not established the requisite abuse of government power and were insufficient to state a claim for federal constitutional relief warranting &sect; 1983 relief against the commissioners. Massachusetts law was fully equipped to provide the trustees with any remedy to which they might ultimately have been entitled. It was not enough to allege arbitrary and capricious behavior by the commissioners. The conduct of the commissioners was not extremely egregious or conscience shocking as required for a successful substantive due process claim in the land planning dispute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's indictment tracked the language and punctuation of &sect; 18C. Defendant asserted that an omitted comma in &sect; 18C made criminal liability contingent on the conduct of another person, and therefore failed to give fair warning of the activity prohibited by the statute. Thus, defendant contended that &sect; 18C was facially void for vagueness. Defendant claimed that &sect; 18C was overbroad because it purported to criminalize the making of threats. Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment was denied. The absence of proper punctuation in &sect; 18C did not render the statute facially void for vagueness. The court remedied the apparent grammatical flaw by inserting a comma before the phrase &quot;while armed with a dangerous weapon.&quot; The court did not address defendant's contention that &sect; 18C was unconstitutionally vague as applied because defendant did not present a statement of facts necessary for a resolution of that claim. The court concluded that &sect; 18C was not unconstitutionally overbroad because the Commonwealth's threats statute had already survived an overbreadth challenge.</SPAN></P>

One of the prisoners moved the court to amend its prior judgment and the court decreed that the prisoner was entitled to wear the medallion and that the regulation was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court found that the regulation banned all symbolic expression subject to the superintendent's unfettered discretion. The court determined that as there was no evidence that the wearing of the medallions caused any internal problems in the prison, the limitation on the prisoner's freedom of speech exceeded that necessary to preserve institutional security and order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former student brought a knife to school that appeared to be a lipstick holder. Defendants, school administrators and officials, expelled plaintiff under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 71, &sect; 37H, after a hearing. The court entered judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiff's 16-count complaint. The court held defendants' actions were not an abuse of discretion under &sect; 37H and that the knife was not a novelty item, but a statutory dangerous weapon. The court ruled that although public education was a property interest, plaintiff was not denied procedural due process. The court ruled that under common law, education was not a fundamental right and &sect; 37H passed the rational basis test; therefore, the statute was not in violation of plaintiff's substantive due process or equal protection rights. The court further held expulsion and the statute were not violative of plaintiff's substantive due process and equal protection rights under the state constitution. The court found that the statute was not void due to vagueness and, because there was no violation of statutory or constitutional rights, civil rights claims were not meritorious.</SPAN></P>

P. 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff classes challenged the contract between defendant state university and defendant city school committee which brought defendant university in to help manage the public school system. They claimed that the arrangement was unconstitutional on a number of grounds. The court found that there was jurisdiction to sue under the ten taxpayer statute,&nbsp;Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 40, &sect; 53, and the anti-aid amendment to the constitution, Mass. Const. art. amend. 18, 2. The court found that there was a private right to sue under the Transitional Bilingual Education Act. The court concluded that defendant university was a public agent. It analyzed the delegation of power to defendant university under a three part test, finding that the legislature made a fundamental policy decision that the public schools offered unacceptably low levels of educational opportunity, that the directives provided adequate direction for implementation, and provided safeguards such that abuses of discretion could be controlled. Further, the decision was rationally related to the its legitimate interest in ensuring that children receive an education. Therefore, the court found that the delegation was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that the statute was constitutionally deficient because it did not define the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. The court agreed that by contrast, all the other sections of the drug statute that carried mandatory minimum sentences stated: &quot;No sentence imposed under the provisions of this section shall be for less than a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of &quot; The court found that it was only subsection (d) that omitted the language defining what the mandatory minimum term was. Applying the authority, the court held that subsection (d) could be read to give effect to its terms without requiring speculation as to the penalty involved. The court concluded that the legislature had obviously omitted language by mistake that it intended to include, i.e. the definition of the length of the mandatory minimum term. The court determined that the oversight need not, however, render the entire subsection void. Rather, the court held that the omission could be cured by simply not applying the minimum mandatory language.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family members filed a complaint arising out of defendants' rule prohibiting the planting of flowers at gravesites. The family members' claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, lack of authority, and conversion were disposed of prior to trial. After a jury-waived trial on the breach of contract claim, the court entered judgment in favor of defendants. The First Amendment would not be violated by the court exercising jurisdiction over the action because the case could be resolved on neutral principles of contract and property law and would not entangle the court in questions of religious doctrine, policy, or practice. All the easement documents relied on by the family members plainly and unambiguously stated that the burial privileges were subject to the cemetery's rules and defendants were entitled to change those rules. Estoppel did not apply because defendants did not intend to deceive anyone and based on the express notice given to the family members, any reliance based on past practice was unreasonable. The court found the rules to be reasonable and in compliance with Synodal Stat. No. 188 (1957) so it would not substitute its judgment for defendants.</SPAN></P>

As the party was ending a fight erupted near the exit and the injured individual attempted to help the police officer break up the fight when he was struck by an unidentified assailant. The owner argued that any injuries to the injured individual were a result of the negligence of the police officer and therefore the city was liable under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258. The court held that an exemption in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258, &sect; 10(j) applied to defeat the owner's negligence count. The court further determined that the statute was not unconstitutional. As to the breach of contract count the court concluded that there remained a genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of a contract between the city and the owner and therefore summary judgment was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

Code tit. 103, &sect; 403.11(C)(4), which limited the number of books, magazines and newspaper that an inmate might possess in his cell to ten, violated their rights to practice their religious beliefs and that Mass. Regs. Code tit. 103, &sect; 403.11(C)(2), which limited the amount of paper that an inmate might possess to one hundred sheets, violated their rights to free speech under the Massachusetts and United States Constitutions. The court held that the proposed regulations passed constitutional muster under the Turner standards. There was a valid, rational connection between the regulation of the number of books in a cell and the legitimate governmental interest of reduction of possible fire hazards or security problems. The court also found alternative means of exercising the right claimed to be infringed upon because the inmates were allowed to store excess materials in the prison library. Third, the court held that allowing inmates to maintain large numbers of books and papers in their cells could hinder officials' access to those cells.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate challenged a disciplinary action by defendant Massachusetts Department of Correction (DOC), which resulted in his placement in the Departmental Disciplinary Unit (DDU) at a correctional institution. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment as to the inmate's claims that the disciplinary proceeding and subsequent confinement violated state law and his due process and civil rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that he was deprived of an opportunity to present certain witnesses and evidence at his disciplinary hearings. He also contended that his confinement in the DDU violated state law and his due process and civil rights. The court deferred to the hearing officer's determination of the relevancy of the proposed testimonial and documentary evidence. Accordingly, the court declined to make a different choice between two possible factual findings and granted the DOC's cross-motion as to the inmate's claim that the hearings violated his due process rights. Neither party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the inmate's claim that his confinement also violated his due process rights. The parties' affidavits presented a factual question regarding whether the rights of inmates held in the DDU were identical to the rights of those serving sentences in isolation during days 16 to 30. This was material to determining whether Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 127, &sect; 40 applied to the DDU. The inmate's confinement to the DDU did not violate his rights under the ex post facto clause. The inmate civil rights were not violated by the accidental exposure of the inmate to gases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the inmate's motion for partial summary judgment. The DOC's motion for partial summary was allowed as to the inmate's claim that the hearings violated his due process rights. The motion was denied as to the remaining claims.</SPAN></P>

The water district argued that the ALJ erred because the water district's repair to a pond was an emergency under the Dams Safety Act, so it was exempted from the Wetlands Protection Act (Act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The water district owned a pond. The spillway gate that emptied water into the pond became stuck open, and the water district began repairs by lowering the water level. A town conservation commission (commission) informed the water district that lowering the water level was an alteration requiring compliance with the Act, but the water district claimed the repair was exempted. The commission and the DEP both issued enforcement orders charging a violation of the Act, and the DEP assessed a penalty. An ALJ denied the water district's appeal, so the water district appealed to the court. The court affirmed, holding that the water district's rights under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 30A, &sect; 14(7) were not prejudiced by the ALJ's decision. Substantial evidence supported the conclusion that there were no constitutional infirmities in the administrative proceedings or in the application of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21A. Nothing prevented the water district from complying with the requirements of the Act, and the water district's repairs were not emergency actions that exempted it under the Dams Safety Act. The ALJ properly interpreted the Act by finding that the water district willfully violated the Act.</SPAN></P>

The injured person filed an action against defendants, alleging common law negligence and strict liability for violation of the building code, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 143, &sect; 51 (1990).

Although the matter was one of first impression, the court denied the motion. Noting that a complaint should not be dismissed if it could support relief under any theory of law, even a new or extreme theory of liability, the court reviewed case law from the supreme judicial court and held that a cause of action in strict liability based on &sect; 51 might well be recognized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee and his family, who were beneficiaries of a trust, lived in a building that was the trust's property and which the board previously had found to be a rent-controlled lodging house because the trustee had been renting out rooms to individual tenants. The trustee stopped renting out units and occupied the building as a single-family dwelling. The trustee applied to the board for permanent &quot;removal&quot; of the four lodging units from rent control pursuant to Cambridge, Mass., Ordinance 8.44-040(A). When the Cambridge Rent Control Board (board) granted the trustee only a conditional removal permit, the trustee sought judicial review. The court dismissed the trustee's complaint for review and held that there was no taking by the board because there was no present physical occupation, and the trustee was free to exclude others from the property so long as the trustee continued to live in the building. Any economic burden that came from the property's eventual reversion to lodging house status flowed from the trustee's conscious decision to get into the housing market and was not the consequence of a government order wholly divorced from the trustee's own action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court found that the statute and the regulation imposed on liquor licensees a strict duty to insure that illegal activities did not occur on licensed premises. The court determined that it was sufficient to show that the person &quot;running&quot; the premises, as opposed to the licensee itself, had actual or constructive knowledge of the illegality in order to be sanctioned for that conduct. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence for the ABCC to have found that the manager was present at the premises on at least one occasion when a drug sale took place, and knew or should have known of the drug activity. Affirming and dismissing the appeal, the court held that the ABCC's decision was supported by substantial evidence and was free from any error of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parade organizer alleged that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, 92A and 98 did not apply to its St. Patrick's Day parade because it was not a place of public accommodation and that application of the statute violated the parade organizer's right of expressive association. The sexual orientation group alleged that the city had violated its First and Fourteenth amendment rights. The court held the statute prohibiting discrimination for sexual orientation applied to the parade organizer and did not abridge the rights of the parade organizer, and the parade organizer had violated the statute, but that there were no violations of constitutional rights. The evidence established that the parade organizer's sole reason for prohibiting participation in the parade was the group's sexual orientation. Parade participants were so heterogeneous that the parade organizer could not allege expressive association. Provision of police escorts and granting a parade permit were insufficient to substantiate the city's action in the discrimination. The city opposed the parade organizer's discrimination. A city employee's participation in the parade on his own time did not constitute city participation.</SPAN></P>

While on leave he hosted a party, became intoxicated, and accidentally shot his brother in the arm. A hearing was held and the employee was discharged for conduct unbecoming a police officer. The employee challenged the Commission's decision on the grounds that the standard set forth in the police department's regulations was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Alternatively, the employee contended that the Commission's decision was not supported by substantial evidence, and that it was arbitrary and capricious. The court noted that the party appealing an administrative decision bore the burden of demonstrating the decision's invalidity. The court held that the department regulation was not vague. The employee had fair warning of the regulation. The regulation also was not unconstitutionally overbroad. Finally, the court concluded that substantial evidence in the record supported the Commission's conclusion and the decision was not arbitrary or capricious as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. The prisoner's action challenged the constitutionality of new policies and regulations governing inmate property, Christmas packages, discipline, and furloughs, among other subjects. The court granted the commonwealth's motion for summary judgment and denied the prisoner's cross motion for declaratory judgment. The court declared that none of the challenged polices or regulations constituted an ex post facto law or rule in violation of the prisoner's rights under the federal or state constitutions. The court found that the inmate property, visitation, and Christmas package regulations were not penal, retrospective, or onerous because they were administrative provisions that governed the conditions of confinement and did not substantially change the consequences attached to the prisoner's crime. The disciplinary and classification regulations did not apply retrospectively to prisoner conduct. Further, the new prohibitions against granting furloughs to one incarcerated for first degree murder did bar the prisoner from being considered for a commuted sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court granted summary judgment to defendants holding that the program was not coercive of plaintiffs' constitutionally protected rights of privacy and free exercise of religion because students were not forced to participate in the program, or penalized for failure to participate. The same analysis resolved plaintiffs claim under 42 U.S.C.S &sect; 1983 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &sect; 11I.

Reviewing the record, the court granted the prison employees' motion for summary judgment as to the inmate's claim of excessive force. The court held that the use of several employees to restrain the inmate was not excessive, given the inmate's prior history and the lack of any physical injury to the inmate. The court also granted the motion for summary judgment against the administrative segregation of the inmate prior to his hearing. However, the court held that the prison employees had failed to give an adequate reason to support the denial of the inmate's request to call his wife as a witness because there seemed to be no danger to safety.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee sought declaratory and monetary relief, claiming defendant lawmaker unlawfully discharged him. While working as a media assistant, the former employee sustained an injury at work and was unable to lift heavy equipment.

The former employee alleged the lawmaker breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing required in employment at-will contracts, violated his due process rights and his civil rights, and unlawfully interfered with his employment. The lawmaker moved for summary judgment based on the Speech and Debate immunity of the state constitution. The trial court held that the lawmaker was not entitled to Speech and Debate protection because the privilege exempted legislators from liability only for acts performed in a representative capacity. The trial court, however, granted the motion for summary judgment because the former employee had no property or liberty interest in his continued employment, was an at-will employee subject to discharge for virtually any reason, and failed to show a violation of his civil rights or free speech rights.</SPAN></P>

The board affirmed the decision and the licensee sought further review, alleging violation of procedural due process for failure to provide for a pre-revocation hearing and denial of equal protection and substantive due process rights by providing for automatic revocation of his driving privileges based upon another state's action. Both parties filed motions for judgment on the pleadings and the court granted the licensee's motion to the extent that the licensee was entitled to a pre-revocation hearing. The court granted the board's motion, finding that the post-revocation hearing reviewed the issues and substantiated the revocation. The court found that the failure of the licensee to receive notice of the foreign judgment was not a constitutional basis to challenge the statute and that such challenge had to be asserted in the foreign jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The parcel, together with the easement, made the lot a &quot;hammerhead&quot; lot. Plaintiffs applied for a building permit to construct a single-family residence on the lot. They also sought variances from the town's zoning requirements. These requests were denied. On appeal, the court affirmed the board's decision to deny plaintiffs' requested permit and variances. The court ruled that the fact that plaintiffs' parcel lacked sufficient frontage was not a deficiency that justified the issuance of a variance. The court determined that the board's decision to deny the permit was supported by adequate grounds because the board would have had to issue numerous variances simply to allow plaintiffs to apply for a special permit to construct a house. The court concluded that plaintiffs failed to prove that the soil conditions, shape, or topography of their lot were unique to the zoning district in which the lot was situated, thus, they were unable to show that they were entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the charge constituted an assessment, not a tax, under the tri-parte test of the Emerson college precedent because although the public benefited in an attenuated way, the real beneficiary was the corporation, which particularly benefit by the solution to the radioactive waste problem offered by the Commonwealth's scheme. Further, the court determined that the procedure provided within the statutory scheme, codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 30A, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111H, and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231A, was constitutionally sufficient and did not run afoul of the Commerce Clause. Finally, the court held that the corporation's appeal of the assessment was not properly before the administrative magistrate and that the magistrate had therefore lacked jurisdiction over the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that a declaration be entered stating that the assessment was a fee and not an unconstitutional tax, and that the assessment scheme did not violate the Commerce Clause of the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Further, the court ordered that the decision of the administrative magistrate be vacated and the administrative appeal dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that reasonable and consistent interpretations of the Act by the agencies charged with their implementation were entitled to deference. The court found that the burden was on the real estate developers to prove that the charges were taxes rather than fees. The court determined that the charges were fees because they were sufficiently particularized as to justify distribution of the costs among a limited group, the real estate developers, rather than the general public. The court held that the real estate developers were not forced to pay the charges and could have foregone developing the wetlands property. The court denied the real estate developers' motion for summary judgment and granted the motion for summary judgment filed by the DEP and the EOAF.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 127, &sect; 129D&nbsp;unconstitutional. The D.O.C. filed a motion to dismiss the inmate's complaint or, in the alternative, filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate submitted extra-pleading materials. Thus, the court treated the D.O.C.'s motion to dismiss as a summary judgment motion, without notice to the inmate. The court held that the rules and regulations promulgated by the D.O.C. had the force of law. Concerning matters not specifically outlined in the regulations, courts allowed prison administrators considerable discretion in the adoption and implementation of prison policies. Thus, the regulations providing for a 7.5-day cap, which were in effect when the inmate was sentenced, were valid and enforceable in the absence of a specific statute. The 1989 amendment to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 127, &sect; 129D was not an ex post facto law. Because the regulations provided for a 7.5-day cap when the inmate was incarcerated, the inmate could only have expected to have been eligible to earn up to 7.5 days of good time. Moreover, inmates did not have a constitutional right to earned good time credits. Rather, they possessed only a right to participate in designated programs. The court was unable to award the inmate good time credits in excess of the statutory limit based upon an allegation that certain other inmates might have been miscredited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant debtor refused to satisfy a judgment and execution. The Cambridge Division of the District Court Department (Massachusetts) allowed plaintiff creditor's request for an ex parte attachment by trustee process of funds held by defendant bank in the debtor's name, denied a Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 246, &sect; 17 hearing, and allowed the creditor's motion to charge the trustee. The debtor appealed from a summary judgment entered for the creditor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor argued that the trial court denied his constitutional right to due process by refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing, prior to charging the trustee, to determine if the trusteed funds were held absolutely and without any contingency. The court held that the debtor failed to allege any material fact giving rise to a genuine question of fact that would have required a &sect; 17 hearing. The trial court was presented with nothing more than the debtor's unsubstantiated and conclusory allegation that the funds, identified in the trustee's answer as held in the debtor's name, were not held without contingency. The debtor not only did not submit an affidavit or other competent evidence but also failed to advance even an unsworn factual assertion explaining the basis of his allegation. No specific facts were presented that the funds were in any way encumbered or were not the sole property of the debtor. Even if the debtor had presented the requisite factual predicate for an evidentiary hearing, the due process question was moot because the debtor had satisfied the judgment and execution in the original case, the attachment was dissolved, and the funds were returned to the debtor.</SPAN></P>
