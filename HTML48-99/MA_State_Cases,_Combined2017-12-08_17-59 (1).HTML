</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court denied defendant's motions to dismiss the complaints and his requests for rulings of law. Defendant excepted, arguing that Mass. Gen.

The court sustained defendant's exceptions. Although the complaints were phrased in the words of the statute, they did not allege that defendant knew of the obscene nature of the materials involved as required by prior caselaw. Although the scienter element was not a part of the definition of the crime as stated in &sect; 28A, it was an element as interpreted by the courts. Thus, the failure to aver the scienter was fatal and the complaints were insufficient.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers did not allege specific facts in support of these general allegations. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the demurrers were properly sustained because no adequate basis even for declaratory relief was stated by the very limited and somewhat indefinite allegations of fact relied on to show the invalidity of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 490, &sect; 52. Further, the court held that there was an absence of any clear statement of facts showing a threatened immediate expenditure which would entitle the taxpayers to relief under Mass. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant Board of Assessors of Wilmington (Assessors) sought review of a decision from the Appellate Tax Board (Massachusetts), which granted an exemption from real property tax to appellee contractor with respect to certain United States government property used in the performance of its contract with the government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The contractor entered into an agreement with the United States Air Force to construct a radar range. Under a land lease, the contractor was required to pay real estate taxes assessed against the premises. The contractor had three 400 foot towers installed on the property. Each of the towers was braced by guy wires, which were removably attached to concrete anchors. Under the government contract, title to the towers passed to the government upon delivery by the vendor and the government was obligated to reimburse the contractor for its costs. The contractor filed a petition contending the Assessors wrongfully refused to abate tax for 1965, the assessment of which included the towers. The contractor claimed an exemption under Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 59, &sect; 5, pertaining to property owned by the United States. The Board granted the exemption. In reversing on appeal, the court held that: (1) the fact that the contractor was employing government facilities in conducting a private business for profit did not immunize it from a nondiscriminatory state tax of general application; and (2) the town therefore properly assessed a tax on the towers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the Board's decision, which granted the contractor a tax exemption with respect to certain property used in the performance of its federal government contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The doctor was licensed to practice medicine in New York, New Hampshire, the United Kingdom, and Australia. His Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery were awarded to him by the University of Sydney in Australia. The doctor applied for registration as a qualified physician in the Commonwealth but failed to pass a screening examination given to him pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 112, &sect; 2. When &sect; 2 was amended, the doctor applied for registration again; however, the Board denied registration because of the doctor's prior failure of the examination. The trial court affirmed the Board's ruling. On appeal, the court affirmed. That the doctor met the requirement resulting from statutory change in that he held a Standard Certificate did not relieve him from the effect of the proviso regarding prior failure of the screening examination. The language of the proviso had a broad sweep. What he sought was to make an exception of his case on the ground that he met the new statutory requirements, having failed to meet those requirements in effect when he took and failed the screening examination twice. The proviso allowed no exception.</SPAN></P>

The petition for a writ of mandamus sought to restrain the Secretary of the Commonwealth from placing the question set forth in the initiative petition on the ballot in the state election. The court held that Mass. Const. art. 48, which provided for the enactment of a law or laws by popular initiative, did not permit the use of initiative petition for the purpose of calling or holding a convention to amend the state's constitution. The court examined the record of the proceedings of the constitutional convention at which art. 48 was adopted, and found no basis for belief that art. 48 was intended to permit the use of the popular initiative procedure to call a constitutional convention. The court held that art. 48 permitted voters to initiate procedures to make specific constitutional amendments. The court directed that the certificate of certiorari issued by the attorney general was to be quashed and ordered that a writ of mandamus be issued to enjoin the secretary from placing the issue of a constitutional convention on the ballot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The apportionment of state senate seats under &sect; 3 was based on the 1965 census.

The court held that the apportionment of the senate seats in &sect; 3 was unconstitutional because the spread between the district with the highest population and the district with the lowest population was greater than 5.96 percent of the average district population under the apportionment test adopted by the United States Supreme Court. The 10-day limitations period in &sect; 3 did not bar relief because &sect; 3 was unconstitutional.

The trustees contended that any prosecution would contravene various constitutional provisions. The court granted the trustees' request for injunctive relief. Though the play in various respects would be offensive to some persons, it constituted, in some degree, an obscure form of protest protected under the First Amendment. Viewed apart from the specific incidents, it was not lewd and lascivious, whatever other objections there were to it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff city filed a bill in equity in the Superior Court (Massachusetts) against defendant Commissioner of Public Welfare of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231A, seeking a declaratory decree concerning certain liens which the city had acquired under the old age assistance law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 118A, prior to the comprehensive amendment thereof by St. 1967, c. 658, effective July 1, 1968.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city took liens on a number of parcels of real estate owned by recipients of Old Age Assistance and recorded them. The commissioner released a number of such liens upon request of interested persons and for the purpose of clearing record titles of such liens. He did not ask the city to transfer any such liens to the Commonwealth, and did not offer to pay the city any consideration for them. The court held that the Massachusetts Constitution permitted the Legislature to abolish the Old Age Assistance liens without requiring the Commonwealth to compensate the municipalities for the loss of the liens. The court held that the liens were acquired in the administration of the Old Age Assistance Program, and the program as administered by municipalities was a purely governmental function and that all property acquired by them in the discharge of that function was held in their governmental capacity. As such, the liens were subject to legislative control, including the right to abolish them without compensation to the municipalities if it was done for the accomplishment of a public purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court entered a final decree declaring: (a) that the liens acquired by the city which were in effect before July 1, 1968, and on which it had not started judicial enforcement proceedings prior to that date, were abolished; (b) that the city was not entitled to payment from the Commonwealth for the liens which were abolished; and (c) that the treasurer of the city was required to give releases of the liens which were abolished.</SPAN></P>

The court was asked to opine on the constitutionality of the proposed bill in light of a recent decision of the United States Supreme Court. Based upon the language of that decision, the court opined that the proposed legislation was unconstitutional because it infringed upon the fundamental right of interstate movement and therefore violated the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

The court also determined that the proposed amendment did not infringe upon any other constitutional provision in the U.S. Constitution, and therefore the proposed amendment could be lawfully enacted and passed by the general voters of the state.

The railroad was found guilty of violating Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 160, &sect; 151, which prohibited railroads from occupying a street with its cars or engines for more than five minutes at one time. The railroad filed a bill of exceptions, arguing that, because of a speed limit of 15 miles an hour at a crossing over the street, its trains could not traverse the crossing within five minutes and the cost of splitting its trains was prohibitive. The court found that, in a prior opinion, the statute was upheld as valid against a predecessor railroad's contention that it imposed an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. Enforcement of &sect; 151 involved a more direct obstruction of an interstate journey than was the basis of the conviction in the earlier case, but there was not such a substantial differences between the two cases to hold that &sect; 151 was an unconstitutional restriction on interstate commerce.

The court found that there was no need for compliance with art. 89, except for the provision that proposed a limited guarantee of interest payments on certain revenue bonds, as this imposed a special financial burden upon Boston, Massachusetts (Boston). Standing alone, this provision was violative of art. 89. There was no petition by the mayor or city council of Boston approving of the bill, but the court assumed, due to the city's actions, that such would be forthcoming. However, there was no clear statutory language requiring the Authority to protect the public interests in leasing the facilities to private interests and, thus, the court could not advise that the stadium complex and arena would be for a public purpose, though the court recognized that the public purpose would not be destroyed if the Authority made proper leases to privately owned entities for profit.

The order stated that grave doubt existed as to the constitutionality of the bill if enacted into law. The court found that the questions asked by the House were broad in scope and appeared to be directed toward general constitutional rights rather than the specific provisions of the bill. They raised the same basic legal principles. Although the title of the bill showed that the legislature intended to protect the right of privacy of employees, the bill was all inclusive and went far beyond its intent. Under its terms an employer could not operate a closed circuit television system or other monitoring device at any time in a manufacturing establishment or a factory, without the express consent of the employees, and unless the employees had first been notified that such system or device was in operation. The court held that the proposed bill swept too broadly and would, if enacted, be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court, Suffolk (Massachusetts), which convicted him of being in the company of a person, knowing that the person was illegally in possession of heroin, in violation of the second clause of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94, &sect; 231A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A narcotics officer saw defendant lean over the front seat of a car and watch the driver give a man standing on a street corner money in exchange for several white, glassine bags. The officer radioed the information to other officers, one of whom stopped the car and saw five glassine bags containing heroin on the front seat. Defendant contended that the second clause of &sect; 213A was unconstitutional. Affirming, the court held that conviction under that clause required proof that defendant had more than a casual association with another, with knowledge of the latter's illegal possession, unless defendant showed facts constituting justification or excuse. The court found that &sect; 213A, as interpreted, was not unconstitutionally vague, did not violate the right of free association or impose a cruel and unusual punishment, and did not impose a conclusive presumption of guilt. The court concluded that the trial court correctly refused to direct a verdict for defendant because the evidence allowed an inference that he knew the driver had received the heroin, there was no testimony to explain or excuse his presence, and there was sufficient evidence that he was &quot;in the company of&quot; the driver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts propounded questions regarding a pending bill entitled &quot;An Act to allow cities, towns, and districts to send out estimated partial tax bills.&quot; The House of Representatives declared grave doubt as to the constitutionality of the bill if enacted into law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The House questioned the validity of the pending bill under Mass. Const. pt. II, ch. I, &sect; I, art. IV, which granted authority to the General Court to levy proportional and reasonable assessments, rates, and taxes upon all the inhabitants of and persons resident and estates lying within the Commonwealth, and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 10, which had been interpreted to forbid the imposition of disproportionate tax burdens on taxpayers. The court answered that the bill was unconstitutional on both counts. Under the proposed bill, the estimated tax bill was to be one fourth of the tax assessed the preceding year. There was to be no new assessment. In consequence, no attention would be given to changes in valuation during the preceding year. Thus, the destruction of buildings or the erection of new ones prior to January 1 of the current year could not be taken into account. Assessments of less or more than 100 percent of full fair cash value in some cases necessarily would be the basis upon which the taxes would be computed. Thus, the estimated taxes would not be proportional. Moreover, the adjustment procedures were entirely inadequate to make the taxes proportional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court answered the questions of the pending bill's constitutionality in the negative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner filed a writ of error from a decision of the Municipal Court of the Dorchester District of the City of Boston (Massachusetts), which found him guilty on seven complaints of motor vehicle violations and punished him by fines ranging from $ 10 to $ 300. The trial judge found petitioner unable to pay the fines forthwith and ordered him committed to the county jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the trial court found petitioner guilty on the motor vehicle violations and assessed fines, it concluded that he was unable to pay and ordered him committed to the county jail without suspending the fines. Petitioner sought a writ of error on the ground that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 279, &sect; 1, which required the suspension of fines under certain circumstances, was not satisfied by the trial court's bare finding that petitioner was unable to pay the fine forthwith, and that a hearing was required. Alternatively, he argued that if ch. 279, &sect; 1 did permit such confinement, it was unconstitutional. The court noted that petitioner had been in default on five of the seven counts of motor vehicle violations for some time and was at the time of trial also in default in district court on other motor vehicle violations. The court concluded that even assuming that more than a bare finding of inability to pay was required before petitioner could be incarcerated for nonpayment of a fine, the court was satisfied that petitioner's default justified the trial judge's refusal to suspend the sentences, and the court remanded for appropriate correction of the orders of commitment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court remanded the case for appropriate correction of the orders of commitment, and ordered that if such correction was made within 30 days after rescript, the judgments would be affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, the Insurance Rating Board (Board), the Mutual Insurance Rating Bureau (Bureau) and several insurance companies, asked the court to determine whether defendant Commissioner of Insurance (Commissioner) had authority to freeze certain automobile insurance rates. The proceedings were reserved without decision upon the pleadings and a statement of agreed facts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commissioner contended that the rate freeze provision of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 643, &sect; 2A (1968) applied to automobile property damage liability insurance. He argued that the Legislature, when it used the words &quot;policies or bonds&quot; as opposed to &quot;coverage,&quot; intended the words &quot;policies or bonds&quot; to include all coverages contained in policies or bonds which contained compulsory bodily injury liability coverage, and not just the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage. The court held that the words must have been limited to the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 34A. The Board and the Bureau contended that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175A, &sect; 113C did not apply to everyone who purchased automobile property damage liability coverage. The court held that the Legislature intended the provisions of &sect; 113C to apply to all policies and bonds containing the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage. The court held that the Legislature intended the entire procedure established in the first paragraph of &sect; 113B to apply to &sect; 113C.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Decrees were entered ordering the Commissioner to accept the filings tendered by the Board and the Bureau applicable to automobile property damage liability coverage in excess of the $ 5,000 amount required by statute and to automobile property damage liability coverage offered independent of the compulsory bodily injury liability coverage, and finding that the statutory rate freeze provisions applied only to compulsory bodily injury coverage.</SPAN></P>

Rather, the physician challenged the validity of &sect; 19. The Board revoked the physician's registration and the physician challenged that decision in the trial court. The trial court affirmed the Board's decision and the physician appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the physician's broad contention that the Act was void for vagueness lacked support in precedent. The court noted that the physician could lawfully perform an abortion if he acted in good faith and if he honestly believed that the abortion was necessary to preserve the woman's life or health. Because the physician did not prove an existence of any peril to the woman or his good faith in performing the abortion, he did not have standing to raise a question concerning whether his judgment corresponded with the average judgment of doctors in the community in which he practiced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The action of contract, when entered, was not subject to dismissal for failure to prosecute under Rule 43A of the Rules of the Municipal Court of the City of Boston for Civil Actions for 14 years. Rule 43A was amended while the hospital's action was pending, to allow dismissal for failure to prosecute after six years. The hospital received no personal notice that the rule was amended. It was the usual practice of the Clerk of the Municipal Court to post any change in the court's rules in the clerk's office. It was not stated that the clerk failed to post the change to Rule 43a. The court noted that Superior Court Rule 85, provided that the clerk of the court was required to give notice to every party when cases are marked inactive, and were started on the way to be eligible for dismissal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was invited to lecture on certain issues and provided information on and displays of certain products used for the prevention of conception. Following the lecture, defendant invited audience members to step forward and take with them any of the displayed products. This resulted in indictments for violations of &sect; 21, which prevented the giving away, selling, or exhibiting of certain birth control methods. The trial court found defendant guilty as charged and defendant, on appeal, challenged &sect; 21 and claimed the statute amounted to an unlawful restraint on his freedom of speech. As to the exhibiting of birth control products, the court found that activity protected as free speech and struck &sect; 21 as applied to exhibiting such products. As to the giving away or selling of such products, however, the court found &sect; 21 was an exercise of the commonwealth's legitimate interest in preventing the distribution of articles which may have had undesirable, if not dangerous, physical consequences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The amended by-law applied to all the land in the town, permitting any lot not then used for access to be so used with the consent of the board of appeals. The first part of &sect; II(10) expressly changed the zoning classification of residential parcels currently used for access roads so as to permit such use. That part of the amendment did not apply to the homeowners' land. The trial court, inter alia, found that the by-law was invalid. On appeal, the court held that Mass. Gen.

The court held that it was error to rule invalid the provision for the use of residentially zoned land for access to other zones with the approval of the board of appeals. There was unequal treatment of residential areas near parcels in illegal use before the amendment, on the one hand, and areas not near such parcels, on the other. The use for industrial access to the extent found by the trial court of strips of residentially zoned land on both sides of the homeowners' property was unreasonable as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held erroneous the ruling that the amendment involved illegal delegation of power to the board of appeals; the court affirmed the ruling that in effect held that no aspect of accessory use to a permitted use was involved; the court affirmed the ruling that the amendment was arbitrary and discriminatory in its effect on the homeowners' land; and the court affirmed the decision that the amendment was invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's property was zoned &quot;residence and rural district.&quot; Farms were permitted as well as the raising of domestic or &quot;other animals.&quot; At the time of the alleged violation, defendant was the holder of a mink ranch certificate issued by the Massachusetts Department of Agriculture under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 105A. Defendant's mink had been propagated in captivity for more than two generations and were &quot;domesticated mink&quot; as defined in the state statute. The court ruled that defendant violated the ordinance because mink were not included in the meaning of &quot;other animals.&quot; The court explained that the ordinance prohibited the raising of animals that were not accustomed to living in close proximity to people. The court pointed out that if the term was not so restricted, land on which lions, for example, were raised would be classified as a farm. The court thought that such an interpretation was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court overruled defendant's exceptions, finding that the officer was also warranted in frisking defendant and seizing a screwdriver that was in his possession, even if the screwdriver was not classified as a weapon. A police officer could conduct a search for weapons in circumstances that warranted a reasonable belief that his safety or that of others was in danger, and the officer had reasonable grounds to be suspicious of defendant. The contents of the department store bag that defendant voluntarily revealed to the officer were a sales slip dated three days before defendant said he purchased the items and clothing that was not his size.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Narcotic Drugs Law (Act) penalized possession, possession with intent to sell, or being present where marijuana was kept. Defendants argued that the Act violated Mass. Const. Part II, ch. 1, &sect; 1, art. 4; and Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 1, as there was no evidence marihuana endangered the public. The court noted expert testimony that marihuana caused hallucinations, psychotic breaks, and use of more dangerous drugs. Absence of absolute proof of the harm did not prevent the state from proscribing its use. The fact that certain of the drugs listed in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94, &sect; 197 as amended 196 Mass. Acts 71, &sect;&sect; 1,2 were more dangerous than some not listed did not render the classification unreasonable. The Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, only required reasonable classification. The harmful effects of alcohol, by example, were better known than those of marijuana, LSD, or heroin. The punishments provided for violation of the Act was not cruel and excessive, Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 26; U.S. Const. amend. VIII. No mandatory minimum existed for any of the statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court answered in the affirmative the trial court's reported question.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The prisoner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus contending that the department had erred in computing his parole eligibility date for his subsequent offense. The prisoner had been convicted for the crime of braking and entering in the nighttime and larceny while he had been on parole for a prior conviction for robbery. Defendant was sentenced to three to five years for the subsequent crime and under amended Mass, Gen.

The court ruled that &sect; 133 did not affect the prisoner's sentence for his prior conviction of robbery. Section 133 related only to the parole eligibility date for sentences imposed after the statute became effective.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A city took property by eminent domain. The Massachusetts House of Representatives proposed a bill to repay the property owners. The bill was presented to the Senate, and the Senate adopted an order in which it posed a question to the Massachusetts Supreme Court justices regarding the constitutionality of the legislation. The court held that that the proposed legislation did not unconstitutionally violate either the Fourteenth Amendment or the Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights. arts. VI, VII, or X. The court opined that since the bill would confer on a named individual, it was not unconstitutional provided that a legitimate public good was derived from the bill. The court noted that the city incurred a legal obligation to the property owners pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws. c. 79, &sect; 6. The court further found that even though this moral obligation was only voluntary, the property owners were entitled to the highest protection of the law since their property was taken by eminent domain.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of possession of burglarious tools with intent to use them, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that although the trial court did not inquire of the new trial attorney who had been engaged the day before the trial if he was ready and reasonably prepared to try the case, this was inadequate ground for postconviction relief. Letting the case go to trial after the new attorney's appearance, without a request by him for more time, was not a denial by the trial court of time for preparation. Defendant's conduct at the fur store suggested that probable cause for the arrest might have been shown had the issue been properly raised and fully tried, and the court did not view the search within 15 minutes of the arrest as the loss of such a fundamental constitutional right that postconviction relief should have been granted. No patently unreasonable police conduct was shown because the officers had ground to suspect that they had interrupted a burglary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was indicted for being present where a narcotic drug was illegally kept and deposited. The defendant moved for dismissal of the indictment. The trial court denied both this motion and a motion for a directed verdict of not guilty. The court overruled defendant's exceptions to the denials. In view of the severe penalty imposed for violations of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94, &sect; 213A, the court declined to conclude that knowledge was not required for a conviction under the first clause of the statute, in the absence of clear legislative language that so stated. The court thus interpreted the first clause of &sect; 213A as requiring for a conviction proof that the accused was present where he knew a narcotic drug was illegally kept or deposited. There was ample evidence from which the jury could find a violation of &sect; 213A as the court interpreted it. The section was not invalidly vague on its face. There were no exceptions to the judge's charge or to any failure to give requested instructions. The jury reasonably could infer, from defendant's presence at a table on which were found plainly visible marijuana and a half-smoked marijuana cigarette, that he knew about these items.</SPAN></P>

The state officials challenged the voter's standing to sue and denied that the voter's constitutional rights had been violated. The court ruled that the voter had standing to bring the action as he was a voter in a district having a greater population per representative than the statewide norm, but the court ultimately dismissed the voter's petition. The court found that the districting of the islands followed existing political subdivision lines, aimed to restrict the possibility of partisan gerrymandering and gave effect to the county role in the governmental system of the Commonwealth. The court ruled that these reasons were permissible grounds for deviation from a strict mathematical apportionment by population.

Further, petitioner failed to show that the procedure was defective as applied to him. Second, arguments regarding the admission of hearsay evidence failed because no exception was made at trial. Third, the application of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A did not deprive petitioner of the equal protection of the laws.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted on a charge of a gaming violation. He appealed to the superior court and renewed his motion that was made in the district court to suppress evidence. The superior court denied the motion and defendant filed exceptions. On appeal, the court stated that on a motion to suppress, the burden of establishing that evidence was illegally obtained was on the moving party. The court held that defendant had not sustained that burden. The court stated that because defendant failed to make the necessary showing, the regularity of the issuance of the warrant could be presumed. Defendant also contended that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 271, &sect; 23, under which the warrant was issued, was unconstitutional in that it required only that an applicant was to swear that he suspected or had probable cause to suspect violations of law. The court held that in reviewing the issuance of a warrant under Mass. Gen. Law Ch. 271, &sect; 23, the primary inquiry was whether satisfactory evidence of probable cause was shown to the issuing authority. The court held that the warrant was validly issued in the language of the statute. Therefore, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgments against defendant. The court concluded that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress items that were seized from his bag on the ground that an allegedly illegal wiretap tainted the evidence. The court held that the line between the alleged illegality and the discovery of the evidence had become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint because the seizure was incident to a lawful arrest. The court found that there was no need to warn defendant of his constitutional rights because there was no custodial interrogation and that he was not entitled to counsel at a rendition hearing in another state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The senate's order to the court recited the pendency before the legislature of a bill, S. 869, that if and when enacted, would have been referred to as the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Educational Facilities Authority Act. The bill created an authority composed of seven members to be appointed by the governor. The authority would have been a body politic, and the purpose of the authority would have been to assist institutions for higher education in the construction, financing, and refinancing of projects. The senate's questions were motivated by doubts about the constitutionality of the bill. The court answered in the negative to all the questions, except for part of the sixth question in which the court answered in the affirmative. The court found that the bill effectively guarded public funds from expenditures in violation of Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights amend. art. 46. The court found that the authority the bill created would have received funds to implement the general secular public purpose without appropriation of public funds or pledge of public credits because there was no grant or appropriation of public property or loan of public credit contained in the bill.</SPAN></P>

Defendants moved to dismiss the indictments and sought to challenge the jury array, but the motions were denied.

They also argued that the indictments were unconstitutional because the grand jury that returned the indictments deliberately and consistently excluded Puerto Ricans. The court affirmed, holding that there was no evidence of systematic disqualification of Puerto Ricans for jury duty or of failure to call any who may have so qualified. The voting list in the city was prepared from the list of registered voters. Persons eligible to vote were required, among other things, to fill out a questionnaire and to read five lines of the Constitution of the Commonwealth in English.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">There were two major issues involved in the bill.

The court did not provide an opinion on the first issue because it could not determine how the United States Supreme Court would answer the question in resolving an Equal Protection Clause challenge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The national bank claimed that national banks were exempt from the state sales and use taxes. No ruling was received pursuant to the request.

The issue thus presented for the court's determination was whether the sales and use tax could have been applied to purchases made by the bank and other national banks doing business in the commonwealth. The court held that the tax did apply and that national banks were not exempt from such taxes. At best, the bank was a creature of the United States and not entitled to an exemption as an &quot;agency&quot; of the United States. No contention could be made that the bank functioned as &quot;an arm of the government.&quot; The national bank enjoyed the benefits of state and local services, the protection of the laws of the state, access to its courts, and the patronage of its citizens.</SPAN></P>

Acts 711 was unconstitutional. The Worcester Superior Court (Massachusetts) ordered the entry of an interlocutory decree confirming the report of the master to whom the case was referred.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The committee purported to take by eminent domain 122 acres of land in the town for school purposes, which included the landowners' property.

Acts 711 contained a description of 31.91 acres of the landowners' and authorized and directed the committee to convey by a deed, without covenants to the landowners whatever right, title, and interest to that land that the committee acquired from the landowners under the order of taking. The committee contended that the act was unconstitutional because, in conferring special and private privilege, it was not a wholesome and reasonable law with the meaning of Mass. Const. pt. II, ch. 1, &sect; 1, art. 4. In affirming, the court held that a statute that conferred a benefit on a named individual was not unconstitutional, provided that a legitimate public good was to be derived from such a statute. 1964 Mass. Acts 711 did not suspend the operation of a provision of the General Laws.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff Massachusetts Port Authority (MPA) sought declaratory relief from the Massachusetts Superior Court, which reported without decision, against defendants, members of the state retirement board, regarding MPA obligations for retirement, disability, and death benefits of persons that became employees when the MPA took over control of bridge properties under &sect; 22 of an enabling act, as amended by Mass. Stat. ch. 599, &sect; 10 (1958).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">MPA employees were paid retirement allowances for age or ordinary disability, allowances or death benefits for employment-related accidents, and special veteran benefits under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &sect;&sect; 56-60. All except those with accident-related benefits were former employees of the bridge authority. The court found that the MPA had to bear the whole burden of benefits based upon accidental disability and the burden of all retirement allowances except that portion attributable to creditable service in another governmental unit that was part of the state retirement system. Because the bridge authority was not a part of the state retirement system, the court viewed &sect; 22 of the enabling act as requiring the MPA to assume the retirement liabilities based on the transferred employees' service with the bridge authority. That also applied to liabilities of the veterans. Further, under &sect; 22, the State could not be apportioned any part of the burden for employment-related disability. The legislative alterations in the arrangements by which the MPA paid pensions were properly within the police power and did not constitute an impairment of the obligation of MPA bond contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court remanded for the entry of a final decree declaring that the MPA was to reimburse the State for retirement, disability, and employment-related disability allowances for creditable service as a MPA or bridge authority employee and that the State was to reimburse the MPA for that portion expended by MPA for retirement benefits in which the period of creditable service was from another state entity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The property owners removed sand and gravel from the property and trucks transported away the sand and gravel. The town subsequently adopted a law that regulated the removal of earth materials. The owners thereafter applied to the town board for a permit to remove the sand and gravel from their property, and the board denied the permit but issued the owners a temporary permit so that they could wind up the operations. The owners continued to remove the sand and gravel after the temporary permit expired and did not restore their property as the permit directed. The town brought a bill in equity seeking to enjoin the owners and the trial court granted the relief. The owners appealed and the court reversed. The court noted that the only aspect of the operations that was found objectionable by the board was the truck traffic created over a roadway during the removal of the sand and gravel. The court held that the enabling statute under which the board acted, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40, &sect; 21(17), was not so broad as to permit the regulation of traffic in the manner attempted by the board. The court also noted that the prior decree adjudging the owners in contempt was proper when issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs were a group of corporations that objected to the amount of workers' compensation premiums that were allocated among them based upon experience ratings. Plaintiffs sought judicial review of their complaints and sought to bypass the administrative process, which was objected to by defendants. The underlying court held for plaintiffs and defendants appealed. On review, the court noted that defendants showed proof that plaintiffs failed to comply with the Workmen's Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau (the Bureau). The court held that the trial court's holding that there was substantial compliance was in error as the noncompliance was critical. However, the applicable statutes allowed plaintiffs to seek declaratory relief beyond the traditional administrative redress. Further, the nature of the relationship of plaintiffs to their related corporate entities was such that there was no inequity caused by defendant's requirements. Accordingly, the decision was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decision was reversed because the applicable rule regarding the charges based upon defendant's experience rating plan was not &quot;unfairly discriminatory&quot; and did not lead to &quot;excessive&quot; rates.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that there was no limit upon the number that could be present. The court determined that: (1) the prosecutor had discretion as to the use of assistants and could have present from time to time such reasonable number as he deemed appropriate; and (2) in presenting cases to the grand jury, the prosecutor and his assistants must scrupulously refrain from words or conduct that would invade the province of the grand jury or tend to induce action other than that which the jurors in their uninfluenced judgment deemed warranted on the evidence fairly presented before them.

The court further found that although the eavesdropping statute was not a paragon of clarity and a careful reading of it was required to ascertain what could or could not be done, it was not so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.</SPAN></P>

Acts ch. 544, &sect; 14 (as amended by 1949 Mass. Acts ch. 572, &sect; 6) expressly exempted all property of the Authority.</SPAN></P>

The lessee occupied and used the property solely as a retail store under a written lease. The assessors assessed a tax on the property to the lessee for 1962 and to the authority for 1963. The assessors contended that the exemption in &sect; 14 only applied to the Authority and that to construe &sect; 14 as explicitly exempting both the Authority and its lessee from taxation violated Mass. Const. pt. II, ch. 1, &sect; 1, art. 4, which required that taxes on property be proportional and reasonable. Affirming the Board's decisions, the court held that 1947 Mass. Acts ch. 544, &sect; 14 (as amended by 1949 Mass. Acts ch. 572, &sect; 6) allowed a lessee of the Authority a tax exemption similar to that enjoyed by the Authority because the 1949 amendment extended the exemption to encompass all the Authority's property, whether or not it was used in the transit system, and was one of several steps taken by the legislature to alleviate the Authority's financial burden. The court was unable to say that the exemption did not primarily benefit the public and found that the fact that it placed one business in a favored position did not make it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that absent the scienter requirement, booksellers, unable to familiarize themselves with all the material on their shelves, would tend to restrict sales to minors to the relatively few books of which they had some knowledge of the contents or character. The court concluded that because proof of scienter was lacking the trial judge erred in denying defendant's motion for a not guilty finding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The house of representatives' order to the court recited the pendency before the legislature of a bill, House No. 3696, which was entitled &quot;An Act providing for a Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency.&quot; The bill resembled the final report of the special commission on low-income housing. The house of representatives' questions were motivated by doubts about the constitutionality of the bill. The first question was whether the granting by the agency established by the bill of low interest loans to private individuals, associations, or corporations for the purpose of financing the building or rehabilitation of housing designed and planned to be available at low and moderate rentals for low and moderate income families constituted a public purpose for which money raised by taxation could have been expended as provided in the bill. The court answered in the negative to the first question and refrained from answering the remainder of the questions. The court found that so far as the purpose of the bill was to provide housing for families of moderate income, the bill had not appeared to be confined to a public purpose. The court found that bill had to be substantially revised.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 40, &sect; 53. The bill of complaint questioned the validity of the appointment of the city manager, and sought to prevent his expending money to pay his compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The fundamental issue before the court was whether the taxpayers had a remedy in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40, &sect; 53. Defendants contended that the suit was really for the purpose of trying the city manager's title to office. The taxpayers denied the assertion and insisted that the suit was to prevent the incurring of illegal expenditures. The court found that the relief sought was premised upon the city manager's ineligibility for office due to a supposed violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 43, &sect; 103, in that he was unable to receive a salary because of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &sect; 91, in that he was receiving a retirement allowance from the city. The court held that this was actually an impermissible attack upon the manager's title to his office and that such title could not be brought under a collateral attack against illegal expenditures.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws ch. 160, &sect; 151.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The railroad was convicted of obstructing and occupying a public way with its railroad cars for over seven minutes when its railroad cars traversed a public street. The railroad contended that (1) &sect; 151, was not applicable to moving trains, and (2) if it was applicable to moving trains, &sect; 151 was unconstitutional as contravening the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8. The court disagreed. The court found that the statute was intended to apply to moving trains as well as stationary ones. There was no phraseology that limited its application, and there was nothing convincing in the legislative history, which suggested that the legislature at any time had in mind any exception by implication. In addition, the statute was not in contravention of the Commerce Clause because it was not directed at interstate commerce. Its purpose was the safety of the public and convenient use of its highways. Also, there was nothing to show that such a train could not reasonably be moved over the crossing in five minutes. In short, there was presented a local problem without effect on national or interstate uniformity and in a field where uniformity was not necessary or desirable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed a decree from the Superior Court, Suffolk (Massachusetts), which dismissed the taxpayers' petition to enjoin defendants, a commission and others, from building a track and field facility for high school meets on land acquired by a board of park commissioners for park purposes. The court declared that 1964 Mass. Acts ch. 441, which authorized and directed construction of the athletic plant, was a valid enactment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1899 the legislature gave the board control of lands owned by a city and provided for the taking of land by eminent domain for &quot;park purposes.&quot; By 1959 Mass. Acts ch. 240, the legislature authorized the board to convey part of the land to the commission for the development of recreational centers. At that time there were no plans to build a track facility. The taxpayers contended that only the facilities shown on the 1959 plan could be erected and that ch. 240 and 1964 Mass. Acts ch. 441 were unconstitutional. Affirming the decree, the court held that the legislature had the power to sell, lease, or alter the use of park lands. The court ruled that the representation of several proposed facilities on the 1959 plan did not show an intent to prohibit the construction of other facilities. The court found that the legislature could delegate the determination of how much land was needed to develop a reasonably described recreational facility, like the athletic plant described in ch. 441, and could authorize the leasing of the facility for private use during periods when it could not be used for its public purpose by area schools in connection with their physical-education programs.</SPAN></P>

The Senate adopted the bill on June 8, 1965. They submitted two questions to the court concerning the proposed statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The bill provided for payments by the city for the retirement of certain alcoholic beverage licenses issued under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 138, &sect;&sect; 12, 15 in a certain city. The Senate found that the numbers of licensed establishments continued to be above the allowable quotas. The problem of excessive numbers of licensed establishments was compounded by the fact the city was undergoing a renewal process, and many of the licensed establishments had been displaced by eminent domain takings. The questions posed by the Senate were: (1) would the payments to licensees as provided in the bill be for a public purpose; and (2) would the bill be constitutional if enacted into law? The court noted that the Legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had a right to appropriate as suggested when it fairly reached the conclusion that the public good would be served by payments to the licensees. The court noted the bill sought to cut down the breeding of nuisances and near nuisances. The court construed question two as supplementary to question one. The court answered yes to question two, holding the unequal payments to licensees over a period of years would not be discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers alleged that amounts necessary to support the city's schools in 1962 were not included in the annual budget, and they asked that the deficiency be determined and that the City be ordered to provide that amount, plus a sum equal to 25 percent of it. The 1962 school committee reduced the amount in the 1961 committee's estimate, and the mayor put the reduced amount in the annual budget. The court rejected the taxpayers' contention that the 1962 committee had no authority to alter the estimate of expenditures made by the 1961 committee, which affected salary appropriations. The court opined that the estimated budget only needed to be seasonably submitted with reference to the date on which the budget was presented to the city council, and the 1962 committee was not bound by the vote of the 1961 committee. The court concluded that the 1962 committee had authority to establish new salary schedules, reducing the amount the City had to appropriate under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71, &sect; 34. The court opined that even if the committee's motivation was to act in the interest of the City's well-being, it did not establish that the committee did not consider the welfare of the schools.</SPAN></P>

Some time thereafter the child's paternal grandmother sought a decree changing custody, and the Massachusetts probate court granted her petition. The mother then filed a petition to revoke the decree, and the grandmother sought permanent custody. The probate court ruled in favor of the grandmother. On appeal, the court held that: 1) the welfare of the child required that the grandmother retain custody, especially in view of the mother's failure to avail herself of opportunities to see the child; 2) reports of the guardian ad litem were properly considered; 3) the probate court had jurisdiction to enter the custody decree because the child was an inhabitant of the commonwealth, in accordance with Mass.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The property owner argued that the government's enforcement of Mass. Gen.

The court reversed the order and remanded the case, concluding that it was necessary to preserve and protect marine fisheries, that &sect; 27A authorized the government to prohibit filling in the marshes, and that &sect; 27A was valid. The court, however, opined that further findings were necessary in order to have determined whether the enforcement of &sect; 27A was in invalid taking of the property owner's property that entitled him to just compensation. The court explained that notwithstanding the meritorious character of the regulation, it was possible that there had been such a deprivation of the practical uses of the property owner's property as to have been the equivalent of a taking without compensation. The court noted that while it was permissible to regulate property to a certain extent, if regulation went too far it was a taking.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court, Suffolk (Massachusetts), found that defendant was a sexually dangerous person, and ordered him committed to the treatment center for an indeterminate period of from one day to life under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued on appeal from the commitment order due to the trial court's finding that defendant was a sexually dangerous person that since he was not serving sentences for offences of a sexual nature, had no record of conviction for sexual offences, and there was no evidence of any sexual misbehavior while in prison, he could not be committed as a sexually dangerous person. Contrary to defendant's claim, the court found that it was not necessary to read such requirements into ch. 123A, &sect; 6 in order to accord defendant due process of law. The court noted that the trial court followed the proper procedure. Under the proper procedure, the rights of prisoners were carefully protected. The court further found that the testifying psychiatrist's definition of a sexually dangerous person was not precisely in accord with the definition set forth in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, &sect; 1; however, the court held that the ultimate decision as to whether defendant was a sexually dangerous person was for the trial court to determine on all the evidence. The court concluded that the findings of the trial court were amply warranted on the evidence, and that defendant's requests were rightly refused.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner taxpayers challenged an order from the Superior Court, Suffolk (Massachusetts), which dismissed a petition in favor of respondent Commonwealth. Another case consolidated with the first, seeking mandamus against the initiative leading to enactment of 1964 Mass. Acts ch. 740, &quot;An Act repealing the statutory powers of the governor's council which interfere with the efficient operation of the executive department of the Commonwealth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The first case was brought against the Secretary of the Commonwealth seeking an order to refrain from submitting 1964 Mass. Acts ch. 740 to the voters. The second case was brought against the Treasurer, the Receiver General, and the Secretary, seeking an order commanding them to refrain from taking action or paying funds under ch. 740. The court noted that the term &quot;description&quot; was replaced with &quot;fair, concise summary&quot; because &quot;description&quot; had been interpreted as implying a very substantial degree of detail and had resulted in very long and cumbersome statements of proposed laws. The court observed that the change to &quot;fair, concise summary&quot; was to remedy that difficulty and had to be given effect to that end. The court opined that requiring a description to be determined by the Attorney General was intended to insure that signers of an initiative or referendum understood the law they proposed and that the voters understood the law on which they were voting. The court concluded that the Attorney General's summary was fair and concise and not open to the petitioners' complaints, and that the taxpayers had no standing to raise questions where their rights were not impaired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's order in the first case and dismissed the second case. Mandamus was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff businesses appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court (Massachusetts), which sustained demurrers of defendants, a city, the city council, the city manager, a redevelopment authority, the attorney general, and the deputy commission of the division of urban and industrial renewal, to the businesses' action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief regarding urban renewal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The businesses sought a declaratory decree that their industrial area did not constitute a valid subject for an urban renewal project under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 121. The trial court sustained demurrers to the bill in equity and reported the case for determination on the interlocutory decree. Affirming, the court found that no determination to proceed by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 121, &sect; 26P had been made, and that the most that had occurred was that the housing authority adopted a resolution that the area was appropriate for an urban renewal project and applied for Federal funds to make surveys and plans in connection with the project. The court held that derogatory allegations in the bill did not enable the present attempted intrusion into the orderly consideration of the subject to be maintained. The court found that any other claimed objections or damage did not raise any controversy because they were wholly speculative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

There was no reasonable likelihood that under ch. 161A public funds would be paid to a private company whose particular operations did not greatly serve the public need, so that in the particular instance the private advantage was to be principally served. The court held that the commonwealth in pledging its credit for the purpose of making payments to a limited class of private companies under the statutory scheme was not in contravention of Mass. Const. art. 62, &sect; 1; therefore no two-thirds vote was required. Further, the court found the provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 161A, &sect; 28, which authorized contract assistance by the commonwealth to the transit authority, whereby a portion of the net cost of service were paid by the commonwealth and not assessed upon the cities and towns, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The second issue concerned respondent's writ of prohibition to prevent the court from considering another petition for review of respondent's denial of a drug store permit. The matter was reserved. In both cases, respondent challenged the court's jurisdiction to review respondent's administrative decisions. The court found that respondent's hearings concerning issuance of drug store permits were adjudicatory, and respondent's discretion to deny a permit could only be exercised after fair investigation, with such a notice, hearing and opportunity to answer for the applicant as would constitute due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The commissioner sought to enjoin the manufacturer from selling the product in Massachusetts because it violated Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94, &sect; 187, which prohibited the sale of misbranded products. The commissioner argued that consumers might confuse the manufacturer's product with real cream. The manufacturer sought a declaratory decree regarding the applicability of &sect; 187 to its product. The court held that &sect; 187 as applied to the product as it was being sold was unconstitutional under the Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights arts. 1, 10, and 12. The court found that the product was an imitation within &sect; 187 because it resembled cream, was used like cream, and was not differentiated from cream in the mind of the consumer. However, the court found that there was no rational basis to think that consumers would confuse the product with cream. The court held that the prohibition of the product from retail sale in Massachusetts was not a valid exercise of police power because the prohibition did not bear a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, or some other phase of the general welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff Commissioner of the Metropolitan District Commission filed an action for declaratory relief against defendants, Director of Civil Service and a patrolman applicant, seeking a determination whether the applicant, as a disabled veteran, was entitled to appointment under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &sect; 23 (1954), after he had pled guilty to armed robbery, but received a full pardon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commissioner had refused to appoint the applicant following certification of eligibility on a civil service list. The court, noting that the case was one of first impression in Massachusetts, concluded that the full pardon of the applicant removed a bar of absolute ineligibility under Mass Gen. Laws ch. 42, &sect; 96A (1938), which prevented appointment of a felon as a patrolman. Nevertheless, the court found that under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 31, &sect; 23 (1954), the applicant was not entitled to automatic appointment based on a disabled veteran preference. The court held that the Commissioner could refuse to appoint the applicant because of conduct underlying his conviction. The court concluded it was obviously inappropriate to appoint as a police officer one previously convicted of felony, but later pardoned for grounds other than his innocence. Thus, the court reversed a decree in favor of the applicant and declared that under &sect; 23, the Commission had the duty and broad discretion to refuse to appoint a person to be a patrolman if he was of bad character, a poor moral risk, or an unsuitable appointee by reason of his pardoned conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the grant of the job application and declared that the Commissioner had a duty to deny the position of patrolman to the applicant if he did not meet the statutory criteria.</SPAN></P>

Respondents contended the validity of the summonses issued by the commission to respondents. The summonses required attendance before the commission and required for the production of certain volumes of the minutes of the meetings of the authority. The custodian of the minute books appeared before the commission without the records and declined to answer certain questions. An attorney for the authority wrote the commission that the persons summoned declined to appear because the summonses were too broad and general, failed to state any matter under examination with adequate specificity, and were issued in aid of unconstitutional practices and programs of the commission. The commission then brought a petition for enforcement of process and respondents brought a counterclaim. The court ordered the county court to issue an order requiring the attendance of respondents before the commission and the production of the requested documents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Intervenor home owners appealed the entry of declaratory relief by the Superior Court (Massachusetts), which required defendants town and building commissioner to issue plaintiff religious order a permit for a college building. In a relating bill in equity, the town board of appeals denied the order's variance application. The superior court reversed under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A, &sect; 21 but with a reservation, and the religious order appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The religious order operated a number of educational institutions and applied for a permit to erect a three-story building. On review, the court found that the superior court lacked jurisdiction to hear the suit for declaratory relief, but in view of the public interest, the court expressed its views on the substantive issues. The court found that the land owned by the order was exempt from the operation of the town's zoning by-law, which would have held the proposed building to the same dimensional requirements as were imposed on detached single family dwellings. The by-law would have &quot;limited the use&quot; of the land and application was therefore invalid under ch. 40A, &sect; 2. The court found that it was not irrational for the legislature to determine that educational and religious institutions were exempted from the application of zoning laws. It was not an establishment of religion merely to exempt such institutions from some aspect of governmental supervision or restriction. In any event, a sufficient answer to the argument under the establishment clause was that the bill for declaratory relief concerned an educational use rather than a religious use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that the land was exempt from the zoning by-law, reversed the decision as to the board of appeals, and ordered a final decree is to be entered stating that the decision of the board did not exceed its authority and that no modification of its decision was required. In the light of the lack of jurisdiction, the final decree entered in the superior court in the suit for declaratory relief was reversed and the bill dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Three criminal cases were begun by complaints in a district court. Each complaint charged that the taxi driver solicited the carriage of a passenger for hire without being licensed as a hackney carriage driver and that the taxi cab was not licensed as a hackney carriage by the police commissioner. The taxi cab drivers were found guilty in each case and they appealed to the superior court. No question of fact being involved, the judge directed a verdict of guilty in each case and fines were imposed. The cases were before the court on a consolidated bill of exceptions. The taxi drivers had excepted to the denial of their motions to quash on the ground that the complaints did not charge an offense. The court held that the offense was defined with sufficient definiteness. The court found nothing to indicate that the application of 1963 Mass. Acts 386, would impede the operation of the airport in any way. The court determined that the airport, which was within the city limits, was subject to 1963 Mass. Acts 386.</SPAN></P>

The order referred to House Bill No. 1482, which was pending before the House and had been the subject of a prior advisory opinion. The bill was entitled: An Act appropriating a sum of money to be paid to certain political parties for the purpose of defraying part of the cost of the political campaign of such parties in the next state election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The legislators posed two questions, asking whether appropriating public funds for use by the state committees of political parties was constitutional and whether appropriating and disbursing tax money for such a use was for a public purpose. The court remarked that it lacked jurisdiction under Mass. Const. pt. 2, ch. III, art. II, to answer an abstract question of law except as to the pending bill. The court observed that no sovereign power was delegated to the state committee, whose duties were governing its own political party, which alone was interested in performing those duties, and that membership in such a political committee was not under the definition of &quot;public office.&quot; The court opined that the fact that legislators deemed it expedient to regulate by statute election and conduct of political committees did not make it a public office because the members continued to be officers of the party electing them, and their duties pertained only to party matters, which they alone were interested in properly performing. The court concluded that appropriation and disbursement of tax money by the state committees as proposed by the pending bill would not be for a public purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The individual filed the suit against the town and, although she acknowledged that she had not complied with statutory notice requirements, argued that ch. 519 exempted her from such requirements. The town contended that ch. 519 was constitutionally invalid. On review, the court affirmed the order sustaining the town's demurrer to the individual's complaint. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that ch. 519 was unconstitutional because it provided a benefit only to the individual and thus deprived other similarly situated persons of equal treatment. The court then held that the town had standing to challenge the constitutionality of ch. 519 because the state's legislative body, the General Court, was permitted to pass laws controlling municipalities only to the extent that such laws were for the good and welfare of the Commonwealth. Thus, because ch. 519 was unconstitutional, the individual's failure to comply with statutory notice requirements barred her suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with possession of burglarious implements, and breaking and entering a dwelling house in the night time with intent to steal after he was detained by police officers, and most of the stolen items were in his possession. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that although the police officers did not have ground reasonably to believe that defendant had committed a felony, they did have reasonable grounds for brief initial inquiry, and, in view of defendant's first answers, to continue the questioning. The court then determined that the right of threshold inquiry did not include the right to search for evidence of crime in the absence of probable cause for arrest. The court reasoned that the officers could not inspect defendant's packages without his consent, unless there was a need to assure the officer's safety. The court then found that since the inspection of the packages was to verify defendant's story, and not to search for weapons, it was impermissible. However, the court remanded for further proceedings because the trial court had not examined the issue initially, and therefore had not determined the relevant facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commission was created by 1962 Mass.

The court held that the conferring of subpoena power did not affect the validity of the legislature's delegation of authority to the commission and was enforceable by the judiciary. The court held that the act's language setting forth the qualifications for appointment to the commission did not constitute a bill of attainder or an ex post facto law, but was instead intended to instill public confidence by requiring that the commission's members be persons of high integrity without a criminal background. The court also held that the resolve did not deny equal protection of the laws under the state and federal constitutions and that the doctrine of separation of powers was not violated.

A reading of the applicable statutes demonstrated that while a manufacturer in the commonwealth, irrespective of the number of its places of business, was subject to but a single annual license fee of $ 25, another manufacturer located outside the commonwealth had to pay an annual license fee of $ 25 for each place of business where there were manufactured &quot;harmful drugs&quot; which were shipped into the commonwealth.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff laundry owner sought review of a decision of the Superior Court (Massachusetts), which adjudicated a by-law and certain rules and regulations to be valid. The owner sought a binding declaration as to the validity of a by-law that was enacted by defendant town and provided for the licensing and regulation of laundries and as to the validity of certain rules and regulations that were promulgated by defendant board of selectmen.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owner contended that the by-law and the regulations violated U.S. Const. amend XIV and Mass Const. Decl. Rights arts. 1, 10, 12. The owner also argued that the by-law and regulations were not authorized by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40, &sect; 21, as amended. In affirming the decision, the court found that the right of a citizen to engage in a lawful private business was guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mass. Const. Decl. Rights arts. 1, 10. The owner, in substance, contended that laundries were beyond the reach of the municipal action that was attempted. The owner had the burden of proving the absence of any conceivable grounds upon which the by-law and regulations could be supported. A regulation prohibited the operation of a laundry before 6 a.m. or after 12 p.m. unless an attendant was present. The court thought that the board of selectmen could reasonably conclude that the regulation that prohibited the operation of a laundry before 6 a.m. or after 12 p.m. unless an attendant was present would serve to curb crime. The by-law and the regulations did not lack legislative authorization. All could come within Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40, &sect; 21(1), as amended.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed from an adverse judgment entered by the Middlesex Superior Court (Massachusetts).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The final decree ruled that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94, &sect; 187 was constitutional, the cream product was not an imitation milk product, and the application of &sect; 187 to the cream product would be unconstitutional. It enjoined defendants from prosecuting anyone for distributing, marketing, or selling the cream product or interfering with its distribution, use, or sale. The corporate owner's vice-president testified that the cream product was designed as a product that would color coffee so it would give a commodity a pleasing appetizing appearance. The cream product was a pasteurized blend of water, hydrogenated vegetable oils, dextrose, sucrose, enzyme modified casein, mono and diglycerides, protein stabilizers, salt, and artificial color. The court held that the cream product was an imitation of cream within the meaning of &sect; 187. The court ruled that the corporate owner had an intent to make a product which would closely resemble cream when used for the purpose for which it was developed and sold. The court also held that there was no showing that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94, &sect;&sect; 187, 189A, and 191 were unconstitutionally applied to the sale and distribution of the cream product.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was found guilty in a municipal court of parking in violation of a city traffic rule. Defendant argued that the appeals court erred in dismissing his challenge of the conviction on the ground that the provisions of Mass. Gen.

Defendant argued that under the statute he faced a small fine for a first offence in one calendar year if he accepted &quot;noncriminal disposition&quot; of his case, whereas if he insisted on a judicial determination he would be exposed to the possibility of a much larger fine. He also argued that the statute unconstitutionally provided that if he insisted on a judicial determination of his guilt he would have a criminal record, whereas he would not have such a record if he acknowledged his violation. The court overruled defendant's exceptions because the procedure with respect to parking offences authorized by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, &sect; 20A was not unreasonable or discriminatory. The court held that &sect; 20A was not an improper method of carrying out the obvious legislative purpose nor was it beyond the powers of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed the judgment, and the court reversed their convictions. The court held that the general search warrant that was used left too much to the individual judgment of the police officers executing the warrant and that a foreseeable consequence was that an unguided and unreasonable search would ensue in the store. The court stated that because the illegal generality was apparent from the warrant itself, application of the principles of case law required the suppression of the seized evidence from the store. The search and all that transpired at the store appeared to have been pursuant solely to the authority of the warrant, so that the court did not consider the search to have been a search incident to an arrest. The publications seized at the store were admitted into evidence generally at the trial, apparently with respect to all counts of all of the indictments against defendants, and the court ruled that this was prejudicial even as to counts not dealing with the illegally seized material.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appeared that while the defendant was serving a sentence as a prisoner in a penal institution for a sexual offence the superintendent thereof filed in the Superior Court a report of the prison psychiatrist and a motion for a temporary commitment of the defendant to a treatment center; and that following such commitment and the filing of the report of two psychiatrists the instant petition was filed by the District Attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commonwealth sought defendant's commitment following his temporary commitment to a treatment center and the filing of the report of two psychiatrists. The trial court, acting under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, found that defendant was a sexually dangerous person and ordered him committed to the treatment center. The court held that the trial court did not err in declining to rule that the alleged failure of the examining doctors to have both supervised the period of examination and diagnosis was fatal to the validity of the commitment proceeding. The statutory requirement was that the examination and diagnosis be under the supervision of not less than two psychiatrists. The psychiatrists did not have to be on the permanent staff. The statutory purpose was fully met because each psychiatrist went to the center several times a week, recommended a program of treatment, and was free to supervise in terms of requesting that psychological tests be done. Further, each psychiatrist interviewed defendant, examined his record, and considered the opinions of the staff. Thus, the examination and diagnosis were under the psychiatrists' supervision to the extent necessary to make the report.</SPAN></P>

The district court dismissed the delinquency complaint and defendant was bound over to the superior court. Defendant was indicted for second degree murder and pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Defendant appealed, arguing that he should be discharged because of the loss of juvenile jurisdiction over him. The court affirmed. The court stated that although Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 119 did not give the district court power to exercise jurisdiction over an adult pursuant to the juvenile procedures, the statute was not meant to place an adult beyond the reach of the criminal statutes for crimes committed when he was a minor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">1962 Mass. Acts ch. 583 authorized the city to prohibit the dumping of trash on certain lands within the city. The city, proceeding under the authority of the act, prohibited the operator from the further use of his property as a dumpsite, abrogating a permit granted to the operator by a health commissioner. The operator then filed a bill in equity seeking a declaration as to the constitutionality of the statute. The case was reported without any action by the trial court to the court. On review, the court held that the act, as it applied to the operator's land, was not tantamount to a taking of property without due process of law. The court noted that while the operator's business was effectively shut down, the record did not show that the land could not be filled and put to another use. The court determined, therefore, that the operator failed to demonstrate that there had been a complete deprivation of property so as to be the equivalent of a taking without compensation. The court concluded that the permit granted by the commissioner, which was expressly subject to revocation, did not confer upon the operator any vested rights that were immune from governmental action.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 101, and that if they were, chapter 101 was discriminatory and unconstitutional as applied to it and its employees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">&nbsp;Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 101, &sect; 22, provided that hawkers and peddlers were required to obtain licenses and were subject to certain local rules and regulations. Under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 101, &sect; 15, however, milk companies were exempted from the statute, and under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94, &sect; 40, they were subject to much less onerous licensing terms. The court first held that the bakery's drivers were hawkers or peddlers under the statute. The court then noted that dairies and bakeries were similarly situated in that both the bakery and milk companies exercised such supervision over their driver-salesman that neither business offered significant likelihood of fraud or harm to customers or other citizens. While businesses selling products from trucks could be made subject to special regulations, the statute was discriminatory as applied to the bakery, because it was situated similarly to milk companies. Finally, the court held that it could not simply sever the exception of milk dealers, because the legislature had expressly indicated that such sales were to be exempt.</SPAN></P>

There was no sign or other marking on the street prohibiting all night parking or parking after 11 p.m., but he was convicted and fined for violating a city ordinance that prohibited all night parking. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the ordinance was authorized by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40, &sect; 22, as amended by ch. 417, &sect; 1 (1957), which provided that a city or town could make ordinances or by-laws for the regulation of carriages and vehicles used therein. The court found that the statute was long standing and that its predecessors were enacted many years before motor vehicles came into use. The court found also that the ordinance did not cease to be effective in 1956 by the introduction of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40, &sect; 21, which contained an implied limitation upon the broad delegation in &sect; 22.

The taxpayer applied for abatements and when the commission denied the same, the taxpayer appealed to the lower court, which found that the timber income was taxable but the income from the isolated sale was not. Both parties appealed and the court reversed the judgment upholding the commission's refusal to abate the tax upon the income from the timber sale and affirmed the judgment as it related to the isolated sale of land interest. The court held that the substance of the tax upon income derived from business activities principally carried on in Maine was a tax upon the land and that Mass. Gen.

When the trust terminated, the Commissioner assessed a succession tax under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 65, &sect; 1 and the trustee sought to recover the taxes. The probate court reported the case without decision and the court dismissed the petition for abatement. The court held that the principal issue was whether the Massachusetts exemption in &sect; 1 applied to the succession to a future interest in property, occurring by reason of the death of an inhabitant of Massachusetts prior to July 1, 1940, but taking effect in possession and enjoyment after that date. That depended upon whether the scope of the exemption was to be determined under &sect; 1, as in force at the decedent's death in 1933, or as in force at the termination of the trust in 1957. In the absence of a clear legislative indication that some reciprocal exemption was to apply to the property of persons dying before July 1, 1940, the charitable exemptions in the instant case were governed by &sect; 1, as in effect at the decedent's death in 1933.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court ordered that a decree was to be entered in the probate court dismissing the petition of the trustee and others that sought abatement of the succession taxes.

The voters filed a bill in equity, opposing the transfer of the license. The holder of a liquor license filed a demurrer, which specified the non-joinder of the owner of the premises to which the transfer was sought. The holder of a liquor license also argued that the property was exempt from the distance requirement of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 138, &sect; 16C, because it was previously licensed for the sale of liquor. The court held that the owner of the premises was a necessary party to the action, pursuant to Mass. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The insurer filed an application with the redevelopment authority for approval of a construction project. The redevelopment authority approved the project, finding that the project area was a blighted open area and that the project was in the public interest. The insurer entered into an agreement with the bank to lease the property to the bank. The parties entered into a deposit agreement under which the law firm was to retain the lease until certain conditions were satisfied. Several conditions were met, but a dispute arose over whether certain legal conditions had been met. The law firm filed an action seeking a determination as to whether the conditions had been met. The court held, inter alia (1) the bank had standing to challenge certain findings made by the redevelopment authority because it was an &quot;aggrieved party&quot; within the meaning of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 652, &sect; 13, (2) the bank waived its right to challenge the redevelopment authority's findings by failing to resort to the review procedures set forth in ch. 652, &sect; 13, and (3) the tax concessions granted by the redevelopment authority were permissible because the elimination of a blighted open area was a public purpose.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the court reversed, finding that (1) since the enactment of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 84, &sect; 23, a public way could not be created by dedication; (2) the street was not opened and dedicated to the public use within the meaning of &sect; 23 because the declarations and acts of the landowners did not show a deliberate, unequivocal intent to abandon their property to the specific public use; (3) the lack of proper acceptance of the street as a public way was not validated by 1958 Mass. Acts ch. 563, &sect; 1 because it contained no provisions adequate to clarify the ambiguous 1951 town vote which left it uncertain whether the disputed area adjacent to plaintiff's land was accepted as a part of the street; and (4) the 1958 statute did not cure the ambiguities in the street vote.</SPAN></P>

At trial, there was evidence of defendants' admissions in conversations in the police station, which were overheard by a microphone. Defendants were convicted of second degree murder and conspiracy. The court held that there was no error in denying their motions for directed verdicts. By saying almost nothing, one defendant was, in effect, admitting what the other defendant said in his presence of their criminal actions, which he did not deny. The admission was enough to incriminate them as murderers and conspirators. The jury could have found the conspiracy continuing at least through the time when defendants called on the instigator to be paid for their acts.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 99 was not violated because the use of the microphone in the police station was under the exclusive control of the department, and the exception of Mass. Gen.

Petitioner filed requests for rulings of law at a hearing on his application and the district attorney's petition filed pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123A, &sect; 6. The contested order that dismissed petitioner's application was affirmed and his exceptions to the rulings of law were overruled. The superior court correctly denied defendant's motion to dismiss because he was a prisoner under sentence and the petition conformed to the preliminary requirements of ch. 123A, &sect; 6. The superior court incorrectly ruled that proceedings under ch. 123A were criminal in nature. The court ruled that those proceedings were civil. The superior court correctly denied petitioner's request for a ruling that ch. 123A, &sect; 6, was unconstitutional because that provision was neither vague nor indefinite when it clearly defined a certain mental condition and the procedural steps required before imposing any treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Each defendant was the owner and operator of a coin-operated automatic laundry. Defendants kept the Laundromats open on Sunday, although defendants and employees were not on the premises. Washers and dryers were in use by patrons. No laundry supplies were sold. The court disagreed that an automatic laundry operated in such a manner was not a &quot;shop&quot; within the meaning of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 136, &sect; 5 (Tercentenary ed. 1932). The court found that defendants' shops were open for doing business, as alleged in the complaints. The court noted that furnishing machines, water, and power in return for a consideration was doing business. The court observed that the sweeping effect of the statute embraced the Laundromats of which each defendant was the owner and operator, even without a sale of goods or the presence of employees. The court held there was nothing unconstitutional in the statute. As a matter of law, the court concluded that defendants did not sustain the burden of showing that the Legislature had no rational basis for making the exceptions found elsewhere in ch. 136, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

The statute, relating to the sale of obscene books, required knowledge of the indecent nature of the book, in order for the seller to be found guilty of violating the statute. However, the requirement of the following subsection was inapplicable here, because the court would not construe the statute involved as unconstitutional, when there was a constitutional interpretation. Additionally, in a section relating to the sale of obscene materials to minors, it was clearly stated that knowledge of the content of the materials was not required for conviction. The court held that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &sect; 28A was not in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 16.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Laws c. 63, &sect; 22 on the insurance company's international insurance sales was properly imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The insurance company was incorporated in Massachusetts. The insurance company also did business in foreign countries. However, the foreign countries in which the insurance company sold insurance imposed no excise tax. Therefore, the State Tax Commission imposed the state's insurance excise tax on the insurance company's international sales. The insurance company filed suit, contending the Commission's insurance excise tax imposed an unconstitutional burden on interstate and foreign commerce and violated the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. After analyzing the excise tax and federal law authorizing a state's right to impose insurance taxes, the court held the excise tax was not sufficiently related to imports or exports as to unconstitutionally burden foreign commerce. The court then held the excise tax fell within the state's allowable power to fairly approximate the value of franchises in imposing excise taxes; thus, the court held the excise tax did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The lessees were operating a piggery with 2,500 to 4,000 pigs on land they leased from the owner. The board of health adopted rules and regulations forbidding any piggery within the town. A piggery had been on the land for over 25 years before the lessee began its operation. The board served the lessees with an order stating the piggery was a nuisance and directing removal of the pigs. The trial court granted the board's motion to dismiss defendants' petition for a jury trial because they had not complied with the board's order pending the decision of the petition. The trial court entered a final decree permanently enjoining defendants from using the locus for a piggery and ordering the removal of the pigs. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court found that the board had the power to prohibit the piggery under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111, &sect; 143. The court concluded that because defendants did not comply with the order pending review, which was a valid condition for an appeal and provided administrative remedies, they were prohibited from showing that the board's order was invalid in its application to them.

The court held that the employee's right to recover was not affected by the stated fact that in certain years no appropriation was available. The court further held that the employee's failure to seek review of the initial classification for more than two years was not a waiver of his right to the additional compensation. The court also held that the employee was only entitled to 174.4 weeks of compensation for the difference in pay between his prior position and his newly classified position.

Laws ch. 123, &sect; 94A (amended 1959). The Commonwealth moved to dismiss, arguing that the probate court lacked jurisdiction as the inmate's rights were governed by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123, &sect; 101.The probate court took the motion under advisement. It then held that the inmate was sane and entitled to discharge, assuming jurisdiction. The case reached the court on report; the inmate argued that &sect; 101 was unconstitutional and that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123, &sect; 94A (amended 1959) was an alternate means of release. The court held that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123, &sect; 101, which allowed the governor to discharge the inmate if he was satisfied that a discharge would not cause danger to others, was not unconstitutional. While release under &sect; 101 was not the only method available, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123, &sect; 94A (amended 1959) was not a proper method because it applied to those found mentally ill, while the inmate was only found to lack criminal responsibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In an excise return under Mass. Gen.

Appellant assessed a deficiency, and appellee sought a correction. When appellant failed to abate the additional excise, appellee sought review by the Appellate Tax Board. It ruled that the annuity contract did not represent the carrying on of business with respect to which the excise tax was imposed. Since there was no express provision for the annuity, the matter was resolved in favor of the taxpayer. On appeal, the court considered the provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 63, &sect; 20, in connection with the relevant provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175.

A jury returned verdicts for the administratrix, and the trial court entered a verdict for the administrator on each count. The court held that there was no error in overruling the administrator's plea to jurisdiction. There was no constitutional provision that prevented the legislature from authorizing service of process for the purpose of bringing personal representatives into the courts. The jurisdiction was based upon consent, which arose from the operation of the automobile within the commonwealth. It could not have been ruled as matter of law that there was no evidence of gross negligence. There could have been a voluntary incurring of an obvious risk and a persistence in a palpably negligent course of conduct over an appreciable period of time.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant trailer owner challenged a final decree from the Superior Court, Hampshire (Massachusetts), which enjoined the trailer owner from having or using trailers on his land in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140 and plaintiff Town's zoning by-law unless he obtained proper licenses or permits from the Town and the board of health. The decree also ordered removal of the trailers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">No zoning plan had been adopted. Parcel 1 was divided into seven lots with two trailers on one of them, having been placed there after passage of the by-law. There was one trailer located and occupied on Parcel 2. No permits had been obtained for sewage installations. The trailer owner contended the by-law was invalid in that the statutory provision for adoption of zones meant that valid zoning by-laws had to set up zones. No nonconforming use was contended. The court found the by-law a valid exercise of the zoning power. The court explained that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40A did not make compulsory a division of the town into zones or the adoption of a comprehensive plan as a condition of any exercise of the power, but the effect of the by-law was to confine occupied trailers to parks licensed under ch. 140, &sect; 32B, and to limit the number of locations of unoccupied trailers. The court held it was not arbitrary to restrict all land in the Town so that trailers could be lived in, or grouped, only in a licensed trailer camp. The court concluded the tendency of the by-law was to place together occupied trailers, facilitating regulation and supervision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court modified the final decree to enjoin the keeping of more than one trailer on parcel 1 or parcel 2, and the use for living quarters of any trailer on parcel 1, unless pursuant to a trailer park license as provided by statute. As so modified, the decree was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The legislature reapportioned state senatorial and councilor districts, but did not reapportion representative districts. The effect of this was that voters would be in one district for senatorial and councilor elections and in a different district for elections of representatives. Petitioners sought mandamus to prohibit the preparation of ballots pursuant to the new districts. The court dismissed the petitions, holding that mandamus did not lie against the legislature. The court agreed that Mass. Const. art. 21 and art. 22 contemplated reapportionment of representatives and senatorial and councilor districts by the same session of the legislature, and agreed further that the legislature's failure to reapportion the representative districts thwarted the constitutional intendments. The court held, however, that even more serious nullification of the constitutional purpose would result under a construction that would permit only the first regular session following the return to reapportion the districts. The court noted that the undesirable result of two sets of districts would be overcome when the legislature acted to reapportion representative districts in its next session.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, minority stockholders, challenged a decreed from the Plymouth Superior Court (Massachusetts), which held in favor of defendants, a corporation and others, and dismissed the stockholders' bill of complaint. The stockholders sought to enjoin the sale and rental at retail of heaters, stoves, and other appliances that used gas as a fuel as beyond the scope of the corporation's charter powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The scope of the corporation's charter powers was the manufacture and sale of gas. The trial court determined that the sale and rental of appliances proved very profitable to the corporation. While such sales and rentals were profitable, the corporation was principally interested in increasing the sale of gas. The trial court ruled that the complained of transactions were fairly incidental and auxiliary to the main business and dismissed the bill. The court affirmed. When the case came on for trial, the stockholders filed a motion to strike four paragraphs of the answer for failure to comply with Mass. Super. Ct. R. 29. The trial court properly denied the motion. Rule 29 required full, direct, and specific answers and the avoidance of any general denial. The court held that it was within the trial court's discretion to deny the motion to strike and to order that the trial proceed. The answer did not comply with R. 29 and the granting of the motion would have been appropriate had it been presented at an earlier time. In the circumstances, however, the parties were in court and the case was set down for hearing. The trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

The court answered only that question and did so in the negative. The court found that where the whole scheme was not distinctly defined in the proposed statute, the determination as to whether it constituted a public purpose was in the domain of speculation and that the bill did not provide its own clear statement as to what it required. The court further found that if there was to be a delegation of authority for the approval, the details or standards for the approval had to be specified, and any action had to be made subject to review of the adequacy of compliance with standards. The court concluded that the project had to be demonstrably of a character reasonably justifying separate classification and treatment for tax exemption and that it had to be, on the face of the statute, for a predominantly public purpose.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the demurrer of the Commissioner. In affirming, the court held that while it was expected that only on rare occasions will matters contemplated by the foregoing sections be brought before the court, nevertheless, because of the centralization of records and the great public interest which could have been involved in such cases, the best interests of all parties concerned and the public would have been served by retaining exclusive jurisdiction of such matters in the court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner taxpayers brought an action under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 29, &sect; 63, to seek a ruling that respondents, the treasurer and the receiver general, could not expend money or incur obligations purporting to bind the Commonwealth under 1953 Mass. Acts ch. 606 as amended by 1959 Mass Acts. ch. 608. The taxpayers asserted that the amending statute was enacted, unconstitutionally, without a yea and nay vote of 2/3 of each house present and voting.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The general court provided for the construction, maintenance, repair, and operation of a toll tramway, a tramway authority, and financing for the project. 1959 Mass.

Acts ch. 606 by enacting the Commonwealth's guaranty of the interest on the tramway authority's bonds and authorized the treasurer to borrow for the purpose of the guaranty. The court noted the petition was properly brought under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 29, &sect; 63. The court rejected the construction that 1959 Mass. Acts ch. 608, &sect; 4, authorized a borrowing in anticipation of receipts. The court opined that it was true that the statute committed the amounts to be borrowed to the purpose of paying the deficiencies of bond interest, but such commitment did not change the purpose of the borrowing. The court explained that what &sect; 4 purported to authorize was a borrowing to pay an obligation in the absence of an appropriation to pay that obligation, which was a borrowing to create receipts from which the obligation could be paid, not a borrowing in anticipation of receipts. The court concluded it was a borrowing requiring a 2/3 vote of each house taken by yeas and nays.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court instructed that the decree would provide that the treasurer and receiver general could not borrow or pay from funds raised by taxation deficiencies in interest on the bonds of the tramway authority.</SPAN></P>

The case was reserved and reported without decision by a single justice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxable inhabitants claimed that 1958 Mass. Acts ch. 603, which incorporated the association for the sole purpose of constructing a state office building, violated Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 62, &sect; 3. They argued that the statutory scheme was in substance a borrowing of money by the commonwealth without a vote, taken by the yeas and nays, of two-thirds of each house of the general court present and voting. The court agreed and enjoined the expenditure, reasoning that the purpose of art. 62, &sect; 3 was to put fetters on the legislature. Although the association was a separate entity that could contract and issue bonds, sue and be sued, those attributes were not enough to meet the constitutional challenge. The association was nothing more than an intermediary to carry out the sole purpose of constructing and &quot;leasing&quot; to the commonwealth a building for the exclusive use of the commonwealth. The court distinguished other cases in which entities existed for more than a single, temporary purpose. The court concluded that the statute violated art. 62, &sect; 3 and was void upon its face and that to hold otherwise would be to exalt artifice above reality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court ordered entry of a final decree which (1) declared the statute invalid under the state constitution and (2) enjoined the respondents from expending money, incurring obligations, or doing any act pursuant thereto.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the trial court rightly denied the motions to quash the indictments. It was not error for the trial judge not to require the prosecution to file a demurrer or replication to the pleas in abatement, the only special pleadings now material. No case had been cited or discovered by the court, which held that the publicity was a violation of the secrecy of the grand jury room. Due to the extensive publicity, it did not follow that the inevitable result was that defendants must have been released because defendants could have never constitutionally been tried or that the particular indictments should have been quashed. The court could not have concluded that defendants' convictions should have been set aside because of the trial date. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in putting defendants on trial on the conspiracy indictments along with the more serious substantive offences. The court held that no harmful error was revealed when defendants used 45 of their peremptory challenges upon 45 veniremen who were ruled to be indifferent. Thus, the court affirmed the judgments of conviction.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 231A requesting that the trial court declare the city's housing ordinance unconstitutional and invalid. The trial court entered judgment for the property owners and the city appealed. In reversing the trial court's judgment, the court held that the trial court erred. The court found that the trial court erred in ruling that the ordinance vested in the superintendent of public buildings the power to enforce the ordinance without any right of review by an appellate authority. In reading the ordinance, the court determined that there was a right to judicial review. The court also found that the property owners had not been issued any notices of violation by the city that would have entitled them to claim that the application of the ordinance provisions was arbitrary or capricious. The court concluded that the limitations placed on the conditions of occupancy for the dwellings were not an illegal invasion of the owners' property rights but was a proper exercise of the city's police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff bar owner filed a bill in equity for a declaratory decree against defendants, a city and a licensing board. The question was whether Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 183A, and Boston, Mass. Rev. Ordinances ch. 40A, &sect; 1, cl. 92 (1947) were inapplicable or void as to the bar.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The bar owner maintained two television sets and a radio set by which on weekdays he made regularly broadcasted programs available to customers. He also maintained a coin-operated jukebox. The bar owner contended that he had the right to furnish to customers public entertainment through the use of television, radio, and jukebox without obtaining any license pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect; 183A, or paying any license fee under Boston, Mass., Rev. Ordinances ch. 40A, &sect; 1, cl. 92 (1947). The court disagreed. The court found that the purpose of the licensing statutes was to regulate anyone who provided entertainment in connection with the business of furnishing food or drink. The fact that the media used by the bar for entertainment were not mentioned in the statutes was irrelevant because the wording of the statutes was meant to encompass later-developed technology. The statutes were not censorship statutes because the granting or denial of a license was not based on the content of the entertainment. The statutes constitutionally had the purpose of preserving public order by notifying the authorities of where large groups of people gathered for entertainment purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court ordered that a final decree was to be entered declaring that the bar's activities fell within the licensing statutes at issue, the provisions of which were not unconstitutional or void as applied to the bar.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Senate proposed a bill that was intended to restrict dower and curtesy claims to land owned at the death of a claimant's spouse. The proposed bill required the claimant to make an election within a specified time frame in order to be entitled to dower or curtesy. The Senate submitted two questions to the Justices for an analysis of the constitutionality of the proposed bill. The Justices submitted a response to the first question and requested that they be excused from making a separate answer to the second question based on their contention that the answer given effectively covered both questions. The Senate specifically asked the Justices whether the proposed bill, if enacted into law, could have constitutionally applied to inchoate rights of dower or curtesy as they existed prior to the effective date under U.S. Const. Art. I, &sect; 10, in so far as those sections forbid any state to make any law impairing the obligation of contracts, or U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The Justices answered in the affirmative and reasoned that as a matter of public policy the Legislature could restrict dower and curtesy clams in the manner proposed.</SPAN></P>

Acts 354, &sect; 5(I), the no-access provision, again by eminent domain took a permanent easement across both estates. The MTA then granted easements to each estate. The servient estate owner argued that the taking of the permanent easement was not for a public purpose and therefore invalid. The court disagreed and issued a declaratory decree that held the taking was valid. The MTA was a public instrumentality authorized to perform the essential governmental function of building a turnpike pursuant to 1952 Mass. Acts 354, &sect; 3. Pursuant to 1952 Mass. Acts 354, &sect; 5(k) the MTA could exercise the power of eminent domain as it deemed necessary for the protection of the turnpike.

The seller argued that there was a gift since there was no charge for the antifreeze and that the only subject of the advertisement and sale was the tire.

Laws ch. 93, &sect; 14A et seq., to enjoin defendant supermarkets from issuing trading stamps or cash register receipts, redeemable in merchandise, in connection with sales of fair traded items. The Superior Court (Massachusetts), reported the case without decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The supermarkets issued trading stamps or cash register receipts, redeemable in merchandise, on all items purchased, including fair traded items. The manufacturer claimed that the stamp and tape plans constituted price cutting forbidden by the fair trade law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93, &sect; 14A et seq., and sought to enjoin the plans. The trial court reported the case without decision and the court granted injunctive relief. The court noted that under the plans, a direct and tangible benefit was received by the customer, which was specifically and inseparably related to the article purchased and its price. The court found that the plans were, in effect, a price cut. The fact that the discounts were de minimis was not material. The court held that the supermarkets could issue trading stamps on fair traded items, so long as they were issued in such a way that the effective sale price was not below the minimum resale price. The court held that the fair trade law was not unconstitutional under the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

Acts ch. 747, and three intervening bondholders, took exceptions to a judgment from the Superior Court, Bristol (Massachusetts), which granted petitioner city's request for a writ of mandamus and commanded the board and its members to comply with the provisions of ch. 747. One of the members filed a separate bill of exceptions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Authority was created by 1948 Mass. Acts ch. 544 to provide transportation between the islands and the mainland. After the Authority suspended service to and from New Bedford during the winter of 1955-1956, the legislature enacted 1956 Mass. Acts ch. 747, which required the Authority to provide daily service throughout the year and to construct adequate ferry slips or transfer bridges at the ports to accommodate truck traffic. The court modified the judgment and affirmed it as modified. The court held that ch. 747 did not substantially impair the contractual rights or vested interests of the bondholders because 1948 Mass. Acts ch. 544 provided adequate assurances against loss and did not restrict the Commonwealth's powers to act in the interest of the public to secure adequate transportation. The court determined that bonds issued by the Authority under 1948 Mass. Acts ch. 544, &sect; 6, were held subject to the possible exercise of that police power and found no absence of due process in its exercise. The court held that the scope of the order for judgment was too broad because only two specific subjects were before the court, winter service and the construction of a ferry slip.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court overruled the exceptions and ruled that the order for judgment should be reframed and confined to the two specific subjects that were before the trial court, winter service and the construction of a ferry slip, and should be affirmed as so moulded.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer sought an abatement of its corporate excise tax that was imposed by the tax commission under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 63, &sect; 32 (1939). The taxpayer claimed that the tax on net income as measured by sales in interstate commerce violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The Appellate Tax Board granted the abatement. The court reversed and granted judgment to the tax commission, determining that the taxpayer was not entitled to have any abatement of its corporate excise measured by net income. The excise imposed by &sect; 32 was not a tax upon or measured by gross receipts of the corporation. The excise was not imposed with respect to any activity that was part of the stream of interstate commerce, but rather was laid on the existence of corporate privileges. There was no evidence that the excise discriminated against interstate commerce. The excise, measured by net income and apportioned in a practical way to give a reasonable approximation of values attributable to the taxing state granting the privileges, did not violate the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landowners brought three suits in equity. The bills of complaint sought to enjoin action under 1946 Mass.

Each bill also contained a prayer that the superior court determine that any taking by the city of the land owned and operated by the landowners for public parking purposes was contrary to law. The cases were heard together. The final decree in each case adjudged that 1946 Mass. Acts ch. 474 was constitutional and that the city was authorized to take the landowners' property for the purposes set forth. The court found that the fact that private operators could be expected to profit from the operation of the buildings did not mean that the statutory plan was not for a public purpose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owner erected a covered wooden bin for the storage of wood shavings.

The town filed suit to require the owner to remove the bin. The trial court found that the bin was not a structure and dismissed the suit. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's judgment was subject to affirmance because the evidence was not reported, and, thus, there was no adequate basis for testing the trial court's conclusion that the new bin was not a structure, meaning that it did not have that solidity to bring it within the prohibition of Manchester, Mass., Zoning Bylaw &sect; IV, forbidding the replacement of nonconforming structures without a permit. The court found that it could not say, as a matter of law, that the replacement or modification of every insubstantial shed or auxiliary outbuilding, used in connection with a nonconforming use, must be regarded as action with respect to a structure that was subject to regulation.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the court held that: 1) plaintiffs' conduct went beyond the legitimate field of lay business and into the field that public policy required reserved for lawyers; 2) the debt pooler's plan and its administration excluded the debtor from skilled professional legal advice; 3) the statute was not an unconstitutional interference with the judicial function of determining who practiced law, but was a valid enactment to assist such function; and 4) injunctive relief was expressly authorized by 1955 Mass. Acts 697, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court entered a decree in favor of the bar associations in plaintiffs' action for a declaration that a statute prohibiting advice to debtors in connection with debt pooling plans by nonlawyers was unconstitutional. The court found the statute was constitutional and entered an order enjoining plaintiffs from further violations of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The commission had denied the application as filed too late under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62, &sect; 43. The taxpayer then appealed to the Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer requested a partial abatement of a tax on income for the calendar year of 1951. The tax had been paid in accordance with a return filed on April 15, 1952. The taxpayer filed an application for abatement on April 13, 1955, claiming an error in the return he filed on April 15, 1952. The question presented was whether the amendment of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 62, &sect; 43 applied to the taxpayer's application. The amendment extended the time for filing an application for an abatement of income tax to three years, instead of one year, from the filing of the return. In other words, the court considered whether the taxpayer's right to file such an application expired on April 15, 1953, or whether it was extended to April 15, 1955. The court applied the principle that where the State enacted retroactive legislation impairing its own rights, it could not be heard to complain on constitutional grounds.The court ruled that the time was extended and the decision of the Board was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the decision of the Board dismissing the taxpayer's appeal, and the case was ordered to stand for further hearing before the Board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners, taxpayers comprised of individuals and corporations, sought review of the final decree of the superior court (Massachusetts), which dismissed their 10 taxpayers' action brought against respondents, city, tax assessors, and garage lessee. The taxpayers had argued that their being taxed while the city's garage lessee was statutorily exempt violated their constitutional right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The superior court dismissed the taxpayers' action when it sustained the demurrers to the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the action, but instructed the superior court to enter a decree that declared that the taxpayers were not entitled to any affirmative or injunctive relief, and that the exemption of the city's leased property from taxation, pursuant to statute, did not deprive the taxpayers of equal protection. The court held that (1) the explicit statutory tax exemption was a valid exercise of the supreme authority of the legislature with respect to the Boston Common, even though the garage was leased by the city to a private corporation for profit because the exemption facilitated the broad public purpose traffic congestion abatement; (2) the fact that the garage lessee was not subject to public regulation was not fatal to the tax exemption, as argued by the taxpayers, because whether to include such in the scheme was a matter for the legislature to determine; and (3) separate classification for taxation or exemption of property used for a public purpose was within the legislative discretion and did not constitute an unconstitutional discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgments denying the pharmacist's petitions for a writ of certiorari to review and quash the commission's proceedings and for a writ of mandamus to direct the commission to approve the application. The court held that the commission did not act unreasonably in disapproving the acts of the local licensing board, giving due weight to the commission's specialized knowledge of the problems affecting the regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages. The commission properly considered factors such as the existing patronage by school children of the pharmacist's drug store and the proximity of churches and schools. The commission was not required to state its reasons for disapproving the application. The legislative provision limiting licenses to those applicants approved by the commission was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff sought review, and the court held that the trial court erred by refusing process against defendants not served, and that the motions to dismiss were not in accordance with established equity practice. The court held that a demurrer was the proper method in equity of raising a question of jurisdiction over the subject matter alleged and, therefore, it treated the motions as such. The court held that a member or officer of the legislature had no immunity from the service of civil process when no arrest was made, and that the clerks did not stand in any better position.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Senate submitted questions to the court pertaining to the validity of a legislative bill that attempted to create a municipal port authority for the operation and financing of an existing vehicular tunnel. Upon reviewing the proposed legislation, the court found that overall the legislation was constitutionally valid. The court held that the pending bill was an act of incorporation within the meaning of Mass. Const. art. 59, but that the bill did not violate art. 59 because the incorporation was subject to revocation and amendment that would not defeat or substantially impair without compensations rights vested under the legislation. The court determined that the proposed legislation did not impair the rights created under Mass. Stat. ch. 297, &sect; 12 (1929) if under the proposed bill the holders of tunnel bonds were as secure as they were under the older statute. The court concluded that provisions in the pending bill concerning a trust agreement did not go beyond permissible delegation by leaving the terms of the agreement up to the port authority where the legislature indicated a broad outline of the authority's purposes and methods by which they were to be accomplished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court answered these questions from the Massachusetts Senate: Is the proposed bill contrary to Mass. Const. amend. art. LXIII budget and appropriation requirements and unconstitutional? Does delegating appropriation powers to the Fish and Game Board violate Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. XXX? Would enactment before final action on the General Appropriation Bill without the Governor's recommendation violate Mass. Const. amend. art. LXIII, &sect; 3?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A proposed bill pending before the Massachusetts Senate provided that the Inland Fisheries and Game Fund, except for $ 500,000 in reserve, was to be administered by the Fish and Game Board for the same 11 purposes it previously had, but without appropriation. The court held that the money received from license fees, fines, permit fees, and other sources pertaining to inland fishing and hunting and sums received from the Federal government as reimbursements, which went, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 131, &sect; 3A, into the Fund, was money received &quot;on account of&quot; the Commonwealth, was to be paid into the state treasury under Mass. Const. amend. art. LXIII, &sect; 1, was to be stated in the budget under Mass. Const. amend. art. LXIII, &sect; 2, and was to be disbursed under the General Appropriation Bill or a supplementary or special appropriation bill under Mass. Const. amend. art. LXIII, &sect;&sect; 3-4. The court opined that the purpose of Mass. Const. amend. art. LXIII would be defeated if income, after being channeled into special funds, could then be expended by administrative officers without appropriation, and that it would violate Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. XXX relating to separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The town enacted an emergency law permitting local rent control. The tenant was living in a rent-controlled apartment when her landlord sought and received permission from the rent control board to increase the rent. The tenant claimed that the approval was issued without any hearing or any determination of whether the landlord was receiving a fair net operating income; thus, she was denied due process. The lower court found that the board acted fairly in carrying out its administrative authority and the appellate court dismissed a report. The court agreed with the lower court's reasoning that the board was not required to make a determination of whether or not any petitioning landlord was receiving rent adequate to produce fair net operating income as a condition precedent to permitting any increase. The court found that any rights the tenant had were not vested and that the controversy had become moot; it dismissed the action on that ground.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The research foundation, doctor, and proprietors challenged an interlocutory decree issued by the trial court that sustained a demurrer by the publisher and a final decree that dismissed the bill of complaint seeking to enjoin publication and distribution by publisher of a book. The research foundation, doctor, and proprietors alleged that the book contained false, fraudulent, wrongful, malicious, and erroneous statements which tended to injure and destroy their good name and professional reputation and the commercial value of the drug mentioned in the book. The court affirmed the interlocutory and final decrees because the public interest in the discussion of cancer cures was a sufficient basis for a denial of an injunction. The injunction was properly denied because of constitutional rights and public interest, where the public interest in the discussion of cancer and the constitutional protection of free press were paramount. To have allowed prior restraint provided only that the trial judge was convinced of the falsity of the proposed publication amounted to unconstitutional censorship.</SPAN></P>

The Commission had suspended the stores' licenses for violating a price fixing statute,&nbsp;Mass. Gen.

In a consolidated trial, the case was reported to the court without decision.

Their duty was merely to investigate and to report facts to the general court upon which that body could take such action, if any, as it saw fit.

The senate posed a series of questions for the justices to address in their opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Massachusetts Senate had before it a proposed Massachusetts House act relating to the creation of a historic districts commission for the town of Nantucket, and sought the opinion of the justices relating to the constitutionality of various provisions. The bill would have restricted owners from building, modifying or razing buildings without first obtaining a permit and further restricted the construction or display of signs. The court opined that the proposed act did not appear to constitute an impermissible taking of property. The court stated that the legislature had authority, under its police power, to regulate the use of property in the interest of public safety, health, morals, and welfare, and that the proposed act appeared to be one related to welfare. The court indicated that the act resembled a zoning measure, the constitutionality of which had long been established. The justices declined to answer certain questions relating to the constitutionality of various provisions, indicating that they were of the opinion that they were not required by the state constitution to answer those kinds of questions without being directed to a particular question.</SPAN></P>

The court declined to answer the senate's generic questions as to the bill's constitutionality, indicating that the state constitution did not require the justices to answer questions of that nature.</SPAN></P>

The corporation applied to the public safety commissioner for his written approval, and to the city manager for a license, to exhibit a certain film in its theater on Sundays.

The corporation then commenced the instant action contending that the film had been shown in the theatre on weekdays, and was not of such a character as to disturb the peace and quiet of the Lord's day or to interfere with its due observance. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the bill and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court found that the bill stated a proper case for a binding declaration and the demurrer should not have been sustained. The court found that Mass. Gen.

Laws ch. 59, &sect; 39 provided for special assessments against taxpayers, such as telegraph and telephone companies, which owned poles, wires, and underground conduits. Instead of following the procedure set out in the statute, the assessors used their own formula to calculate the taxes owed by the taxpayer. The taxpayer applied for an abatement, which was granted by the tax board. The assessors sought review, contending that the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the abatement. The court held that the method of determining the tax set forth in the statute did not violate the constitutional requirement that assessments, rates, and taxes be reasonable. The court found that the assessors were not denied due process because the statute did not give them the same rights as the taxpayer. The court also found that the statute did not deny telegraph and telephone companies equal protection because it described a different method of assessing property for such entities. The court held that the assessors did not have standing to raise the constitutional question because the statute did not adversely affect them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff property owners sought review of an interlocutory decree by the Superior Court (Massachusetts), which sustained a demurrer to the property owners' bill in equity to enjoin defendants, a city and its housing authority, from taking steps to acquire their property by eminent domain in order to effect a plan to clear a slum and replace it with light industry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The property owners objected to the redevelopment plan on the ground that defendants' conduct was arbitrary, not because of what defendants did or proposed to do but because of their motive in doing it. The property owners alleged that defendants were not attempting to clear a slum, but were acting on a desire to change the area from one predominantly residential to one exclusively industrial, in order to increase taxable real estate and personal property valuations and to compete with other municipalities in the attraction of new industrial enterprises. The court disagreed, noting that defendants' findings were supported by the evidence and that there was no allegation that defendants' motives were dishonest or malicious. The court held that the plan's references to financial benefits to the city did not establish that its dominant purpose was to achieve anything outside the scope of the housing authority's power under Mass. Gen. Laws ch.121, &sect; 26LL. It reasoned that in determining whether a project was one that ought to be undertaken it was proper to give some consideration to the economic effects upon the city that was expected to pay one third of the cost.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners, a Jewish couple, filed an appeal from a decision by the Probate Court, Essex County (Massachusetts), which dismissed their petition to adopt twin children based on Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 210, &sect; 5B (Ter. ed.). Petitioners contended that &sect; 5B was unconstitutional under the U.S. Const. amend. I, and Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 2, Mass. Const. amend. arts. 11, and Mass. Const. amend. Art. 46, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A Jewish couple sought to adopt twin children and raised them as Jewish. The mother of the children was a Catholic, but did not object to the couple's desire to adopt her children. Nevertheless, the probate court dismissed the couple's petition, finding that there were many Catholic couples of fine family life and excellent reputation who had filed applications with the Catholic Charities Bureau for the purpose of adopting Catholic children. The couple objected to the lack of definite proof that suitable Catholic persons had actually seen the children and stood ready to adopt both of them at one time. On appeal, the court affirmed the probate court's decision because the couple's objection to the evidence was general and the court found that the &quot;line&quot; of evidence was competent. The court determined that the probate court's findings were practicable because they were based on elements of fact and there was no evidence that the mother would have refused her consent to adoption by any persons other than the Jewish couple. Additionally, the court found that &sect; 5B was not unconstitutional because no burden was placed upon anyone for the maintenance of any religion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Under a &quot;cooperation agreement&quot; between the City and the Authority in connection with a proposed slum clearance project, the Authority was to take all land within an area by eminent domain and sell it to private parties for redevelopment for private uses. The landowner brought an action against the City and the Authority for a declaration as to the right of the Authority to take the landowner's land by eminent domain. The taxpayers brought an action to restrain the city from expending public funds on the project. The trial court sustained demurrers to both actions filed by the City and the Authority. The landowner and taxpayers appealed, contending that the Massachusetts Housing Authority Law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 574, &sect; 1, unlawfully authorized the exercise of the eminent domain power and the expenditure of public funds for the acquisition of land to be sold to private persons. On appeal, the court held that the disposition of the land by sale was incidental to the main purpose of the plan, slum clearance, and that once the public purpose contemplated by the statute had been achieved, the Authority was not obliged to retain the cleared land as unproductive property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court directed a decree to be entered declaring that the Authority had a right to take the landowner's property by eminent domain.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The inmate contended that the statute under which he was committed, 1953 Mass. Acts ch. 645, was unconstitutional. From the description of the persons to whom the law was intended to relate, the court found that they comprised a class over which the legislature had not only the right, but the duty to exercise supervision. The court further found that the words &quot;mentally defective&quot; described persons whose mentality was less than normal, and that the term &quot;dangerous&quot; meant one likely to cause or create danger. The court also found that it could not be said that in providing for the commitment of mentally defective persons who were dangerous or could become so the legislature had failed to establish a reasonable and practical standard for the guidance of the courts. The court concluded that the essential elements of due process were satisfied by the statute's provisions for notice and opportunity to be heard and that none of the inmate's requested rulings could properly have been granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1953 a rent control law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 29, &sect; 63 was passed by the Massachusetts Legislature. The law permitted reimbursement by cities and towns from the state to control rents. The law exempted certain new homes from the controls. The residents alleged that the law was neither necessary as an emergency measure nor was it Constitutional. The court dismissed the residents' petition seeking an injunction against respondents. The court ruled that the law did not violate Mass Const. amend. art. 28 as the law's preamble contained the required statement of purpose. The court also ruled that the exemptions in the law were neither arbitrary nor inequitable as evidence showed that that exemption for new homes was consistent with the purpose of the law to provide more available residential housing units for rent. The court also held that as the enactment of the law was appropriate, its delegation of powers to the cities and towns as agencies was a reasonable extension of its police power.

In answer to questions propounded by the house, the court concluded that the provisions of the proposed bill were constitutional and valid. The court found that the pending bill was in substance a bill for the relief of a class of needy persons, and it was for the legislature to determine within reason the amount of relief and the manner in which it was to be granted, and the bill's classification of persons eligible was reasonable and nondiscriminatory. Private property could not be taken by eminent domain or paid for by public money merely for the purpose of disposing of it to or for the benefit of private individuals. However, underlying the pending bill and supporting its provisions was the public purpose of relief to a class of aged, needy, and indigent persons.

Gen. Laws ch. 140, &sect;32G. The landowner owned a parcel of real estate upon which he operated a trailer coach park under a license issued to him by the board of health of defendant city. The case was reserved and reported without decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city had filed an answer alleging vaguely without specification of any sort that the statute was &quot;invalid and unconstitutional.&quot; The landowner took the position that the statute was constitutional. The court found that, ignoring 1952 Mass. Acts ch. 583, the city assessors had assessed to the landowner a real estate tax on the value of trailer coaches then occupying space in his park, and the city collector of taxes refused to accept from the landowner sums he had collected from the owners of trailer coaches in his park. The court found that the city had flouted the act of the legislature, but had not troubled to come into court to present its views. The categorical assertion of unconstitutionality in the answer was of no help in deciding the case. The court had not even been told whether the allusion was to the State or Federal Constitution or to both. At most, the only question presented was whether the statute was unconstitutional because other people's trailer coaches could no longer be taxed to a park owner as part of his real estate. Lacking any support for the affirmative of the proposition, the court stated that it was unable to perceive any constitutional objection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court ordered that a final decree was to be entered declaring, among other things, that the statute was valid and constitutional and ordering the city collector of taxes to accept sums of money collected by the landowner from the owners of trailer coaches occupying space in his trailer coach park.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A man died intestate and left petitioners as his heirs. The public administrator deposited petitioners' distributive shares in bank accounts for their benefit. Petitioners, through the consul general of Poland, brought petitions to require payment to them of the balances of the bank accounts. The trial court made an order that required the appearance in person of petitioners before the court and found that it was practically impossible for them to come to the court, which effectively barred them from recovering the funds. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the trial court could require the appearance of petitioners under Mass. Rev. Laws ch. 206, &sect; 27A, and that petitioners had no right under any treaty to seize their property regardless of this law. The court determined that this law did not discriminate against nationals of foreign countries. The court also found that the there was no reasonable assurance that the money would be received by petitioners at full value, and instead they would receive 20 percent of value, and that the money should not be sent pursuant to 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 123 until a realistic rate of exchange was adopted by Poland.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commissioner determined valuation of certain utility property for tax purposes. The assessors challenged the determination to the tax board, which increased the valuation substantially. The commissioner filed a motion to dismiss the challenge, that the tax board denied. The commissioner then sought judicial review contending that the motion to dismiss should have been granted. The court noted that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 59, &sect; 73, as amended by 1933 Mass Acts 254, &sect; 44, required a corporation, if it wished an abatement, to apply for it to the commissioner within a certain time frame. In the instant matter, the tax board delayed its decision as to valuation until the time for requesting an abatement had expired. Therefore, the motion to dismiss should have been granted, as the matter was rendered moot. According, the decision was reversed, and the order denying the commissioner's motion to dismiss was ordered granted on the ground of mootness.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that this question was designed to ask whether the general plan or scheme of 1952 Mass. Acts 354 whereby power was delegated to the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority to construct the &quot;Massachusetts Turnpike&quot; from a point in the vicinity of Boston to a point at or near the New York line and to exercise rights of eminent domain for that purpose, without further specification in the grant of powers of the location of the turnpike or of the property authorized to be taken, was constitutional without consideration of another particular provision of 1952 Mass. Acts 354. To this question, so construed, the court answered &quot;yes.&quot; In dealing with this question in this manner, the court did not mean to imply that the court had discovered constitutional difficulties in any part of 1952 Mass. Acts 354 to which no reference was made in the questions or in the court's answers.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Serv. Comm'n R. 21 as well as challenging the conduct of respondent director and commissioners of the Massachusetts Civil Service Commission in enforcing that rule, which granted additional points to military veterans who took civil service examinations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The officers claimed that they were unconstitutionally disadvantaged by a commission rule adding two points to test scores of veterans on civil service examinations which determined the promotion of officers in fire and police departments. In one case, the officers would have been certified for promotion but for the operation of the challenged rule while in the other case, the officer would not have been certified in any event. After a single justice denied relief, the officers appealed but the court affirmed. While holding that the officers were entitled to challenge the validity of Rule 21 because it adversely affected them, it held that where, as here, the fitness of a veteran to be appointed or promoted was determined by an examination, a veteran might be given a preference in actual employment. It rejected the proposition that preferences in promotion were constitutionally unacceptable while preferences in original appointment were not. It also found no merit to the officers' claim that Rule 21 was void based on unlawful delegation to the Commission or that some lack of clarity as to its intended effect prevented it from being applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgments dismissing the officers' petitions challenging the validity of the civil service rule according a preference to veterans.</SPAN></P>

Acts ch. 203, which provided that a person convicted of murder in the first degree was not eligible for parole, was an ex post facto law in violation of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10.

The court held that the dependency allowance did not violate the equal pay law. The court held that the committee vote did not discriminate between the sexes because although more men qualified for the allowance, women teachers who qualified shared in the benefit on the exact same level as the men.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Massachusetts House of Representative submitted questions to the court in regard to proposed legislation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Massachusetts House of Representatives submitted the questions of whether legislation could be enacted which provided that the supreme judicial court could not hear any evidence under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 25, &sect; 5, including cases that involved the confiscation of property, and whether such a bill would be unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 5 governed the appellate review of rulings and orders of the commission for the department of utilities. The court determined that it was proper to prohibit new evidence, except in cases that involved the confiscation of property. Under &sect; 5, pursuant to the Massachusetts Constitution and the United States Constitution, any statute was forbidden, in cases where confiscation or a violation of the Constitution was claimed, that foreclosed the right of a utility to submit those issues to a court for a determination of its own independent judgment as to both the law and the facts. It would be constitutional to require that all evidence first be heard and passed upon by the commission and that the reviewing court hear the case on the transcript of that evidence together with the commission's findings.</SPAN></P>

Is it constitutionally competent for the General Court to provide that any town that has adopted a town manager form of government may make amendments in such form of government providing such amendments do not essentially change the form of government without enabling legislation being enacted by the General Court? The court answered the first question &quot;No,&quot; and requested to be excused from further answering because nothing definite was contained in the second question. Article 30 of the Declaration of Rights provided for the separation of the executive, legislative, and judicial powers in the government of Massachusetts, and Mass. Const. art. 4, &sect; 1, cl. 1 designated the General Court as the repository of the legislative power. The power to prescribe, regulate, and alter the governments of municipalities was one to be exercised by the General Court and it could not be delegated to the towns or to their inhabitants.</SPAN></P>

The proposed statute did not violate the provision against self-incrimination. Nor did the proposed amendment violate the separation of powers doctrine embodied in Mass. Const. Declaration of Rights art. 30. The court expressly noted that it expressed no opinion as to whether the proposed amendment could constitutionally be applied so as to permit the use against the taxpayer of returns filed before the amendment.

The engineer held a hearing and a reopened hearing. The engineer filed his report, and the commission filed its findings, order, and determination. The court rejected the city's contention that the hearings were not conducted as required by 1947 Mass. Acts ch. 544, &sect; 10. While no comprehensive definition of &quot;formal&quot; was called for, the court determined that in the statute in question, where it was grouped with &quot;administrative,&quot; it referred in general to matters of routine or of form as distinguished from matters of substance. There was no reason to suppose that the legislature in this relatively recent enactment intended the department to handle matters relating to the transit authority in a more time consuming manner than theretofore required in the cases of other public utilities in general. The department had authority to grant permits to operate trackless trolleys under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 163, &sect; 6; ch. 161, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The superintendent denied the owner's request to subdivide his property so as to allow him to sell part of it. The owner claimed that because his houses were there before the zoning ordinances preventing its subdivision, the ordinances did not apply. The court held that the owner was not entitled to the subdivision. The ordinances, specifically, Cambridge, Mass., Ordinance art. VI, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, applied because the owner's proposal modified the future use of the property so as to be inconsistent with the ordinances. Specifically, the property frontages would have been too small, and the change in use of the property would have been contrary to the ordinances. Merely because the property was already in non-conformity to the ordinances did not allow the modification for another non-conforming use. The ordinances were not unconstitutional because there was no showing that they were unreasonable, arbitrary, or oppressive merely because the owner was unable to sell the property in the most advantageous manner. The action against the superintendent and inspector was properly dismissed because they lacked the authority to grant permission to subdivide the property for sale purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">At the time that the testator died, Mass Gen.

The trustee paid the taxes before he distributed the funds to the specific legatees but after he distributed the funds to the residuary legatees. 1948 Mass. Acts ch. 605, &sect; 1 changed the law so that the taxes were not to be apportioned. As a result, the specific legatees claimed that the residuary legatees owed them money for the taxes paid from their distributions. The court held that the specific legatees were not entitled to contributions form the residuary legatees. The court reasoned that the application of &sect; 1 after the law changed would have violated Mass. Const. Decl. Rights art. 30 and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Mass Gen.

The court disregarded the Fifth Amendment argument, holding that the Fifth Amendment protected only against conduct of the federal government. As to defendant's argument that ch. 272, &sect; 99 denied him due process and equal protection in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment, the court disagreed, finding that the Legislature had merely exempted persons having written permission to eavesdrop from the Attorney General or a district attorney from the scope of the act. It did not unconstitutionally delegate any power to those officers to determine who was to receive such written permission. Thus, because apart from the reference to the Attorney General and to the district attorneys, defendant did not argue that there was any constitutional defect, the court overruled defendant's exceptions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff Treasurer of the City of Worcester challenged a decision of the Superior Court (Massachusetts), which determined that defendant Commissioner of the Department of Labor and Industries had authority to issue an order regarding employee payroll checks, that the order was valid, and that the treasurer and city were bound to comply with the order. The trial court further dismissed the treasurer's complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The order required a hospital to maintain enough cash on the premises to allow employees to cash payroll checks when received. The trial court dismissed the complaint based on a finding that the treasurer's exclusive remedy was under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &sect; 9. On appeal, the court reversed the order dismissing the complaint, but dismissed the appeal. First, chapter 149, &sect; 9 contained a sentence expressly reserving other lawful remedies. As such, it was not exclusive and did not have to first be exhausted, and the treasurer was free to bring his declaratory judgment action under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, &sect; 148. Accordingly, the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. However, the determination that the treasurer was bound to comply with the order was correct. Chapter 149, &sect; 148 did not authorize the Commissioner to retroactively determine that payment facilities were unreasonable; rather, it authorized the Commissioner to act prospectively by enacting the order applicable to the hospital. Thus, the order was a reasonable exercise of that authority, and it was not arbitrary because it prescribed a reasonable standard of providing services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the trial court's order for a decree dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. In its place, the court ordered a decree declaring that the order was not invalid. The court further dismissed the treasurer's appeal.</SPAN></P>
