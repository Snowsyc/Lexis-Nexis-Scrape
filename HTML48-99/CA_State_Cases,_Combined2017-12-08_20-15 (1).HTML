</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured employee brought an action against his co-employee and employer after being injured in a truck accident caused by the co-employee. Because the accident involved employees of the same company, the trial court dismissed the complaint as within the exclusive remedies of workers' compensation with leave for the injured employee to amend his complaint to show an exception. The injured employee did not amend his complaint, but contended that Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3601(a) was unconstitutional because it limited his right of action against the co-employee to injuries caused by intoxicated, willful, or reckless conduct. The court affirmed the dismissal and the validity of &sect; 3601(a). The court determined that under Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 21, the legislature had the power to enact comprehensive workers' compensation legislation. Because Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3601(a) did not abolish the injured employee's common law cause of action, but only restricted it to certain circumstances, and because workers' compensation bestowed other benefits on the injured employee, the court conclude that &sect; 3601(a) did not exceed the legislature's plenary power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ruled that workers' compensation legislation restricting the injured employee's cause of action against the co-employee to intoxicated, willful, or reckless conduct was not unconstitutional and affirmed the dismissal of the injured employee's complaint against the co-employee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landowners sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which held that a boundary commission properly refused to accept for filing the landowners' two proposals for the incorporation of a new city under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 35002 and that the filings did not prohibit defendant city from proceeding with its proposed annexation of the same land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a dispute over the use of certain land, the landowners sought to incorporate a new city, while the city sought to annex the land. In the landowners' proceeding in mandamus to prevent the annexation and to challenge the boundary commission's refusal to accept the landowners' proposals for incorporation, the trial court found in favor of the city. The court held that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 35002, which provided that after a city located in a county of 4,000,000 or more people filed a petition for annexation of a territory, no other proposal for the annexation or incorporation of that territory could have been filed did not violate Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 25, cl. 28, 33. The court reasoned that while Los Angeles County was the only county in the state large enough for the requirement to apply, there was a rational reason to impose additional procedural restraints for annexation in a county of that size. The court noted that the statute did not single one county out specifically. The court then held that under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 35002, the landowners' filing of two petitions to incorporate were of no effect because they were filed within 45 days of the city's annexation proposal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court denying the landowners' writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three defendants appealed their convictions by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) for robbery and for kidnapping for the purpose of robbery. The charges arose from defendants robbing two cocktail bars.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants went into the bars and made the customers lie down while defendants robbed the bar. One defendant was later arrested with a gun, which he denied was his. The court affirmed defendants' convictions, finding that there was ample evidence to support the verdict. Any inconsistencies in the identifications of defendants as the perpetrators by the prosecution witnesses or uncertainties of witnesses in giving their testimony were matters solely in the first instance for the jury. Here, the jury might reasonably have found that under the stress of events different victims at one of the bars perceived and retained different impressions of the participants in the crimes and of their roles, but the jury nevertheless could still have concluded that all three defendants were involved. In addition, the trial court properly omitted instructions on circumstantial evidence. It was unnecessary because the conviction of each defendant did not depend upon inferences drawn from a pattern of circumstances but rather upon the credibility to be given the testimony of eyewitnesses directly implicating each defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner teachers sought review of the decision from the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which dissolved their writ of mandate and denied their petition for a preemptory writ of mandate under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11523 and Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1094.5 following the revocation of their teaching credentials by respondent California Board of Education.

Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 3100-3109, for having allegedly lied in their loyalty oath. The teachers, who at one time were members of the Communist Party, had asserted under oath that they were not members of any organization that had conspired to overthrow the United States Government. The lower court dissolved an alternative writ of mandate that it had issued to the teachers and denied their request for a preemptory writ of mandate pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11523 and Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1094.5. The court found that the teachers were entitled to reconsideration because it found that the board had improperly taken judicial notice under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11515 that the Communist Party actively sought to overthrow the government. In reaching this decision, the court noted that evidence should be required before the power of judicial notice was employed in any situation where a fact was in doubt.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the appellate court concluded that the complaint failed to allege interference with any practice of any plaintiff. Under the agreement at issue, doctors of osteopathy could continue their practice under the use of the designation &quot;doctor of osteopathy&quot;; none were required to give up such designation nor the practice of osteopathy.</SPAN></P>

There was no direct evidence of the doctor's participation in the events charged in the first five counts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant did not timely file for a new trial or appeal the sentence of probation. However, he later challenged the conviction after the state supreme court ruled that the giving of an instruction based on the statutory presumption of &sect; 496 was improper because the section of the statute stating that anyone receiving stolen property from a minor was presumed to know that the property was stolen was unconstitutional. Defendant contended that he could not have earlier raised the issue because the new law was not in effect. On appeal, the court disagreed. First, the statute was unconstitutional as to &quot;receiving&quot; stolen property, but defendant bought the property. Further, there was direct evidence that defendant knew the property was stolen. Because the time to challenge had passed, defendant's only relief was through coram nobis. Such a writ was extraordinary and was not available where defendant was challenging an irregular jury instruction. Even though defendant did not characterize his motion as one for coram nobis relief, that was the only remedy. Under any other theory, there was no jurisdiction to entertain the motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While incarcerated in a county jail, defendant refused to return to his cell. When two peace officers took steps to put him back in the cell, defendant, who had a razor blade in one hand and a broomstick handle in the other, resisted. One of the officers was cut from the razor blade, and defendant was prosecuted for assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer under &sect; 245(b). On the day of trial, defendant relieved his attorney and insisted on self-representation, and the trial judge spoke with defendant about the advisability of having an attorney and the procedures in handling a trial. Defendant admitted to prior felony convictions. On appeal from defendant's conviction, the court held that: (1) the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by accepting defendant's waiver of counsel because defendant was given considerable opportunity to have counsel, he had an attorney who represented him at all stages of the case up to the day of trial, and he was not unfamiliar with legal proceedings; and (2) &sect; 245(b), which imposed a special punishment for an assault upon a peace officer, did not violate due process because it was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control charged the licensee with selling alcoholic beverages at prices below the applicable fair trade prices. The court rejected the licensee's contention that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act's fair trade provisions were unconstitutional, finding that the fair trade provisions were a valid and constitutional exercise of the police power. The admission of the duly filed fair trade contracts invoked three statutory presumptions under Cal.  Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1963, subds. 15, 19, 33 that the subject alcoholic beverages were in fair and open competition. The court found that a vague offer of proof through the testimony of an importer, rectifier, and wholesaler of distilled spirits that off-brand distilled beverages were not in fair and open competition with other advertised brands was properly rejected because it did not disprove fair and open competition or negate the constitutionality of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act's fair trade provisions. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that the penalty of revocation was not a clear abuse of discretion based on the licensee's deliberate and repeated course of unlawful conduct.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the concept conveyed by the instruction given in the present case was that nothing more than ordinary negligence constituted criminal negligence sufficient to sustain a conviction under the charge of involuntary manslaughter. The court held that this concept was erroneous. Further, the court stated that for conviction of manslaughter, the state had to do more than establish mere coincidence between an act and the fact of death. It had to establish the &quot;causal connection&quot; between the violation and the loss of life. The court held that the trial court's failure to instruct upon the element of proximate causation constituted error. The trial court should have given such an instruction on its own motion. The court reversed the judgment of conviction as to each count with respect to each doctor.</SPAN></P>

The landowner charged the ordinances were unconstitutional and invalid because they were enacted without notice to the landowner. The court affirmed the first judgment because it found the action of the board of supervisors in rejecting the map was proper even if its assigned reason, conflict with the zoning ordinance, was open to challenge. The court did not pass upon the first ordinance because its status was moot. The court noted that adoption of El Dorado County, Cal., Ordinance 482, followed a chronology of steps looking toward the formulation of a countywide water development and conservation plan. Adoption of an ordinance of limited duration and application did not exceed the county's police powers. The court held that the interim zoning ordinance was neither arbitrary nor oppressive, nor was it invalid, for want of notice given before its adoption.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the charter's overall standards guiding the police chief and board in issuing permits to pawnbroker businesses, which affected the health, crime, policing, and welfare of the city, did not offend constitutional requirements that discretionary power be restricted by specific standards. The court held that the pawnbroker erroneously argued that the denial of his application was invalid under San Francisco, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 1279, which was repealed by implication after the adoption of the new charter. The court held that the board gave the pawnbroker due process and exercised its sound discretion in denying the permit after considering substantial evidence, including opinions, that the proposed business would have caused a police problem and downgrading of the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>

Prior to his escape, defendant was disciplined for violating a prison rule. In that proceeding defendant was adjudged guilty and punished by a fine, loss of privileges, and solitary confinement. The Superior Court of Placer County (California) rejected defendant's double jeopardy defense and convicted him of escape. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, that his plea of double jeopardy should not have been stricken, and that he was erroneously and unconstitutionally convicted under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4531 because his status at the camp was similar to that of a parolee. The court affirmed. First, the court held that it was superfluous to say that the testimony supported the judgment. Second, defendant's disciplinary action for violating a prison rule was legally insufficient to support a plea of double jeopardy in defense of a charge of escape. Punishment by the prison authorities for a violation of its rules or for the enforcement of necessary discipline did not place defendant in jeopardy within the constitutional sense and it constituted no defense whatever to a charge of the character for which defendant was tried. Third, &sect; 4531 provided specifically that escape from a prison forestry camp was a felony.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner contended that the ordinance attempted to validate the wearing of a mask or disguise by one who had secured a municipal permit to do so, while the Penal Code contained no licensing provision and prohibited the act regardless of any local permit. The court found that a clear conflict existed between the ordinance and the Penal Code, which arose directly from the language of the enactments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted that Cal. Health and Safety Code &sect; 11500 was unconstitutionally applied because of his addiction to narcotics and his possession of heroin was a product of his addiction or compulsive craving. Inherent in this contention was a distinction between an addict's possession in satisfaction of his compulsive craving and possession for other purposes. The court held that by imprisoning defendant for possession, the state was penalizing his act, not his craving. There was no evidence that he was under the influence of narcotics at the time of his arrest, that he was unconscious, or that he was not fully aware of his surroundings and his actions. Even on the assumption that the condition of a compulsive addict might under some circumstances render the person incapable of crime, there was no evidence of such a condition here. The court found no illegality in defendant's arrest or in the officers' actions, which culminated in the exposure of contraband. Further, the probation report amply supported the trial judge's decision that defendant was not a fit subject for a rehabilitation facility and there was no reason to disturb that decision. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected defendant's claim that trial counsel was ineffective. The court found that defendant was given a vigorous defense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant brought pills into the county jail concealed under her armpit. The pills were tablets that contained phenobarbital and methamphetamine. They were classified as a hypnotic and could not be obtained without a prescription. The trial court dismissed the information charging defendant on the ground that the statute was so vague that one had to guess at its meaning. The court reversed the dismissal, holding that the trial judge erred in finding the statute unconstitutional. Defendant could not attack a statute on grounds that were not applicable to her. The court could not consider the question of constitutionality with reference to hypothetical situations. The substance carried by defendant was a hypnotic drug. The court determined that it was within the types of drugs that the legislature intended to be included in the prohibition of the statute. The legislature was not required to specify each category of drugs within the statute. The court further found that, if the People were required to show that the drug was brought into the jail without authorization for purposes of the motion to set aside the information, only slight proof satisfied the requirement.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court certified the case to resolve the issue of whether constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure applied to unreasonable searches by private persons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A store detective looked under a dressing room partition to watch defendant in the next enclosure, observed her roll up a blouse, and put it in her purse. The detective had no particular reason to suspect defendant and had made many similar arrests. The trial court granted a new trial on the ground that the evidence was illegally obtained and later dismissed the charges due to suppression of the evidence. The court held that the evidence was admissible. The court adhered to the rule that evidence obtained in an unreasonable search and seizure by a private citizen and subsequently delivered to prosecuting authorities was admissible. The court noted that the evidence would not be admissible if acquired by government officers in the same manner. The court also emphasized that the Fourth Amendment restricted only governmental agencies and that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited only &quot;state action,&quot; and the court declined to extend the protections afforded by either constitutional provision to private acts. The retailer did not violate any law when it undertook to protect its legitimate business against thievery, and its interests necessarily outweighed a shoplifter's asserted rights.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the fact that such injury arose out of and in the course of employment did not establish per se that the coemployees who inflicted that injury were acting within the scope of their employment. The phrase &quot;scope of his employment&quot; as used in Cal. Lab.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Attorney General brought suit against petitioners, builders, owners, subdividers, sellers, and promoters of a housing tract, seeking to enjoin them from violating the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 51-52, by selling houses in a manner that unlawfully denied the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, and services of their business establishment on the grounds of race or color. The complaint alleged that petitioners refused to sell or offer to sell any of the houses to African-Americans. After respondent district court granted the preliminary injunction sought by the Attorney General, petitioners filed this action seeking a writ of prohibition. The issue was whether the Attorney General, on behalf of the State of California, had authority to maintain a civil action to restrain petitioners' business activities. The court held that the Attorney General had broad common law authority to do so in the absence of legislative restriction, analogizing to California Supreme Court cases holding that the Attorney General could enforce statutes enacted to safeguard the public such as the Unfair Practices Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 17000-17101.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the petition for a writ of prohibition sought by petitioners, builders, owners, subdividers, sellers, and promoters of a housing tract. The court also discharged the alternative writ of prohibition. In view of other California Supreme Court cases involving situations substantially analogous to the present case, the court sustained the contention of the Attorney General relative to maintaining the action against petitioners.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the appeal from the denial of the motion for a new trial because it was a non-appealable order. The court modified the denial of the motion to retax costs, finding that the employee should only have been charged $ 7.50 instead of $ 12.50 for filing fees.

The police found three marijuana cigarettes on defendant, a bottle of narcotics under the driver's seat of his vehicle that was parked across the street, and heroin and drug paraphernalia in a locker that was located at a bus terminal. The trial court granted the dismissal on the ground that the only evidence had been seized illegally. The People argued that defendant was lawfully arrested for visiting a place where defendant knew that narcotics were being smoked or used in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11556. On appeal, the court found that the warrantless search of the locker, which was distant from the place of arrest and contemporaneous with defendant's arrest, was not a search incident to defendant's arrest. Additionally, defendant did not visit a place where narcotics were being used because narcotics were not being used when he arrived at the apartment. Section 11556 referred to actions taking place inside the apartment, not to a standing condition of the apartment. Thus, the arrest was unlawful, and the subsequent searches were also unlawful.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the city acted in a field clearly within its police power, and fixed projection limits that it deemed reasonable. The court held that the merchants failed to prove their burden of showing that the classification was unreasonable, in light of the presumption favoring the city's determination, the lack of evidence of engineering or planning experts, and in their reliance upon the lay opinions of other owners of signs violating the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that the franchise tax board's apportionment formula did not impermissibly derive from extraterritorial sources. The court noted that there was nothing unconstitutional about the fact that an apportionment formula necessarily took into account income which was earned outside it borders. The court explained that in order for an apportionment formula to be valid, it was required to be based upon one or a combination of logically relevant factors. The court found that the franchise tax board's port day formula reasonably proportioned the forum state's contributed values by acknowledging the productive value supplied to the entire voyage of a vessel.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was awarded compensation for his silicosis occupational injury. The insurer argued that the award required it to bear the burden of the entire compensation payable to the employee, even though the insured was only the last of series of employers. On appeal, the court affirmed the award. The court held that Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 5500.5's provision providing that any selected employer or employers contributing to the disability of the silicosis victim must bear the burden of the entire award with only the limited right of reimbursement retained and without recourse to public funds to effect complete reimbursement, was a valid exercise of police power. The court reasoned that the legislature foresaw the possibility of insolvency of an employer liable for contribution and had forestalled frustration of contribution on by requiring self-insured employers to deposit a bond or securities in an amount fixed by the Director of Industrial Relations. Thus, the court concluded that the problem of reimbursement was narrowed and left inaccessible only insolvent insurers and employers beyond the jurisdiction of the commission.</SPAN></P>

A hearing officer determined that the allegations were true and recommended revocation of his liquor license, which the ABC director adopted. The ABC Appeals Board affirmed the decision. The bar owner sought a writ of mandamus from the superior court to set aside the ABC's decision. The superior court affirmed the decision as to Count I and reversed as to Count II because &sect; 24200(e) was previously declared unconstitutional. The bar owner appealed.

It held that an earlier ruling by the California Supreme Court that the MWDA was constitutional was binding on the court and that even if there were doubts as to constitutionality, the passage of time as well as the fact that 48 municipal water districts had been organized in the interim required affirmance of the judgment of constitutionality. The court found that (1) the legislature was fully empowered by general law to establish such a district, which was quasi-municipal in nature, for the purpose of supplying general municipal needs; (2) the nature of the powers granted to those districts was a political question to be determined by the state; and (3) the constitution did not limit the legislature's power in determining what property would be included within municipal territory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was injured in an industrial accident, which accelerated an existing diabetic retinitis to produce blindness in his right eye. Prior to the injury, he had already suffered the complete loss of vision in his left eye. He filed for benefits from the Fund. At his hearing evidence was presented that he received federal social security disability benefits for his preexisting condition and the subsequent injury. The employee was found to be 100 percent disabled. His employer's carrier was responsible for a part of the award, and the remainder of it was issued against the Fund. The Fund received a credit under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 4753 for the employee's social security disability payments. The employee filed for reconsideration and the Commission vacated the Fund's credit. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that social security disability payments were not within any of the exceptions in &sect; 4753, so the employee was not entitled to a double recovery for the same disabilities. The court held that since the social security disability payments were in part accountable to the preexisting liability for which the Fund was liable the credit had to be allowed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that under its police powers the city had full power to adopt the rubbish collection ordinance under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 6, 8, 11 and Los Angeles City Charter, &sect; 2(4), (6), (9), (11)b and &sect; 3(14). The court determined that the allegations that the ordinance was invalid because it was intended for the financial benefit of a private corporation and was intended solely as a revue measure were without legal effect because the motivation of the city in passing the ordinance was irrelevant to the inquiry concerning its reasonableness. The court also held that the taxpayer did not have standing to assert unconstitutional discrimination against hotels and motels because he was not within the allegedly discriminated against class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband argued that the trial court erred in granting his wife a divorce because it failed to give full faith and credit to the prior ex-parte Nevada divorce that he had obtained against his wife. He also contended that the trial court abused its discretion in its award of the community property to the respective parties and that his wife was awarded a disproportionate share of the property. In affirming the decree and the division of the property, the court held that a divorce decree was not entitled to full faith and credit where neither party had a domicile in the divorce state, and the attacking party was not served within the jurisdiction and did not appear in the action. The court found that the husband never had a domicile in Nevada when he filed for divorce in that state, and that his wife did not participate in that action. The court stated that the unequal division of property was warranted because where a divorce was granted on the ground of extreme cruelty, the nonoffending party was entitled to be awarded more than one-half of the community property. The wife was granted a divorce on the ground of extreme cruelty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The questions for the court were whether inclusion of the words &quot;educational, scientific, or literary purposes&quot; in the business' charter disqualified it for the welfare exemption and whether Cal.

However, the past and present uses of the business' property had been fully charitable and the problem grew out of the declaration of purposes found in the charter. The court concluded that the articles of incorporation could not be condemned on the ground of nonexempt purposes and that there was no need to amend them. The business was entitled to the welfare exemption for the years in question. The plain meaning of the statutory provisions appeared to be that, while there was no time limit upon the right to cancellation, a refund could be had only after presentation of a proper claim showing a right thereto which had to be filed within three years after payment of the sum sought to be refunded and subject to the further condition that suit must be brought within six months after such rejection.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance merely limited the business of outdoor advertising, as it limited other businesses, to specified districts. The advertisers' signs were made pursuant to the conduct of the business of outdoor advertising itself, and did not relate to the structure housing a business like an ordinary business sign. The court held that the unique nature of outdoor advertising and the nuisances fostered by billboards and similar outdoor structures justified the separate classification of such structures for the purposes of governmental regulation and restriction.</SPAN></P>

The superior court held that the use tax applied to the carrier's stored replacement engines and propellers did not violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution or Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that the engines and propellers were purchased for storage and use in California, that the property was stored and used in California, and that the personal property had come to rest in California prior to its installation into aircraft within the meaning of the Cal.

The court held that the use tax was a complement to the state sales tax and had been formerly adjudicated a constitutional revenue-raising measure for the state. The court rejected the carrier's assertion that the state use tax could not apply because the engines and propellers were primarily consumed in interstate commerce. The court affirmed that it was adequate that the engines and propellers were purchased and brought into the state for the purpose of installation in aircraft located in the state. The court affirmed that imposition of the use tax was not an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce and that the board's previous adjudications under &sect; 6352 were consistent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The arrestee brought a charge of false imprisonment against several individuals and the city and county after he spent several days in jail upon his failure to post bail on a warrant of attachment.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the arrestee had failed to allege facts constituting the invalidity of the legal process that constituted a false imprisonment. The allegation that the warrant was void, illegal, unauthorized, or that the sheriff unlawfully imprisoned the arrestee were conclusions of law. Furthermore, the court found that the warrant of attachment was regular on its face, and that the endorsement of the judge's order, which did not provide for surety bonds, was the order of the judge, and was in accordance with Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Initially, the court noted that an appeal could not have been taken from the peremptory writ of mandate, and therefore, it dismissed the appeal from the writ.

The court held that (1) the department's decision to suspend the license was supported by substantial evidence, (2) there was no prejudicial abuse of discretion, and (3) the department proceeded in the manner required by law. Accordingly, the court found that the findings and conclusions of the trial court to the contrary were erroneous. Specifically, the court held that the fair trade agreements in question conformed to the statutory requirements of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 23000-25762, were supported by consideration, and were valid and enforceable. Additionally, the court found substantial evidence that the alcoholic beverages covered by the agreements were in fair and open competition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant landowner sought review of an order from the Superior Court of Colusa County (California), which held: (1) that an ordinance requiring a permit for the leveling of land was constitutional; (2) that a county permit was required without regard to interferences with the drainage rights of neighboring owners; and (3) that upon application, an injunction would issue to restrain the landowner from land leveling without a permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff county adopted an ordinance requiring a permit for the leveling of land having an area greater than five acres. The landowner refused to comply with the ordinance. The parties sought a judicial declaration which, in advance of actual conduct, would determine whether or not that conduct would render a citizen amenable to criminal punishment under a county ordinance, which he asserted to be unconstitutional. Because of the interest, which the landowner alleged in future leveling of his property, and because the ordinance affected a substantial segment of the economy in the county, it was appropriate for the court to pass upon the ordinance. The court determined that the standards, which guided the road commissioner in granting or denying permits, were sufficiently definite. The ordinance did not violate constitutional inhibitions against unlimited delegations of authority. The court held that the exemption of small parcels was not &quot;palpably arbitrary.&quot; Finally, if the county desired to provide property owners with advance protection against harm, the court could not say that its action was outside the broad police powers reposed in the county by Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

The patrolman was injured when defendant, while intoxicated, negligently drove his vehicle into the patrol car driven by the state employee. The trial court granted judgment in favor of plaintiff in the amount prayed for, the sum of $ 5,166.78, which sum represented the amount paid the patrolman before a determination was made that his injury was industrially incurred. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that plaintiff's action was not time-barred, and that defendant was not prejudiced by the fact that he was not a party to the Industrial Accident Commission proceeding. The court further held that providing plaintiff a subrogation right to proceed against defendant did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, because the classification of state employees as different from employees in private business was not arbitrary, but rather had a substantial relation to the purpose for which the legislation was designed.</SPAN></P>

The People prevailed in an action seeking forfeiture of the car, and the registered co-owners, the driver's parents, appealed. The court held that the search and seizure was legal because the officers were under a duty to stop to investigate smoking in a fire area. Thereafter, the odor of marijuana, coupled with the passenger's furtive movements, was sufficient to arouse the police officer's suspicion and to justify the subsequent search. It was irrelevant whether the registered owners knew that the car was used for an illegal purpose because they had given their daughter permission to use the vehicle. The forfeiture laws were not unconstitutional because they distinguished between registered owners and legal owners of vehicles as the powers and duties of the two were different.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants filed a writ of mandate to compel respondent Commissioner of Insurance to reinstate appellants' license to sell insurance, after respondent suspended appellants' license for misrepresentation in advertising and in financing insurance premiums in a manner constituting loans of money at usurious interest rates. The trial court entered judgment for respondent, and appellants sought review. On appeal, the court held that the finding that appellants engaged in misleading advertising was supported by substantial evidence. In so holding, the court stated that appellants sent solicitation letters to individuals that just had their license suspended and the letters misrepresented the nature of the premium charged for insurance since the purpose of the transaction was to finance insurance premiums. Further, the court held that the trial court's failure to make specific findings requested by appellants was not an error. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment for respondent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Grandchild appealed a judgment holding that she was not an heir to her deceased paternal grandmother's estate owing to her adoption by her stepfather. The court affirmed. The grandchild's mother had divorced her natural father, who was the child of the deceased paternal grandmother and later remarried. Thereafter, the grandchild was adopted by her mother's new husband, her stepfather. When her natural father's mother died intestate, the grandchild sought to be deemed an heir. The trial judge rejected this effort, ruling that the grandchild's adoption by her stepfather extinguished her right to intestate succession from her natural father's ancestors. On appeal, the court held that this was a correct interpretation of the state Probate Code's provision dealing with adoptions. The judgment below was therefore affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) a privilege tax measured by gross product consumed was a valid exercise of the State's taxing power; (2) goods imported by manufacturers for use in their manufacturing processes lost their tax exempt status as &quot;imports&quot; when they had been committed to, and were essential to, their current operational needs; and (3) a tax upon a processing and canning business could be validly levied, and the amount thereof computed by measuring the materials that were received at the processing plants and that, because of their very nature, were immediately put to the very use for which they were imported.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, an inquiry into the curricula was irrelevant. The scope of the term &quot;chiropractic&quot; was limited to the understanding and definition of the term in 1922, when the CIA was enacted. The possession of a chiropractic license was not a defense to a violation of the MPA. Any regulation purporting to enlarge the scope of the CIA was invalid.  Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The children as executors considered that gifts that were made to them by the deceased were made in contemplation of death and thus reported them as such in their California inheritance tax affidavit and federal estate tax return, which subjected them to the California death tax as well.

The executor objected on the ground that the application of &sect; 13441 increased their aggregate federal and state death taxes, therefore they should have been able to pay the amount of the additional state tax to the Federal Government. The court held that the word &quot;allowed&quot; in &sect; 13441 meant &quot;allowable,&quot; therefore all the controller had done by his additional assessment was impose a tax to which the state was rightfully entitled.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee quarry sought review of a decision by the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which sustained appellee county's objection to the introduction of evidence on whether a county zoning ordinance was valid and which denied the quarry's application for a writ of mandate directing the county to approve its application for a permit to operate a rock crushing and processing plant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The quarry sought a use permit in order to operate a rock crushing and processing plant. The planning commission recommended approval of the permit, but the county's board of supervisors denied the permit after a hearing de novo. The quarry brought an action against the county on two bases: 1) that the ordinance that permitted the board to hold a hearing de novo and make its own recommendation was invalid; and 2) that the board abused its discretion in denying the permit. The trial court sustained the county's objections to taking evidence on the first issue and decided that the board had not abused its discretion when it denied the permit. The quarry sought review, and the court affirmed, as modified. The court held that that first question could not have been decided in the same action as the second. However, the court said, the trial court's order sounded as if the quarry could never have challenged the ordinance's validity. Therefore, the court modified the order to state that the validity of the ordinance could not have been challenged until after the quarry had exhausted its other remedies. As to the denial of the permit, the court found that the record supported the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified and affirmed a judgment that upheld the county's objections to evidence of whether the county's zoning ordinance was valid. The court also affirmed an order that denied the quarry's application for a writ of mandate to compel the county to approve its application for a permit to operate a rock crushing and processing plant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the board of directors adopted an ordinance to include the additional property in the district, the owners filed a petition for referendum of the ordinance; the petition did not include signatures of registered voters who lived within the district. On appeal from the superior court's denial of mandamus relief, the owners contended that the California Water Code was to be construed as providing registered voters in an area sought to be included with a right of referendum and that unless so construed, the Code would be discriminatory and unconstitutional. The court held that the unambiguous provisions of Cal. Water Code &sect;&sect; 32400, 32402, 32406, 32447, 32448 applied to the ordinance passed by the board of directors and clearly vested a right of referendum only in the voters and electors of the district itself. The voters, such as the owners, residing in the land sought to be included had no such right of referendum for the obvious reason that they were not electors of the district. The court also found that the classification in the statutes was not unconstitutional because it was reasonable; electors in the district bore the greatest burden of expense involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city chose to participate in a countywide housing development plan rather than establish a separate city housing authority. The city council adopted a resolution conforming to the requirements of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 34209 to join the countywide plan. The city was required to execute a cooperation agreement with the county housing authority, as well, but the chairman refused. The county housing authority filed a petition for a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the chairman to execute the cooperation agreement. The chairman filed a demurrer, which was overruled. The superior court issued the writ. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that Cal. Const. art. XXXIV, &sect; 1 gave the city the alternative of proceeding separately or as part of the countywide housing development plan. Following the city's resolution, the plan was approved in a valid countywide election. The court held that the city's voters had sufficient notice of the housing plan that was at issue because it was publicized in newspaper articles, at public meetings, at club meetings, at a booth at the county fair, by the distribution of literature, by a 250-person committee, and by an opposition committee.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the superintendent's actions, and found the statutes were unconstitutional. The superintendent appealed. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because the legislation did not have a reasonable or substantial reason for the discrimination against defendants' businesses as opposed to the types of businesses that were allowed licenses. Such distinctions were unreasonable and arbitrary and a violation of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, the privileges and immunities clause.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, he argued that there was no reasonable basis for the distinction made between registered owners and lienholders in Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;&sect; 11621-11622. Affirming the judgment, the court held that the distinction made between registered owners and lienholders was not arbitrary or unreasonable and that it was reasonably and substantially related to the legitimate purposes of the legislation, which was the suppression of illegal narcotics traffic. It was reasonable to assume that registered owners had more direct control over the use of their motor vehicles than lienholders had.

He followed them to a hotel. The officer noted from the fire escape that the window to their room was closed.

He discovered a needle and syringe in an empty cigarette package just outside the window. The officer searched the room and found a marijuana cigarette in defendant's coat pocket. Defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana with a prior conviction of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11500. He filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the officer's suspicions were reasonable. He did not have sufficient evidence as he stood outside of the hotel room to make an arrest, but he did have grounds to make a further inquiry. The woman's actions supported the inference that she consented to the officer entering the room and once the officer found the narcotic kit outside the window there was probable cause to search the entire room.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant state controller appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which held that plaintiff, a judge's widow, was entitled to a writ of mandate which retroactively granted her an increase in her widow's pension benefits. The widow cross-appealed the superior court's denial of interest on the judgment that was awarded to her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The widow's husband died in 1954. The widow received all of the benefits that she was entitled to at that time, which consisted of a lump-sum payment. The law pertaining to widows of judges was thereafter amended, and Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 75104.4 provided that the widow was entitled to one-half of the pension that her husband would have received. The controller contended that the retroactive legislation violated Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 31, 32. The lower court granted a writ of mandate and held that the widow was entitled to the pension, but she was not entitled to interest on her pension payments. The court affirmed, holding that even though the widow had received a lump-sum payment that paid her all the pension monies that were due her at the time, the retroactive increase in her pension rights was not an unconstitutional gift because her pensionable status had continued even after she received the lump-sum distribution. Because Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3287 did not apply to public retirement funds, the court ruled that the widow was not entitled to interest on the additional pension funds that she was entitled to receive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, which granted the widow of a writ of mandate requiring the controller to retroactively pay her increased widow's benefits and which denied the widow interest on the judgment which she received.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff irrigation district (district) appealed from a declaratory judgment of the Superior Court of Stanislaus County (California), which held valid a ordinance of respondent city, regulating the location of overhead utilities. The trial court denied an injunction to permanently enjoin the city from enforcing the ordinance, which was enacted pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 11500 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district was engaged in the business of transmitting, distributing, and selling electric power. A city ordinance required the location of overhead utilities on lot easements rather than along city streets. The district contended that the ordinance was invalid because the state had exclusive jurisdiction over the franchise of power lines in cities. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of a declaratory judgment for the city. The ordinance was not in conflict with any state statute. It was enacted pursuant to an express delegation of authority under Calif. Water Code &sect; 22476. The only restriction imposed by the state was that any condition imposed by a city had to be reasonable. The court construed &sect; 22476 with reference to the Subdivision Map Act. The ordinance did not exceed the power delegated to the city. It did not prohibit the use of streets by the district and included four specific exceptions to compliance with it, as well as one exception for other good and sufficient reasons. The mere showing that the maintenance of power lines along easements was more burdensome or more expensive did not, ipso facto, make the restrictions unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a declaratory judgment action brought by the district, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which upheld the validity of the city's ordinance regulating overhead utilities.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the prosecution needed to show that he intended to do an unlawful act. The court held that the error was harmless because it was obvious the jury did not believe the testimony of defendant in reference to any feigned or simulated kidnapping of the victim. The court determined no prejudicial error resulted from the trial judge's remarks pertaining to what factors the jury could consider in deciding whether defendant was telling the truth where the remarks were a fair and logical statement of the facts. The court concluded comments made by the trial judge in no way led the jury to believe defendant had the burden of proving his innocence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state charged use taxes against a bank on the ground that the bank was required to collect the taxes from its depositors who had purchased personalized checks, and having failed to do so became liable for the payment of the taxes and interest thereon from its own funds. The bank contested liability for the taxes, paid the taxes and interest under protest, filed a written claim for refund, and upon rejection of the claim filed an action for recovery of the amount paid, with interest. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the state. On appeal, the court affirmed. Specifically, the court held that the bank was a retailer in accordance with Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 6203, that a retailer who failed to collect the use tax was liable to the state for the tax pursuant to &sect; 6203-6204, that a retailer's liability was one of a debt and not of the tax itself, and that imposition of such a liability on the bank was no more of an interference with its functions as a national bank than any other legal proceeding to which it might be subjected.</SPAN></P>

The provisions of the Hawkins Act, Cal.

The court found that Cal. Agric.

The court noted that the statute specifically provided that the credit for the return of the container must be in excess of the minimum price.

Corp. Code &sect; 25000 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The information alleged that petitioner had violated Cal. Corp. Code &sect;&sect; 26104(a), 25500, and 25152. Petitioner contended that the evidence at the preliminary hearing was insufficient to justify petitioner's being held to answer because the securities laws did not make it a crime for an individual to sell corporate securities which he owned for the benefit of the corporation and that if &sect; 25152 were so construed, it would be unconstitutional. The court disagreed and denied the writ. The court held that the evidence at the preliminary hearing presented a clear picture that petitioner acted as a promoter soliciting and obtaining money from four individuals upon representations that they were to receive his personal shares, when, in fact, the corporate shares had not been issued and when the application before the California Corporation Commissioner for their issuance had been removed and was later abandoned. Such activity clearly constituted a criminal violation of the securities laws. In addition, &sect; 25152 was not unconstitutional because &sect; 25152, when read in conjunction with &sect; 26104(a), made it clear that the actions of the petitioner constituted a public offense.</SPAN></P>

When the association sought to sell dairy products to the federal government at certain military bases in California below the minimum prices established pursuant to the Act, the director filed an action seeking a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction. After a hearing solely on the application for preliminary injunction, and in the absence of any pleadings responsive to the complaint, motions for summary judgment, or stipulation that the merits of the case should have been determined at that stage, the trial court sua sponte issued a final decree dismissing the underlying action on a theory of lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the action. The court held that since the sole matter before the trial court was the preliminary injunction application, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to reach the merits of the underlying action, and therefore the dismissal of the action was error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant transported cattle from Utah to California. Once the rail car reached its destination, the cattle were left in the rail car without food and water. The consignee had not yet accepted delivery and defendant still had charge and custody of the cattle. The State charged defendant with unlawfully failing to provide food and water for the cattle. Defendant filed a demurrer to the charge, which the justice court sustain on the basis that the charge was preempted by the Cruelty to Animals Act, 45 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 71-74. The superior court affirmed that decision and the State sought review. The court affirmed, finding that whether federal law superseded state law in this instance depended on whether the cattle were still in interstate commerce. The court held that they were. The court noted that an interstate shipment was not complete until there was complete delivery to the consignee and surrender of dominion and control over the property by defendant. Because the cattle were still in the rail car and had not been delivered to the consignee, they were still in interstate commerce. The court further held that the federal act precluded the application of state law to defendant.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that there was ample evidence in the record to support the judgment. The court held that the three exhibits in question were admitted during the prosecution's case in chief for the purpose of proving the two prior convictions which defendant previously denied. The court stated that the trial court carefully explained the matter of the prior convictions to defendant, who persisted in stating his reasons for the denial of the priors and in arguing with the trial court about the admissibility of the evidence. As defendant chose to be his own attorney, the court held that he should have been prepared to be treated as having the qualifications and responsibilities concomitant with the burden he undertook.</SPAN></P>

The court also ruled that the builders had no standing to object to the application of &sect; 2(n) because the builders were required to invoke and exhaust their administrative remedies before seeking redress in the courts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The residents filed a complaint for declaratory relief challenging the constitutionality of provisions of the California Redevelopment Law.

The complaint challenging the ordinance was filed within 60 days after the ordinance was adopted, as required by Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 33746. The city filed an answer alleging that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. In sustaining the city's demurrer to the complaint, the superior court calculated the time within which the action should have been brought from the date that the city council voted in adopting the ordinance, as opposed to the ordinance's effective date. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the word &quot;adoption&quot; in &sect; 33746 applied to the city's decision to adopt the ordinance, and not to the effective date of the ordinance. Since an action had to be brought within 60 days after the date of adoption and since the date of adoption was the date the ordinance was acted upon, the residents' action was not timely filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a minor asked defendant for a fix, defendant allegedly injected heroin in the minor's arm. Defendant was convicted of unlawfully, furnishing, giving, and administering a narcotic other than marijuana to a minor under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11502. After the trial court denied his motion for a new trial, defendant appealed. On review, the court held that &sect; 11502 was not unconstitutionally vague where it did not define the word minor. The court further held that there was sufficient evidence to show that the minor was injected with a narcotic. The evidence submitted was that the minor requested a fix. The jury was justified in believing that defendant did furnish the minor with a narcotic and that it was heroin. The court concluded that the narcotic content of a substance could be proved by circumstantial evidence. Finally, the court held that the prosecution's use of the transcript of the minor's preliminary examination testimony was to refresh his recollection and was not an attempt to impeach the minor's trial testimony.</SPAN></P>

The court further explained that the ordinance allowed the city to assess a property owner for the costs of abatement, in the event the property owner failed to comply with the directive of the ordinance. &sect;&sect; 32.09 - 32.09. The court held that the purpose of the ordinance was the promotion of the health, safety, and welfare of the inhabitants of the city and, as such, fell within the city's police powers. The court found that the provisions of the ordinance bore a reasonable and substantial relation to its object. Moreover, the court held that the notice provisions of the ordinance satisfied the requirements of due process.

The county's assessor was aware of the taxpayer's method of valuing its inventory when the assessor valued the taxpayer's airplane inventory. Because the airplanes in the inventory were constructed later in the building cycle, the standard costing accounting method attributed higher costs to the airplanes than those which were actually incurred. The taxpayer did not contest the assessor's valuation by appealing to the board of equalization. The lower court held that the taxpayer was entitled to a refund, and the court reversed. The court held that the taxpayer had not been assessed for nonexistent property. Rather, the court found that because the assessor was aware that the assessment he placed on the airplanes was not based upon actual costs, but was based upon estimated costs, the taxpayer's dispute with the county was a valuation issue. Therefore, the taxpayer was required to appeal to the board of equalization and exhaust its administrative remedies before it could challenge the assessment.</SPAN></P>

The Department found that the licensees had violated &sect; 70, but the board reversed. The Department then sought a writ of mandamus against the Board, but the trial court denied the writ. The court affirmed. The court held that the &quot;off-limits&quot; signs were akin to a badge of disrepute by which second-class status could, by official action be attached to a licensee who had never been determined in any proceeding to be guilty of any wrongdoing. There was nothing in the legislative scheme embodied in the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, or the powers vested in the Department by the California Constitution, which sanctioned the classification of licensees as the Department attempted to do in the cases under review. The means used to enforce the objective were clearly improper because they penalized a licensee by a method neither recognized by the Constitution or by statute.</SPAN></P>

The board revoked his license, pursuant to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 2360, 2361, 2383, after his conviction for statutory rape of a patient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The hearing officer had made a recommendation to the Board members, who then voted based on that recommendation without a personal review of the entire record. On appeal, the court held that the decision to revoke the license was supported by substantial evidence. Although the language of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 261.1 criminalizing statutory rape was necessarily broad in scope, and statutory rape did not, per se, involve moral turpitude, the court found that the circumstances of the doctor's offense did indicate moral turpitude and that the Board's accusation had been specific enough to give the doctor notice of the charge. The court held that the Board members were permitted, under Cal. Gov. Code &sect; 11517(b), to vote based on the hearing officer's recommendation and that this procedure did not deny the doctor due process. The court stated that it would presume that the hearing officer had reviewed all the evidence, including the transcript of the doctor's trial, in the absence of substantial grounds indicating otherwise. The court noted that the accusation's mistaken listing of the patient's age as 15 rather than 16 was not critical, since 16 was still well below the statutory age of 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the superior court's judgment, which had affirmed the Board's decision and order revoking the doctor's license to practice medicine.</SPAN></P>

The trial court refused to consider the tenant's affirmative defenses of racial discrimination under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, or the Unruh Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 51, 52.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A landlord proceeded to evict a tenant, who claimed that the only motivation for the action was the tenant's race. The court on appeal found that the tenant raised no counterclaims or questions of title, which would have been properly barred, but raised a fundamental equitable concern under the Fourteenth Amendment and its California counterpart. The court noted that, although the alleged discriminatory action was private, any enforcement by the courts of such an eviction would constitute state action and, as such, would be prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment. The court further noted that the landlord was operating a &quot;business&quot; under the Unruh Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 51, 52, but was not clearly operating a &quot;business establishment&quot; such that the act's prohibitions against private discrimination would apply. Consequently, the court found that a new trial would be necessary where those issues could be considered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment in favor of the landlord and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendants charged the company for services, improvements and materials from which only defendants benefited. On appeal, the court ruled that the evidence showed that the jury was warranted in finding that a conspiracy existed among defendants to cheat and defraud the company. The court ruled that the crime of conspiracy was properly proved by circumstantial evidence. The court rejected defendants' assertion that they were convicted based on the uncorroborated testimony of accomplices. The court noted that the accomplices' testimony was corroborated by company records and information from suppliers who had furnished the various improvements and materials.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff state and defendant farm sought review of judgments of the Superior Court of Fresno County (California), which entered judgments for the state, on the ground of nonexhaustion, in actions to collect unpaid portions of assessments made on the farm as a cantaloupe grower under the California Marketing Act of 1937 (Act), Cal. Agric. Code &sect;&sect; 1300-10 to 1300-30, civil penalties, and court and collection costs, and for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The farm claimed, and the trial court found, that sales promotional materials under the marketing order contained false advertising. The farm argued on appeal that the nonexhaustion doctrine was not applicable, and that the findings did not support the judgment. The state contended that the trial court erred in failing to issue a prohibitory injunction and in refusing to allow collection costs. The court determined that the farm was required to exhaust its administrative remedy before seeking judicial relief. The court concluded that the provision for a mandatory injunction to compel compliance with an assessment levied for the purpose of carrying out and enforcing the Act was a reasonable exercise of the police power, and held that the trial court did not err in failing to also impose a prohibitory injunction because it could have concluded that the necessity for such was past. The court did not think the findings contradictory, and determined that the finding on advertising was surplusage. The court concluded that the collection costs in dispute were not a proper item of recovery in an action brought by the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The division of property that accompanied the parties' divorce was unclear as to whether the wife was to get a sum certain when the husband merely sold his auto wrecking business or whether the wife was entitled to be paid when the husband sold both the business and the land upon which the business was operated. The husband sold essentially all of the stock of his business, but he did not sell the land. During a previous trial, the judge had stated that he would review the record to determine whether the husband should be reported to the district attorney for perjury. The lower court found that the wife was entitled to the sum certain, and the judge refused to disqualify himself. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The court held that because the husband's business was located on so many lots, there was substantial evidence to support the lower court's finding that the wife was entitled to the sum certain upon the husband's sale of his inventory. The court ruled that the judge was not subject to disqualification because the judge had only stated that he would review the record.</SPAN></P>

The record also did not indicated that defendant objected to the admissibility of this evidence upon the grounds that it was obtained as the result of an illegal search. Defendant also contended that there was no evidence that he and his brother agreed to prepare lewd and obscene photographs, which led to the charge of conspiracy. The court noted that a conspiracy was usually proven only be circumstantial evidence and it was not necessary to prove an actual agreement to work together to perform the unlawful acts charged. The only proof available could have resulted from actions of the parties, which manifested an intent to carry out a common purpose to violate the law. Furthermore, it was sufficient that only one of the conspirators accomplished the overt act.</SPAN></P>

The section did not violate the constitutional prohibition against the impairing of liens because the requirement notice was a procedural matter. Such a requirement affected only the manner in which the right was to be enforced. The legislature did not act arbitrarily and unreasonably in making the classification in the statute between: (1) those who were either under direct contract with the owner or performing actual labor for wages; and (2) all others.

The town contended that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter relating to the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance because the landowner had not exhausted his administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner's property was in an area zoned for general business purposes. The town repeatedly turned down his request for a building permit because he refused to dedicate the front of his lot to the town for street purposes, pursuant to Westminster City Code &sect; 8200.20(C).26. Rather than seeking a variance provided by that law, the landowner filed an action for writ of mandate and for declaratory relief, contending that the ordinance was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's award of a peremptory writ because the landowner was precluded from seeking judicial relief until he had exhausted his administrative remedies. The court held that rule in California was that the trial court had no jurisdiction to entertain an action for judicial relief until completion of the available administrative procedure. The rule applied even when the administrative rule was challenged on constitutional grounds and even if the action was for declaratory relief. Once the landowner had exhausted his administrative remedies by seeking a variance and following that process through the administrative remedies provided, he could challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The absence of a requirement for notice and a hearing did not violate due process because such was given in the proceedings, which resulted in the prisoner's original trial. The prisoner's petition failed to allege any facts disclosing that the Authority abused its discretion in its actions.

On appeal, the court said that equitable relief under the statute was not circumscribed by any prerequisite showing that the conduct was limited to business competition. The terms of the statute showed a legislative intent to be inclusive rather than restrictive in practices to be enjoined. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because the trial court neither abused nor exceeded its discretion in determining the type of relief necessary under the facts as found to exist.

Ct. 26, and requested reimbursement for the cost of printing its appellate brief. The customer appealed from the superior court's denial of the motion to eliminate that cost. The court held that the telephone company, the prevailing party, was entitled to the reasonable cost of printing or reproduction of briefs under Rule 26. The fact that the document could have been printed less expensively was not controlling; the rule required only that the telephone company incur the cost and that the cost be deemed reasonable. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the superior court determination regarding the reasonableness of the cost of printing the appellate brief.

A number of pensioners also filed appeals of the trial court's decision in their cases. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the charter amendments were unconstitutional and the trial court's decision regarding determination of pension rights and recovery of unpaid benefits. However, the appellate court did find that the City was not equitably estopped from limiting recovery of unpaid benefits to a period of six-months prior to pensioners' filing of their complaints. The appellate court further found that charter amendments that altered the benefits of pensioners to their detriment without any corresponding benefit were unconstitutional, including provisions aimed at altering the eligibility of widows of pensioners to receive benefits.</SPAN></P>

The court held that pensions were not a trust and that the city pension fund, unlike an ordinary trust, could never be permanently exhausted and thus terminated. The court held that amendments to the city charter did not create fluctuating pensions to which all plaintiffs were entitled. The court affirmed the trial court's formula for computing fixed pensions. The court held that if by application of the formula a benefit resulted to a plaintiff then such benefit should be accorded to the plaintiff, but if it results in a detriment then the formula may not be applied to such plaintiff. The court held that the trial court erred in entering judgment solely against the commissioners because the obligation to pay pensions was an obligation imposed by law upon the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, retired fire and police department pensioners and widows of the pensioners, brought an action against defendants, a city and its board of pension commissioners, to determine pension rights. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) held that a 1925 amendment was unconstitutional, that each widow was entitled to receive a fluctuating pension, and that defendants were estopped to urge defense of the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The principal issue involved in all three cases was whether a July 1, 1925, amendment to the city charter relating to eligibility for widows' pensions, which provided that in order to be eligible for a pension a widow had to have been married to her deceased pensioner husband at least one year prior to the date of his retirement instead of for one year prior to the date of his death as had been provided in the charter prior to 1925. Defendants contended that the 1925 modification of the eligibility provisions of the city charter was not unreasonable as to any member or widow. The court held that the widows who had not successfully established status as pensioners within three years from the date their causes of action accrued (the dates of death of their husbands) were barred from asserting such claims by the statute of limitations. In one case, a widow and her deceased husband were not in a position to challenge the constitutionality of the 1925 charter amendments because the husband had suffered a break in his period of service with the city and his pension rights were therefore governed by the charter provisions as they existed at the time of his reemployment by the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgments determining the rights and recovery of unpaid benefits and declaring the charter amendments unconstitutional, except as to one widow.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a flood control and water conservation district, brought an action in eminent domain against defendant to condemn property for a dam and reservoir. The trial court entered interlocutory and final judgments in favor of plaintiff and fixed the monetary damages. On appeal, the court concluded that beneficial and useful purposes of flood and water conservation included recreational uses. Further, the court concluded that the Monterey County Flood Control and Water Conservation District Act (Act), 1947 Cal. Stat. 699, as it stood when the action was commenced, authorized and empowered plaintiff to condemn property for such recreational uses, particularly as incidental to a project for flood control and water conservation. The court held that the findings, conclusion, and judgment of the trial court, asserting that plaintiff had the authority to condemn defendants' property for recreational uses, were fully supported by the evidence and were correct in law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which following a jury verdict convicted defendant of two counts of kidnapping for purpose of robbery and two counts of first degree robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction on several grounds. The court dismissed with little discussion defendant's claim that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 209 was unconstitutional but agreed with defendant that the counts of the indictment charging kidnapping for the purpose of robbery were not separate crimes from the robbery counts. The court held that defendant's acts of kidnapping, in which he moved two store employees from one room to another where he tied them up, were incidental to the underlying robbery. Consequently, the court held that imposing a sentence for the kidnappings in addition to the robbery was a double punishment in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654. Therefore, defendant could be charged and sentenced on the more serious offenses of kidnapping for the purpose of robbery, but not on the robbery counts. The court also agreed with defendant that because defendant was given straight life imprisonment on the kidnapping charges, all other sentences for other crimes, either from before or after, had to be concurrent as required by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 669.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's conviction on the two robbery counts of the indictment and modified the sentences on the kidnapping counts of the indictment so that they were served concurrently with the sentences on other offenses.

Intervenor landowners sought a declaration that proceedings taken by the water district were invalid. The Superior Court of San Diego County (California) granted the city's requested relief and did not rule on the issue raised by the intervenors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The water district issued bonds for construction of a system to furnish water within an improvement district, which included 4,000 acres that were annexed to the city. The city brought an action to prevent the water district from furnishing water to the inhabitants of the annexed area and from constructing a water distribution system within that area for that purpose. The trial court enjoined the water district's operation of any water works within the city's territory without its consent and enjoined the issuance of bonds for such purpose. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in part, finding the water district's authority over territory annexed by the city was limited by the city's charter, which required the city's consent before a corporation could operate works for supplying water to the city's inhabitants. However, the charter provision did not control the authority of the water district to issue bonds for the construction of water facilities. Further, the validity of the bond issue could only be attacked by an elector or taxpayer of the district. The contentions of the intervenors exceeded the scope of the remedy sought by the city and could not be considered.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the intervenors' appeal.</SPAN></P>

The demurrer of defendant company was sustained as to all causes of action without leave to amend. The demurrer of defendant State of California was sustained as to the first cause of action with leave to amend and as to the remaining causes of action without leave to amend. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because the misjoinders of causes of action was a sufficient ground upon which to predicate a refusal of leave to amend. The court found that the decision to deny plaintiff leave to amend was almost entirely within the discretion of the trial court and found that there was not a manifest abuse of discretion in giving final judgment on demurrer without leave to amend. In the present case, the final pleading of plaintiff was the third amended complaint. It was, therefore, the fourth attempt to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Sacramento County (California) sustained the city transit authority's general demurrer and denied the union and union officials' motion for leave to amend the complaint.

The court analyzed the trial court's decision under the alternative theories that the trial court refused to exercise its power of declaratory relief pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1061, or that the complaint failed to show an actual controversy involving a justiciable question. The court held that it was not reversible error per se to refuse declaratory relief by an order sustaining a general demurrer without leave to amend. Further, the court concluded that the union and union officials' complaint failed to state a justiciable controversy. No allegation was made that at the time of the filing of the action there was any unsettled grievance or other controversy pending under the existing contract. On the contrary, the alleged difficulty concerned a provision not in the contract, and about the legality of which there was a difference of opinion among counsel for the parties.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which determined that the value of the property taken from defendant property owners in an eminent domain action was $ 260,000.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city filed an eminent domain action to acquire property. The trial court initially entered a judgment decreeing condemnation and awarded the property owners $ 237,779. The city subsequently deposited the amount awarded with the trial court. The property owners filed a motion for new trial alleging that the amount of the judgment was insufficient. The trial court then vacated the judgment and awarded the property owners $ 260,000. Upon review, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court determined that the property owners were improperly awarded interest above the amount allowable under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1254 where they were only entitled to receive compensation from the date that possession of the property was given to the city until the date of the judgment. The court found that the property owners could not obtain both the use of money deposited by the city and interest on the compensation and damages awarded. The court concluded the city was bound by a stipulation that it would pay a tax and a penalty where the stipulation was not unlawful under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 2921.5 and the property owners had relied upon the stipulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The serviceman alleged that &sect; 4000 was unconstitutional in that it required him to pay a license fee to register his car. He argued that Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 6700 et seq. exempted certain military personnel from registration, but not those in his classification, rendering Cal Veh. Code &sect; 4000&nbsp;unconstitutional as to him. The statute barred anyone from driving on a highway unless the vehicle was registered and the appropriate fees had been paid. The court found that the registration of motor vehicles operated for the purpose of protecting innocent purchasers against fraud, to provide identification in case of an accident, and as a deterrent to theft. The serviceman had not attempted to register his vehicle and thus, was not asked to pay the disputed fee. The court would not prejudge the action of the trial court. It held that if the lower court decided that the serviceman was required to pay a fee pursuant to Cal Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 10751 and Cal. Veh. Code &sect;&sect; 6700, 6701 and 6705, he had an adequate remedy to challenge the statute by way of appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff buyer corporation acquired the entire manufacturing businesses of plaintiff selling corporations. Each selling corporation held a seller's permit as a retailer selling manufactured goods.

Plaintiffs filed an action for refund of sales taxes under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 6933, claiming that the liquidation sales were occasional and irregular sales not in the regular course of business. Defendant State Board of Equalization (Board) denied the claim for refunds. The trial court determined that the Board properly assessed and collected taxes upon each of the retail sales in question. On appeal, the court affirmed. The sales of the entire businesses were not occasional sales pursuant to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 6006.5 because there was no affiliation between the corporations prior to the sales and the ownership of the property changed after the sales. The court rejected plaintiffs' arguments that the sales taxes were unconstitutional violations of their due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance had been amended to provide for an exemption for hauling earthen materials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city enacted an ordinance that limited to 13 tons the gross weight of any vehicle using a certain avenue; it was amended, inter alia, to reduce the weight limit to 8 tons. The corporation, which leased and operated a quarry, brought the matter into the trial court, and it enjoined the city from enforcing the ordinance. The city appealed, and the court reversed the judgment and directed entry of judgment for the city. The ordinance could not be set aside unless it had no reasonable relation to the public welfare or unless the physical facts showed that there had been an unreasonable, oppressive, or unwarranted interference with property rights by using police power. The court found that there was testimony that the use of the avenue by trucks of a certain weight would cause early breakdown of it and that heavy trucks created a hazard for the many schools located nearby. The evidence proving the justification of the ordinance was fairly debatable. Thus, the trial court's findings that there would be no unreasonable damage or unreasonable traffic hazard could not be upheld. Its conclusion that the alternate route for the corporation was not adequate could also not be sustained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ruling against the corporation, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and directed it to enter a judgment in favor of the city.

The court affirmed the order of injunction and held that (1) because &sect; 11-3 was intended be interpreted to allow for the broadest possible construction, it was clear that the tennis court fencing constituted a structure; (2) the regulation was not unconstitutional because it could have been argued that the elimination of accessory structures from front yards would add to the attractiveness and comfort of a residential district and aid in traffic safety by affording a better view of street corners; and (3) the owners were not entitled to a variance simply because they did not have room to build a tennis court in their backyard because the evidence showed that the owners sold most of their backyard property; thus, they created the limit themselves.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants pled guilty to the offense of petty theft, with a prior felony conviction.

As such, the superior court did not lose jurisdiction to sentence defendants since the statute of limitations did not bar the prosecution of the offenses. The court ruled that defendants were fully advised of their constitutional rights by the trial judge and their owner counsel and freely and voluntarily entered pleas of guilty and admitted the prior convictions as alleged in the consolidated information. The court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667 was not unconstitutional on the theory that it provided for cruel, unusual, or excessive punishment since the statute did not result in punishing defendants twice for the same offense. The additional penalty was considered punishment for the previous offense, and the statute did not subject defendants to involuntary servitude on account of their status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of attempted rape of a female under 18 years of age. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that defendant was properly sentenced to state prison by the trial court under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 664 for attempted rape.  Cal. Penal Code &sect; 264 did not require the place of punishment be fixed by the jury. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant. Although the victim's testimony was conflicting, a portion of her testimony showed that defendant attempted to have intercourse with her. The defendant's niece testified that defendant was with the victim, and there was a positive showing of the vaginal smear for sperm. The court ruled that defendant's intent was proven by the victim's testimony that defendant put his private parts next to hers and that her panties were wet after defendant was finished, and by the finding of sperm. The court ruled that the trial court's failure to instruct of its own motion that the oral admissions of a party should be viewed with caution would not have changed the verdict. There was no miscarriage of justice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) held that Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 262 was constitutional and that plaintiff churches were entitled to a refund of real property taxes and the return of their property that was confiscated for failure to pay taxes. Defendant city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The two churches each failed to file an affidavit of exemption from taxation and were assessed real property taxes. One church paid the taxes and filed an application for a refund pursuant to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 262. The other church did not pay the levied taxes. After their property was sold for delinquent taxes, the church requested an exemption. The city alleged that &sect; 262 was unconstitutional because it was retroactive and that return of the levied taxes and the confiscated property constituted an unlawful gift of public funds to religious organizations. The court affirmed the trial court and held that the legislature was authorized to retroactively reverse its prior legislation. Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1 1/2 granted an exemption from taxation for church property. The withdrawal of the affidavit requirement was carrying out the constitutional mandate. The practical effect of Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 262 was to regard the levy or collection procedures as erroneous. The refund of taxes or property was not an appropriation or payment of &quot;public&quot; funds to a religious organization but merely a return of church property to the rightful owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's order that held that the legislature properly exercised its authority to cancel the waiver provisions for exempt church property and that the churches were entitled to a refund of real property taxes and return of their property.</SPAN></P>

Defendant advised the twin sister to continue pose as her sister and that he would have her released from jail within minutes. Defendant alleged that the evidence did not establish a violation of Cal. Penal Code 529 or a conspiracy to commit the impersonation offense because the sister who was impersonated did not suffer a material pecuniary harm or liability and neither was there a pecuniary gain or tangible advantage to the impersonating sister or another. The court held that the statute was explicit and that it covered any benefit that may have accrued to the sister who was impersonated. The deception could have resulted in her escaping a prison term for the alleged offense of possessing marijuana. There was sufficient evidence of an agreement between the twin sister and defendant to sustain a conspiracy conviction.</SPAN></P>

That statute prohibited the exhibition and distribution, except through designated state agencies, of all printed matter relating to venereal disease and related subjects. Petitioner's one-year jail sentence was suspended, and he was placed on probation for three years. Subsequently, petitioner was held in contempt for violating the conditions of his probation, and he was sentenced to serve 21 days in jail. He then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking release from custody on the grounds that &sect; 600 was unconstitutional. In granting the writ, the court held that &sect; 600 was unconstitutional because it infringed upon constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and press. The court also ruled that the statute constituted a delegation of power to an administrative agency that was not restricted by adequate standards. Thus, because Cal.

Despite advances in refrigeration technology, the necessity of ensuring the safety of meats remained. The ordinance could not be set aside by a showing of change of conditions no greater than the advance in refrigeration technology. The court also ruled that the ordinance could not be set aside because other municipalities lacked a similar ordinance. The court ruled that the admission of a health officer's conversations with 43 other health officers was error.

Since any possible error was procedural and not jurisdictional, consolidation under the statute was not reversible error. Also, evidence that he stole a driver's license, while evidence of another crime, was admissible because it was pertinent to the crime charged. It showed defendant aided the commission of the burglary because he supplied a co-defendant with the stolen license. Next, the telephone conversation, which was an extrajudicial admission, was admissible because it connected defendant to the crime and there was prima facie proof of the corpus delicti of the crime by evidence other than the admission.

Further, the requirement of a periodical physical examination of safety members was not for the benefit of the safety members or any private person or organization, but solely to facilitate the performance by the board of its duties. That this use was for a public use was apparent and the use of public funds for a public purpose did not violate the constitution. Finally, the promulgation of minimum physical standards and the requirement of reexamination of safety members failing to meet those standards were essential regulations to effectuate &sect; 31527(f).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city appealed the decision of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which issued a declaration of the rights of plaintiffs, retired police and firefighters, to fluctuating pensions and to the reimbursement of sums that had accrued in unpaid pension installments. The city argued that an amendment to its charter, which altered the limitations period for filing claims, should have applied retroactively to bar the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When certain police officers and firefighters were hired, their pension benefits provided for a fluctuating pension rate. After the city charter was amended to reflect a fixed pension rate, the pensioners filed a claim to enforce the fluctuating rate. The superior court declared that the pensioners were entitled to the fluctuating rates and awarded specific sums in accrued unpaid benefits. On appeal, the city argued that an amendment to its charter, which barred any claim against the city that was not filed within 90 days of accrual, should bar the pensioners' claims. The court emphasized that the right of a pensioner to payments under a pension was a contractual vested right that could not be destroyed; any statute that purported to do so was unconstitutional. Retroactive application of the procedural change enacted by the city would have just such a result. Instead, the court applied the new rule prospectively and presumed that the legislature had allowed the pensioners a reasonable time within which to file their claims. The court affirmed, except as to one pensioner whose work record did not support an award for excess pay under San Diego, Cal., Ordinance 5623, &sect; 7 (1953).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the superior court's decision to construe the amendment to the city's charter prospectively, to allow the pensioners' claims to be filed, and to award fluctuating pension rates in the future and reimbursement for unpaid accrued pension benefits. The court reversed the decision as to one pensioner, whose work record did not support an award for excess pay under the applicable city ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Four mares had escaped from defendant's field. The bolt and chain indicated that the horses had caused the breaks. The trial court on its own motion read to the jury Cal Agric. Code &sect; 423. Plaintiff asserted that it was error to read to the jury the final sentence of the section, which stated that there was no presumption or inference that a collision between a motor vehicle and a domestic animal was due to negligence on behalf of the owner. Plaintiff argued that the effect of reading the statute was to convey the impression that the jury could draw no inferences at all, but was strictly limited to direct evidence on the issues of negligence and proximate cause. The court did not agree. It held that the statute was designed to bar application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to collisions with livestock. This was constitutionally permissible as the animate self-propulsion of livestock warranted placing it in a class distinct from inanimate objects. Viewing the jury instructions as a whole, the court was satisfied that the jury was not misled. The jury was adequately informed that it should not infer negligence from the mere happening of the accident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant contended that the provisions of &sect; 13130 should not have been applied to him because there were other offenders, convicted of similar crimes, who were not covered by &sect; 13130's classification.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment finding that &sect; 13130's classification was constitutional. The court found that the legislature had the discretion to create a lawful classification and that &sect; 13130 was not to be declared unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause merely because there might have been other instances to which the legislation might have applied. The court determined that the classification had a rational basis and that the state had a right and a duty to screen teachers. The court also found that the applicant was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to seeking relief in court because the board was not a lawmaking body and it did not have the power to disregard, amend or repeal the provisions of the Education Code.

Section 90, which authorized the Commission to select the most direct and practicable location for a highway, was sufficiently definite to guide the Commission in the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the legislature.

The due process and privileges and immunities clauses were not violated. The claimant did not have a fundamental right in old age assistance. His only right was to make application for old age benefits. It was reasonable for the state to require that, as a qualification for assistance, the claimant exhaust his potential resources.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a preceding ordinance was struck down by the court, the city adopted a new ordinance, which imposed a tax on the transient use of hotel rooms in the city. The ordinance defined transient use as the rental of a room for less than 30 days. The trial court upheld the ordinance, and likened it to a sales tax imposed on the privilege of eating a meal at a restaurant. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that a tax on the privilege to stay in certain rooms, under certain conditions, for specified lengths of time, was within the city's taxing power. The court further held that the classification of the ordinance, which treated differently those who rented rooms for less than 30 days, as opposed to those who rented for more than 30 days, was a reasonable classification. The court noted with approval that, within the classification, every person within the class specified was treated equally.</SPAN></P>

The injured persons claimed the right of way under a city ordinance that gave cars in a funeral procession the right of way where certain conditions were met. On appeal, the court reversed the judgments of the trial court as to the driver that appealed. The city ordinance was invalid because it conflicted with &sect; 476(f), which only allowed the disobedience of traffic lights under certain conditions that were not applicable to the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trustee represented the estate of the deceased taxpayer and contended that the taxpayer's estate was due a refund for overpaid state income taxes. In the taxable year of 1938, the taxpayer reported a gain on the dissolution of a corporation. In reporting the gain, the taxpayer used as the basis of his stock the cost to him of the stock of an acquired corporation. In 1928, the taxpayer had exchanged his shares in an acquired corporation for the shares that he held until 1938. The trustee contended that there was no state income tax law in 1928 to recognize the gain and that the gain should have been recognized in 1928, the year of the exchange. The court held that, because the transaction was a &quot;reorganization&quot; under I.R.C. &sect; 203(b)(2) (1926), no taxable gain resulted in 1928. Because there was no law applicable in 1928, no increase or decrease was recognized, and therefore the basis of the taxpayer's stock was the same as in the case of the property exchanged. Accordingly, the gain was in fact realized in 1938.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed that the trustee was not entitled to a refund. The taxpayer's gain was properly taxed in the year that it was realized, which was the year that the corporation was dissolved.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner claimed that as an indigent person, she was entitled to a court reporter's transcript as a matter of right without having to make a proper showing of need. The only showing of need for the transcript petitioner made was that her counsel did not represent her at trial and was unaware of any errors that might have occurred. However, petitioner's counsel made no attempt to secure a settled statement and resisted all efforts of the trial court to procure a settled statement. The court found that it was petitioner's duty to make a bona fide attempt to procure a settled statement for use upon appeal and only if that failed, could she have shown the need for transcript to be furnished to her at the county's expense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, an electrical contractor licensed by the state, brought suit to enjoin enforcement of certain ordinances of defendant city on the ground that they conflicted with general law and thus were unconstitutional. The municipal code in question imposed certain requirements on an electrical contractor and required the payment of a fee in order to obtain a license tax registration number. The lower court entered judgment in favor of the city. Appellant challenged the decision and the state supreme court reversed, holding that provisions of the ordinance were invalid to the extent they conflicted with Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 7000-7145. The municipal code was subsequently amended in response to that decision. Appellant then filed an amended complaint, which was dismissed. Appellant challenged the decision. The court found that the municipal code, as amended, did not interfere with state regulations or prescribe qualifications for electrical contractors different from or in addition to those prescribed by the state. The amended municipal code also clarified that the tax on the contractors was an exercise of the taxing power for revenue purposes, and thus was not invalid.</SPAN></P>

The city council affirmed the board, and the court affirmed the trial court's findings because the ordinance neither unconstitutionally invaded the state regulation of liquor nor did it constitute an attempted exercise of local option. The legislature specifically provided in Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 23790, 23791, that licensing was subject to a valid zoning ordinance, and the court found that the ordinance was valid in that it was a geographic restriction for the place of sale and use of liquor and it did not interfere with the state's general regulation of the consumption of liquor. The court further found that the city's decision was not arbitrary and that it was for the board to determine whether the applicant met the burden of proving that the public was not detrimentally affected by the proposed use. Thus, the city had the right to enforce its zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled that &sect;&sect; 103.102, 103.29, and 103.31 were not unconstitutional, and the court affirmed. The court held that the purpose of &sect;&sect; 103.102, 103.29, and 103.31 was not to regulate the liquor business but was to regulate the kind of live entertainment that was furnished in such public places as restaurants and liquor establishments. The state had not preempted the field or area covered by &sect;&sect; 103.102, 103.29, and 103.31. The ordinance was a valid exercise of police power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The salesmen argued that it was an error for the trial court to permit into evidence a certification by a supervising deputy in the office of the commissioner and a declaration by a deputy attorney general both under penalty of perjury to be filed. According to the salesmen, there was a doubt as to whether the certification or the declarations were additions to the complaint, which would have been required to plead. On appeal, the court held that the documents were filed in lieu of affidavits, which would support the issuance of a preliminary injunction. Next, the salesmen argued that the preliminary injunction was premature. The court determined that the injunction order was not premature because an injunction may have been granted at any time before judgment upon a verified compliant, or upon affidavits. The salesmen then argued that the salesmen were not required by law to be licensed as real estate brokers at the time of the filing of the complaint. The salesmen were performing acts defined as duties of real estate salesmen pursuant to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 10132.1. Moreover, the preliminary injunction was not inconsistent with the record. Thus, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The landowner appealed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.

The court held that Cal. Gov.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which convicted defendant for driving a vehicle upon a public highway while addicted to the use of narcotic drugs in violation Cal.

Defendant argued that it could not be determined whether the word &quot;addicted&quot; referred to habitually taking or otherwise using narcotics to the extent of having lost the power of self-control or whether it referred to merely using narcotics without reference to whether the power of self-control was lost. The court examined the ordinary, dictionary definition of the word &quot;addicted&quot; and held that it was unlawful for any person &quot;addicted to the use&quot; of narcotic drugs to drive a vehicle upon any highway. Defendant stated there was no evidence that he lost the power of self-control. Since the court has held that &quot;addicted to the use&quot; in &sect; 23105 does not necessarily mean that a person has lost the power of self-control, the point was without merit. There was ample evidence that defendant was addicted to the use of narcotic drugs and therefore the judgment of conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Respondent city officials claimed that there was no withdrawal of any civil service employee from the system, the charter provisions did not apply, and the charter provision in question contravened the California Constitution, which reserved to the electorate through the initiative and referendum the right to legislate by majority action. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that dismissed the association and members' petition based on the city official's demurrer and held that the California Constitution provided that referendum initiative were to be by a majority vote and that the city's charter that attempted to require a two-thirds vote was unconstitutional. The court further held that Ord. No. 511 caused no withdrawal of any employee from the system and that the ordinance scheme specifically left the civil service members in the system.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the dismissal of the petition.

The court held that reclamation board and the drainage districts were authorized to acquire property under 1913 Cal.

The court held that the state acquired fee simple title to the property in controversy, including rights to oil and gas. Further, the court held that the trial court properly requested the association to post bond in excess of the statutory minimum under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 647 because it protected the state's interest in recovering a reasonable attorney fee and costs if the association's action failed. After the court affirmed the award of costs and attorney fees at the trial level, the court ordered the association to pay an additional attorney fee to cover the state's legal expenses of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, forbidding pickets to be closer than 30 feet apart in a prescribed area did not have any reasonable basis for discrimination between members of the public desiring to speak of labor problems and those desiring to communicate on different problems; forbidding picketing of a place adjacent to a business with whom the picketer did not have a labor dispute did not have any relationship to the announced purpose of protecting traffic and was repugnant to the rights of free speech; and forbidding a picketer to walk in a circular, oval, or rectangular manner gave no appearance of accomplishing traffic safety.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, holding that the hospital was entitled to a refund, that the exemption for nonprofit hospitals was a well-recognized public purpose, and that the legislature could retroactively dispense with the requirement of an affidavit. Because the retroactive cancellation of the hospital's liability for property taxes was enacted for a public purpose, the cancellation was not a gift of public money.

The superior court declared that his retirement allowance was half of the active police chief's salary, and he was awarded the difference between that amount and the lesser amount that he had received since his retirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During the police chief's active tenure, the city adopted Emeryville, Cal., Ordinance 224 (1929), which provided him with a pension benefit of one-half of the salary of the acting police chief. Before he retired, the city repealed that ordinance, and he received less than one-half of the active chief's salary for his first three years of retirement. The retired chief brought an action against the city to establish his entitlement to one-half of the active chief's salary and to recover the shortage for the period since his retirement, and the superior court entered a judgment in his favor. The court affirmed the superior court's judgment and found that the chief had a vested right to the benefit pegged to the position's existing salary. In its ruling, the court found that the chief acquired a vested right in the retirement system that was in effect during his rendition of service and that the city's plan could not be changed thereafter to the chief's disadvantage unless the city compensated him for the change. The court ruled that the city's establishment of its substitute pension plan was an advantage to the city, not to the chief, even if it was sound on an actuarial basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction for petty theft was a misdemeanor, and she filed an affidavit of defendant in forma pauperis with her notice to the municipal court to prepare a transcript of her trial at the expense of the city and county under Cal.

The superior court rejected defendant's claim that she was entitled to a transcript of the trial proceedings without cost even if the transcript was necessary to defendant's appeal from her conviction. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the superior court to sustain the municipal's court's demurrer and its denial of defendant's application for a writ of mandamus. Defendant's writ application recited allegations to establish the insufficiency of a settled statement as an alternative to a transcript for the purposes of appeal. The proceedings in the municipal court were too complex and a transcript of those proceedings was necessary to defendant's appeal. Defendant's right to a transcript, without cost, was not limited by the classification of her crime as a misdemeanor as opposed to a felony.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed defendants' convictions and modified the sentence of the second defendant pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 644, 669. Due process of law did not require the State to obtain an indictment against defendants, and prosecution by information was a proper alternative remedy. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in its denial of defendants' motion for a continuance because their rejection of the services of their public defender was an attempt to postpone the trial. Defendants failed to exercise their opportunity to present an alibi defense. Modification of the second defendant's sentence was required under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant contended based her request for a writ of prohibition upon her argument that the statute under which she was convicted was unconstitutional.

The municipal court contended that the issuance of a writ of prohibition not serve any useful purpose. On appeal, the court agreed, holding that appellant had pursued the wrong remedy. The court reasoned that all of the matters that appellant attempted to raise on her application for writ of prohibition could have been and should have been raised upon an appeal from the judgment of the municipal court. The court concluded that the writ of prohibition could not be used to take the place of an appeal or other mode of review even though objections thereto were based upon jurisdictional grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The real party in interest filed an appeal of the judgment in favor of the county in the superior court on May 18, 1959. Because the action had not been brought to trial, the county filed a motion in the superior court to dismiss the appeal. The superior court denied the motion. The county then filed a petition for a writ of mandate to compel the superior court to dismiss the appeal. The court held that Cal.  Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 117jj (1959) was added to provided that appeals had to be dismissed where the appealing party failed to bring the appeal to trial within one year from the date of filing the appeal in the superior court. Thus, dismissal was voluntary after the expiration of one year. The burden was on the appealing party to show that he had been unable, from causes beyond his control, to bring the case to trial within one year. The legislation limiting the time for performance of a procedural act was not unconstitutional if adequate means of enforcing the remedy remained. Although &sect; 117jj was added four months after the appeal was filed, the remaining eight months for the real party in interest to bring the appeal was amply if due diligence were exercised.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that granting of the county's motion to dismiss was mandatory and it issued the peremptory writ of mandate directing dismissal of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant license holder challenged an order of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California) vacating a writ and denying a peremptory writ of mandate, thereby approving respondent California Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board's ruling upholding an order of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (DABC) that adopted a hearing officer's findings that the holder violated the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Finding that the holder had violated Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 25601 and &sect; 24200, subd.

Const. art. XX, &sect; 22. Though the Board reversed a part of the ruling, it sustained revocation based on the &sect; 25601 violation. The superior court ultimately upheld the Board's decision and denied the writ. The holder appealed, claiming that there was no proof of knowledge on the part of the holder or its agents of the commission of proscribed acts, and that the evidence in any case was insufficient to prove knowledge. The court affirmed. It held that under &sect; 25601, &quot;permit&quot; did not mean knowledge but it in fact implied no affirmative act, involved no intent, and was satisfied by mere passivity on the holder's part. Moreover, &quot;knowledge&quot; was proved for statutory purposes by a mere showing that the proscribed acts occurred. Finally, the court noted that the revocation was properly affirmed in any event on the basis of the alternate constitutional ground. Accordingly, the revocation was upheld.</SPAN></P>

The court held that no depositor of a bank has rights that were remotely similar to that of an owner. The court held that plaintiffs' claims through inheritance failed because, in each case, the account that originally formed the basis for the membership, or ownership of the bank, had been closed. When plaintiffs later opened their own accounts, the bank had changed its bylaws to eliminate the benefit that, by opening an account, the account holder became a share holder, or member, of the bank.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two informers told officers that a person known by a specified nickname was selling heroin on a specified street. Other police officers told them that the person known by the nickname was defendant. They found that defendant had a prior narcotics record. The officer observed defendant talking to known narcotics users who told them that defendant was dealing in narcotics up an down the same street as was indicated by the informers. When the officers learned defendant's address, they went to that address in plain clothes. As defendant opened the door to his apartment, they approached him. He ran in and closed the door. After they forced the door open, they saw defendant coming from the bathroom. They conducted a search and found balloons of heroin. Defendant told them that it was for its own use. The court held, on appeal, that there was probable cause for the arrest because there was enough to arouse in the minds of the officers a suspicion founded on circumstances that would warrant a reasonable man in the belief that defendant was in the possession of narcotics.

Some of his business was done within respondent city, and under Berkeley, Cal., Ordinance 2805-N.S., he was required to pay a license fee. The business filed an action for declaratory relief to have the city ordinance declared unconstitutional, but the trial court determined that it was valid and enforceable in all respects. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the businessman's claim that the state had occupied the field of regulation was inapplicable because the city sought to enforce its licensing ordinance for revenue purposes only, not regulation. The fact that the city required the businessman to affix a sticker to each of his vehicles as an aid to enforcement did not make the tax a regulatory one. The court refused to rule on the validity of the section that required a license before doing a single act of business because the businessman, doing one-sixth of his business in the city, was not a party aggrieved by any possible application of that section. Even if that provision was illegal, it did not affect the validity of the remaining portions under Berkeley, Cal., Ordinance 2805-N.S. &sect; 8.1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The rancher was charged with violating the section of the ordinance requiring cover crops or other dust control methods on turkey farms. The trial court held that appellants had no jurisdiction to try the rancher for the alleged offense because the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court held that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the police power and did not deprive the rancher of his property without due process of law. The ordinance was sufficiently explicit to inform turkey ranchers what was required of them, and it was unreasonable to suppose that any turkey rancher in an agricultural zone who was possessed of ordinary intelligence could misunderstand its meaning. The finding of the trial court that the part of the ordinance under attack was unreasonable and discriminatory in that it did not apply to the raising of chickens on chicken ranches could not be sustained. The question of whether or not the chicken ranches created a sufficient problem to require the same restrictions as were applied to turkey ranches was a question of policy for the board of supervisors to decide, and the trial court was not justified in holding that the classification was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

In reversing the trial court's judgment, the court ruled that a tribunal had jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction. Respondent had not in the justice court challenged the jurisdiction of that court by demurrer, motion, plea, or other objection so that the justice court could have preliminarily decided the question of whether it had jurisdiction. Therefore, there was nothing for the trial court to prohibit. Respondent's allegation that the justice court had denied respondent's plea of unconstitutionality in an earlier case did not validate the writ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the California Director of Agriculture and his subsidiary Bureau of Dairy Service, challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which enjoined the State from the enforcement of various provisions of the Agricultural Code against a product manufactured by respondent manufacturers and sold under their trade name, being a dessert topping suitable for use on pies, cakes, and sundaes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The manufacturers, the owners of the trademark and its licensee for manufacture and sale in the San Francisco, California area, filed an action against the State that sought to enjoin the enforcement of various provisions of the California Agricultural Code against them. The trial court found that the topping did not imitate a milk product, found that the statutes were unconstitutional, and enjoined their application. On appeal, the State argued that the use by the manufacturers of nonfat milk solids in its ingredients required the application of Cal. Agric. Code &sect;&sect; 638, 654, 655, and prevented the manufacture of the topping because it imitated a milk product or adulterated a milk product through the addition of non-milk fats and oils. The court affirmed the essential findings as to non-imitation and inapplicability of &sect; 638 because they were supported by evidence. The court rejected, as surplusage, those portions of the judgment that declared the unconstitutionality of &sect;&sect; 638, 654, 655 either conditionally by reason of their application to the particular product or by reason of discriminatory enforcement by the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the judgment of the trial court by striking therefrom the paragraphs that declared that the particular code sections were unconstitutional and held that the State officers involved were knowingly and intentionally guilty of unequal and discriminatory enforcement against the manufacturers in favor of segments of the dairy industry. The court affirmed the modified judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the information, which charged defendant of unlawfully taking the personal property of another, was sufficient under Cal.

The evidence was sufficient to support the verdict because the jury could have reasonably inferred from the evidence that defendant was a participant in a certain transaction.

Gov. Code &sect;&sect; 54950-54958.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to public notices, public meetings were held by the commission and by the city council on a property owner's application for a zoning change. The commission recommended granting the application with certain conditions. The city council concluded that the commission's conditions were excessive, and adopted an ordinance approving the zoning change with a different set of conditions. The trial court found in favor of the city council and held that the Brown Act, Cal. Gov. Code &sect;&sect; 54950-54958, did not apply because the city in question was a charter city. On appeal, the court found that the Brown Act did apply to the city but that a dinner meeting hosted by the property owner four days before his zoning application was not an illegal secret meeting because it did not involve a specific discussion of the property owner's plan. Given the formal hearing process that occurred, there was little chance that the dinner meeting influenced the commission and it most likely did not influence the city council at all. An amendment to the city's basic zoning ordinance was valid, though made without prior public notice, because it was legislative, and not administrative, in character.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff district attorney filed a complaint for the abatement of a public nuisance pursuant to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 25604. The Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California) held that defendants violated &sect; 25604 by maintaining premises for the consumption of alcohol without a license from the department of alcoholic beverage control, and issued an injunction. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The department of alcoholic beverage control's agents and police officers visited defendants' restaurant. They observed that the waitresses served a mix of soda, Seven-up, or water with ice for a charge, and that people poured liquids from bottles that appeared to contain alcoholic beverages. Additionally, the waitresses sold alcoholic beverages to the officers upon request. On appeal, defendants initially challenged the denial of their right to trial by jury. The court found no right to a jury trial in a suit to abate a public nuisance because none existed at common law. Next, the court found no merit in defendants' assertion that evidence of 127 bottles containing alcoholic beverages should have been suppressed because the officers did not have a search warrant. The court found that the evidence was admissible because the search was made after a crime was committed in the officers' presence. The court rejected defendants' contention that the evidence was insufficient to support the finding of a public nuisance. Finally, the court upheld the constitutionality of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 25604.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the injunction that restrained defendants from maintaining their restaurant's premises for the consumption of alcohol without a license from the department of alcoholic beverage control.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners had used their wooden seven-story building for residential purposes. The trial court reviewed the board's decision to vacate and demolish and determined that the building was in such a state of deterioration, instability, and so unfit for use, that it was no longer reasonably repairable and amounted to a public nuisance, which could only be reasonably abated by demolition. On appeal, the court held that the board's order was supported by ample persuasive evidence to justify its order to demolish as the only way to abate the nuisance. The property owners offered testimony as to the estimated cost of repairs to put the building in a reasonably safe condition. The court noted a great disparity in estimates to repair the building, and determined that the public nuisance could not be reasonably abated by means other than demolition because even the largest sum would not bring it up to the safety requirements. The court held that the municipal code standards were constitutional because they were reasonable and substantially related to their object of protecting public health, safety and general welfare, and the board's order was a proper exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the owners contended that there was insufficient evidence to support the findings of the trial court. The court affirmed and held that the factual findings of the trial court and the board clearly supported demolition of the owners' property in order to provide for the health and safety of neighboring persons and property. The court rejected the owners' contention that the board's actions were preempted by the Community Redevelopment Act (Act), Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 33000 et seq. The state had not designated the building's area as a &quot;slum&quot; in need of redevelopment, and nothing in the Act provided for the preemption of a local government's police powers to protect its citizens.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Decedent husband died intestate having been predeceased by his wife and neither having left children or parents. The couple had moved to California for retirement and the property they held had been acquired in common law property states.

The court found that in the determination of the character of property for the purpose of Cal. Prob. Code &sect;&sect; 228 and 229, the critical question was that of the source of the acquisition of the property rather than the nature of its ownership just before death. The court held that property acquired through the efforts of a married couple during the course of their marriage were properly converted to community property by virtue of the laws of domicile once the parties became domiciled in the sate. The court affirmed the prior decree having determined that the heirs of the predeceased wife took not through direct succession from her, but as statutory heirs of the husband.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed, but it found that under the applicable caselaw, the incriminating admissions of defendant provided the necessary corroboration.

The minority applicant sued the gymnasium owner for damages based on violations of Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 51, 52 (1956). The trial court found that the gymnasium was open to engagement by some and not all members of the general public, that the gymnasium owner did not furnish courses of education to all members of the general public, and &sect; 51 and &sect; 52 were not applicable because the gymnasium was not a place of public amusement or public accommodation at the time the minority applicant was denied admission. Judgment was entered in favor of the gymnasium owner, and the minority applicant appealed. In affirming the trial court's judgement, the court held that &sect; 51 and &sect; 52 were applicable to places of public accommodation and amusement and the gymnasium did not fall into these categories. Comparing the gymnasium to a private school, the court found that it was not open to the public in general, and that the gymnasium owner could limit its membership by excluding those persons management saw proper to exclude.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that the ordinance did not apply to the officers and affirmed the verdict. The purpose of the ordinance was to have regulated the practice of door-to-door solicitation of business for the purpose of soliciting orders for the sale of goods, ware, and merchandise and of disposing of or peddling or hawking the same. Therefore, the ordinance was not applicable to the activity to have been engaged in by the officers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a habeas corpus action to secure his release from custody, petitioner alleged that respondent county sheriff (California) unlawfully restrained him by a criminal complaint issued by the Municipal Court of the Concord Judicial District (California) charging him with violating Contra Costa, Cal., Ordinance 142, alleging that petitioner unlawfully played and carried on a game played with dice for money within the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner argued that the ordinance unconstitutionally conflicted in jurisdiction with Cal. Penal Code &sect; 330. Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11 provided that a county could make and enforce any ordinance that did not conflict with general laws. The preemption test was whether the concrete provisions of the state law occupied a particular field, or only part of it, and left the local regulations an implied freedom to supplement. Local government was commonly accepted to operate in the field of gambling. In denying the writ, the court relied heavily on a state gambling case in which a city ordinance that closely paralleled the Contra Costa County ordinance conflicted with the state penal code. That petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied because that petitioner failed to show that the game he was charged with playing was the proscribed percentage game of the state statute. The court likewise rejected petitioner's argument that the games with dice appeared in both state and local enactment and held that he did not establish that his dice game was a preempted percentage game. The county's ordinance excluded the state-prohibited gambling and was not vague and uncertain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The licensees were four persons engaged in and licensed to engage in the wholesale liquor business in California. They generally obtained their bourbon whiskey from distillers in Kentucky, their gin and vodka from Boston, and some items of distilled spirits from California. The shipments from the east required two weeks or more before delivery in California. After the Department adopted rule 28, the licensees instituted their action, claiming that rule 28, which set forth requirements as to the licensees' warehouse space and stock, was unconstitutional. The court held that rule 28 was valid, noting that Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 23778 provided that the licensees were not entitled to licenses unless they kept a reasonable stock of distilled spirits as determined by the Department. The court further held that the Department, under rule 28, codified at Cal. Code Regs. tit. 4, &sect;&sect; 1-145 (1957), set forth the requirements to prescribe the maintenance of a reasonable stock on hand as a prerequisite to holding such a license.

The board determined that the physician was guilty of unprofessional conduct in failing to make the report required by &sect; 11425 respecting his patients who, the board found, were habitual users of narcotics but not addicts. The court held that the term &quot;habitual users&quot; lacked the certainty of standard required of a regulatory statute and gave the physician no reasonable standard for compliance. Because the board based its decision on an alleged violation of the unconstitutional phrase of &sect; 11425, the decision was not supported by the findings and, thus, constituted an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the landowners had not exhausted their administrative remedies. The landowners requested an amendment to the zoning ordinance to change the zone of their particular property, but a change of zone was a legislative, not an administrative remedy. The court held that the landowners would not have a cause of action until they made an application for an exception and unreasonable restrictions or conditions were imposed. The court further held that the fact that the landowners experienced some hardship or that it may have been more profitable to make other use of the property was not controlling in determining whether the regulations were arbitrary or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the request for a writ of mandamus, and the court affirmed the decision. The court held that the city council's resolution that froze building permits was a proper exercise of police power. The court held that the resolution was not in conflict with Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 33749 or with Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 33574, which had been repealed. The court found that the only duty imposed upon the local community by both of those sections was that the applicant for a permit &quot;be advised.&quot; The court held that the mere fact that the state, in the exercise of its police power, had made certain regulations, did not prohibit the municipality from exacting additional requirements, so long as there was no conflict between the two and such requirements were not unreasonable. The court found it difficult to conceive how an intelligent integrated redevelopment plan could be formulated if, during planning, the area was in a constant state of flux with new construction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the city council. The judgment discharged an alternative writ of mandamus and denied a petition for a peremptory writ of mandamus in the action brought by the property owner and purchaser challenging a resolution forbidding the issuance of building permits in an area of redevelopment.</SPAN></P>

The licensee sought mandamus in the trial court to set aside and expunge the revocation. The trial court denied the writ. On appeal, the court affirmed. The legislature, by empowering officers of the DMV to determine whether an operator's license should be revoked, did not confer judicial power upon executive officers. The authority was a lawful delegation of legislative power. The legislation was not a delegation of absolute legislative discretion, but provided DMV a complete and comprehensive guide for its action. The licensee was not denied due process. At the conclusion of its investigation, the DMV gave notice to the licensee that it was considering revoking his operator's license and of his right to a hearing. He failed to request a formal hearing, but appeared and testified at an informal hearing. Due process was satisfied. The fact that the licensee might suffer inconvenience or economic loss because he was denied a license as a result of his driving record did not make the remedial action of the DMV the imposition of punishment for past offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with lewd conduct with children and with committing crimes against nature. Defendant requested probation, but the request was denied. Defendant was convicted on all charges, and filed a motion for a new trial that was denied. Defendant challenged the decisions of the trial court first contending that he was unconstitutionally deprived of the right to confront his accusers face to face and cross-examine them, and that due process of law was thereby denied him. The court noted that the deposition testimony was taken before a magistrate with defendant's presence, which offered an opportunity for cross-examination. Thus the court concluded that it did not appear that defendant's constitutional rights were infringed. Defendant then argued that prejudicial error was committed by taking foundation evidence in the presence of the jury. The court noted that defendant was unable to point out the particular evidentiary matters that resulted in prejudice to his case. Therefore, his failure to comply with this requirement rendered his argument meritless. Defendant's remaining contentions were equally without merit, and his conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant brought an action alleging that the deed was forged. Appellees contended that the holder was the legal and equitable owner and that a prior judgment had quieted title in the holder.

When the claimant next filed a memorandum to set the cause for trial, appellees filed a motion to dismiss based on Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 583, which required that the cause be brought to trial within five years. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the period of the stay was excluded in computing the five-year period. However, at most the stay would have continued until the denial of the claimant's petition for a hearing on the prior judgment quieting title. Even excluding that period, the claimant's rights had expired under the five-year rule. Also, the period was not extended for holidays.</SPAN></P>

The corporation withheld Canadian taxes from dividend payments. For several years, the taxpayers, in filing their California tax returns, reported the gross amount of the dividends and claimed the Canadian taxes as deductions from gross income. Thereafter, the taxpayers sought to obtain California tax refunds on the ground that they were entitled to the credit provided by Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax.

The court affirmed the denial of the refunds, finding that the Canadian taxes, which were imposed on the gross income from the dividends, did not constitute net income taxes. Consequently, the Canadian taxes did not qualify as allowable credits under &sect; 18001. The court further held that the legislative policy of permitting credit only for taxes similar to the California tax did not deprive the taxpayers of the equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the heir was not entitled to compensation where the heir's reversionary interest terminated upon the condemnation and his interest became remote and speculative because at the moment of the condemnation there was had been no misuse by the city of the land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The challenged ordinance required hotel owners to collect from transients a tax upon the compensation paid for lodging rentals. All persons obtaining lodging in establishments containing less than five accommodations were completely exempt from the tax. The court held that the hotel owner had standing to maintain the action because of the inconvenience of collecting the tax and because of the probable loss of business to nearby communities that imposed no similar tax. The court further concluded that there was no reasonable distinction for tax purposes, from the viewpoint of a lodger, between a large establishment capable of accommodating many people and a small one accommodating a lesser number. Accordingly, the ordinance violated the constitutional requirement of uniformity of intended application.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 288a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and his codefendant were inmates in a state prison when they were observed engaging in oral sexual copulation. They were placed in solitary confinement as discipline for the offense under the prison's regulations. Following their indictment, they were tried before a jury. After the close of evidence but before the verdict, one juror was excused due to illness. The parties stipulated to permit the case to be decided by the remaining 11 jurors, who returned a guilty verdict. The trial court convicted defendant and his codefendant. Defendant appealed. Because no objection was made at trial, defendant had failed to preserve his speedy trial challenge. However, under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, defendant was not an accused party until he was indicted. The solitary confinement was not an arrest under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 834. Defendant's speedy trial rights were governed by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1381. Binding precedent allowed defendant to consent to trial by less than 12 jurors. Defendant's attack on Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288a as applied to prisoners presumed without authority an intent to encourage procreation. The criminality of unnatural sexual relations was embedded in common law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant newspaper publisher sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which entered a judgment for respondent competitor and modified a prior judgment that had adjudicated the publisher's newspaper to be a newspaper of general circulation within a city and determined that it was presently a newspaper of general circulation within a county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1952, the publisher's newspaper was adjudged to be a newspaper of general circulation for the city, county, and State of California. Thereafter, the competitor filed a motion to have the adjudication vacated, pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 6024, on the grounds that the publisher's newspaper was no longer printed and published in the city. The publisher conceded that its printing was not done in city, but asserted that the substantial business affairs of its newspaper were conducted there. The trial court modified the 1952 decree and found that the publisher's newspaper was a newspaper of general circulation for the county and state. The court held that the use of the word &quot;may&quot; in &sect; 6024 did not give a superior court the discretion to determine whether a subsequent substantial departure from Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 6000 should be disregarded. Further, in order to qualify as a &quot;newspaper of general circulation,&quot; the newspaper had to be printed and published in the same city. Finally, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 6024 was constitutional as applied to the publisher because it was not unreasonable to expect that local citizens would rely on such newspapers for matters of local public importance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was engaged in the mortgage and finance business using different names. Defendant induced the landowners, a husband and wife with limited education, to buy a truck and 10 acres of unimproved property in exchange for the landowners' two rental houses. In reliance on defendant, the landowners signed papers and made payments. When the truck was repossessed and the landowners discovered that the documents did not memorialize the oral agreement, defendant was charged with crimes and was convicted of grand theft. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. Section 952 was not unconstitutional, and the information sufficiently alleged that defendant unlawfully took the labor or property of another. Defendant's activities were part of a single scheme to appropriate the property of the landowners. The evidence warranted a conviction for theft based upon any one of three distinct acts of embezzlement committed by defendant. At most, the information merely contained an erroneous description of the stolen property, and the variance was harmless. Defendant was not deprived of his right to counsel, and his motion for a new trial lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

While that judgment remained unsatisfied, the judgment debtor instituted an unrelated action against the insurance company. The judgment creditor filed a motion pursuant to &sect; 688.1 to have a lien placed upon the judgment debtor's cause of action against the insurance company. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the judgment creditor argued that the trial court's decision to grant the motion was not appealable, and the judgment debtor argued that &sect; 688.1 violated his freedom to contract because it required that the judgment debtor obtain the approval of the judgment creditor before entering into a settlement. The court affirmed the trial court's decision and found that the order granting the lien was a final decision on a collateral matter and was therefore appealable. The court also found that &sect; 688.1 was not unconstitutional because the restrictions imposed were a reasonable safeguard to a fraudulent or collusive settlement of the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A prison warden prohibited an inmate from writing manuscripts for publication. The inmate violated the order and wrote a book. The attorney, who represented the inmate, received the manuscript in the mail. The book was eventually published. The attorney was indicted, along with the book's publisher and the inmate's literary agent, for conspiracy under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 182 for violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4570, which delegated authority to the warden to refuse communication with a prisoner. The attorney filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. The superior court denied the motion. The attorney filed a petition for a writ of prohibition, requesting that the superior court be restrained from proceeding on the indictment. The court issued the writ and found that the indictment, which was based on the theory that the state acquired an automatic ownership in an inmate's creativity, was not supported in the law. Although the court held that the indictment supported the limited conspiratorial purpose of taking a manuscript from the prison without permission, the attorney's possession of the manuscript did not in itself supply evidence that he took the manuscript from the prison.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding in mandamus to compel the State Board of Pharmacy to annul its order suspending petitioner's license to practice as a licentiate in pharmacy for 30 days.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pharmacist sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) that denied the pharmacist's petition for a writ of mandate to compel respondent California State Board of Pharmacy (board) to annul its order suspending the pharmacist's license to practice for 30 days and placing him on probation for one year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A board investigator was able to fill a prescription at the pharmacy in the absence of the pharmacist. The pharmacist was then charged with permitting a person who was not a registered pharmacist to compound and sell a prescription in violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 4385, and neglecting to place a registered pharmacist in charge of the pharmacy during his absence in violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 4386. The board suspended the pharmacist's license with a stay and probation. On appeal from the denial of his petition for a writ of mandate to compel the board to annul its decision, the pharmacist argued that the board's findings could not support its conclusion that he had permitted the selling of drugs by an unregistered pharmacist when he had specifically instructed his employee not to make such sales. The court affirmed the denial of the pharmacist's petition for a writ of mandate, and held that the board's findings were supported by substantial evidence. The court found that the legislature differentiated between knowingly permitting an act and merely permitting it, and that when the legislature intended that an act must be knowingly permitted, it had so stated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment denying the pharmacist's petition for a writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>
