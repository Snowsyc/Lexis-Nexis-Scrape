The employer and carrier challenged jurisdiction on appeal, contending that the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 901 et seq., governed the case. The court held, however, that the deceased worker's employment was maritime but local; hence, the state had authority to award compensation under state law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the decision of the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond (Virginia), which entered a judgment of conviction for multiple counts of capital murder during the commission of: an armed robbery, rape or following a rape, robbery, and use of a firearm. Defendant was sentenced to death in each of the capital murder cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of the capital murder of a number of individuals. The trial court accepted the jury's recommendation that his sentence be fixed at death in each of the capital murder cases. Defendant as a matter of right sought appellate review of his death sentence and appealed all of his convictions. The court found no abuse of discretion by the lower court in denying defendant's motion for a change of venue or of venire due to prejudice by substantial media coverage. The court held that the commonwealth only had to prove that the defendant was the triggerman in the murder and an accomplice in the robbery or rape to convict him of capital murder. There were no Brady violations regarding the tapes of a co-defendant because his statements to the police were not viewed as exculpatory and they amounted to a confession of co-defendant's involvement. The evidence overwhelmingly sustained the findings of the jury and the actions of the trial court. Finally, the court found no merit in the contention that Virginia's capital murder statutes were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, finding no reversible error in his convictions and sentences, and no other reason to disturb or commute his death sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff filed an action seeking to validate a proposed bond issue for the construction of multifamily housing pursuant to the Virginia Housing Development Authority Act (Act), Va. Code Ann &sect;&sect; 36-55.24 to 36-55.52. Defendants argued the Act was unconstitutional because it authorized financing for persons of other than low and moderate income. The trial court validated the bonds. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held the Act was constitutional where in order to provide proper housing for those of low and moderate income, it was necessary to provide housing for persons of other economic levels, to encourage an infusion of such families into a housing project for the disadvantaged. The court found that the dominant intention of the Act was to provide housing for low and moderate income persons and, incidental to that objective, it properly authorized housing financing for persons of other than low and moderate income. The court concluded that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2.1-398 was not a violation of separation of powers where it merely required the governor's budget to include a capital reserve fund shortfall, for informational purposes only, as an agency request.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot and killed a police officer. He was tried for capital murder. During voir dire, a prospective juror was repeatedly asked if she understood that the state bore the burden of proof. The juror responded several times that defendant bore the burden of proving his innocence. She finally agreed that defendant was innocent until proven guilty. The juror was included in the jury pool. Defendant used a peremptory challenge to remove her. The court reversed defendant's conviction because the juror's attitude manifested a candid reflection of her state of mind concerning defendant's guilt. The juror displayed an attitude so repugnant to a sense of fairness and so indicative of an ingrained and tenacious bias against defendant that no amount of rehabilitation could purge the taint and qualify her as a juror who would stand impartial and free from prejudice. Defendant should not have had to use a peremptory challenge. Refusal to exclude for cause a venireman who believed defendant must prove his innocence was an abuse of discretion and a denial of a defendant's right to an impartial jury. The denial of this right constituted prejudicial error, requiring that the case be retried.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Virginia State Corporation Commission determined that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 38.1-824, requiring that prepaid medical and surgical plans allowed or paid for services rendered by optometrists, opticians, and psychologists, was constitutional. Appellants argued statute was unconstitutional because compliance with it adversely affected their ability to compete with commercial insurance companies. The court held that for appellants to prevail on their due process, equal protection, and impairment of contract objections, they had to prove the statute was not enacted pursuant to a valid exercise of state's police power. The court found that evidence failed to rebut presumption of constitutionality. Also, the court held that statute reasonably accomplished its purpose of increasing availability of mental and eye care services to the public and that it was rationally related to such objective. The court, therefore, found the statute represented a valid exercise of the state's police power, but effects of Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 38.1-347.1, -360, and -824 made statute unconstitutional as applied to appellants for a six-year period following its enactment.</SPAN></P>

Code. Ann. &sect; 38.1-347.1, -360, and -824 made the statute unconstitutional as applied to appellants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The question presented on appeal was whether the city could by ordinance require landowners who possessed adequate water supplies provided by privately owned wells to connect with the municipal water supply system although the ordinance did not require use of the city water. The landowners also argued that the city could not charge connection fees until the landowners elected to use city water. The landowners contended that there was no reasonable relationship between the connection fees and city police power, thus the charges imposed upon the landowners constituted an invalid special assessment. The court affirmed the decree that denied the requested relief. In so ruling, the court determined that the public health purpose alone was sufficient to support the conclusion that the ordinance constituted a valid exercise of city police power. Further, the court found that the charges imposed by the ordinance were fees, not special assessments, and that there was a reasonable correlation between the benefit conferred and the cost exacted.</SPAN></P>

The board authorized the variance on the ground of development in the area. The trial court awarded a writ of certiorari to owners of adjoining lots, reversed the board's decision, and denied the variance. The applicants and board appealed. The court affirmed because the evidence did not support a finding that the zoning restriction on the applicants' ability to build as close to the ocean as the average dwelling in the block constituted unnecessary hardship under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-495(b). The court found that the applicants did not face a hardship approaching confiscation or unreasonable restriction on their use of the land because they could enlarge their house without violating the setback requirement. The court held that the decision was plainly wrong and in violation of the purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance because it authorized the applicants to conform their structure to neighboring nonconforming structures.</SPAN></P>

In a separate action, the representative brought a wrongful death action against separate health care providers, but the trial court held that the action was time-barred. The court consolidated the actions for review because they presented a common issue. The court held that the construction of the language pertaining to the filing of a notice was designed to refer to notices filed not only subsequent to the effective date of the exemption statute but also prior to that date. Therefore, the court held that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8-919, a tolling statute, was triggered in both actions and that the trial courts erred in sustaining the respective pleas of the statute of limitations. The court held that, because the statute of limitations did not run on either claim, it was unnecessary to decide whether the 1978 Curative Paragraph was void because the parties' acquired rights might have been divested retroactively.</SPAN></P>

The trial court upheld defendant's conviction, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. The ordinance used the words &quot;lewd, lascivious, or indecent&quot; to describe the acts that were prohibited, and these words had meanings that were generally understood. A person of reasonable or even limited intelligence would know that the act of sodomy fell within the purview of these types of acts. Therefore, the ordinance was not void for vagueness because it provided fair notice of what conduct was forbidden.

He claimed that the commonwealth should have furnished funding for an independent psychiatrist, that the trial judge should have recused himself, and that it was error to admit at the penalty trial records of convictions that were not final. The court held that the commonwealth had no obligation to provide funding for a psychiatrist of defendant's choosing, that the trial judge's knowledge of background information about defendant gained in other criminal proceedings did not require recusal, and that convictions based on guilty pleas were admissible because a guilty plea that was voluntarily and intelligently tendered waived all defenses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff claimant appealed the decision of the Circuit Court of the City of Radford (Virginia), which sustained the motions to dismiss filed by defendants, two individuals and a clinic (health care providers). At issue was whether the Medical Malpractice Act (Act), Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 8.01-581.1 through 8.01-581.12, applied and whether Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-581.2, which required written notice prior to commencement of the action, applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two years after the alleged incident of medical malpractice took place, the claimant filed the action. However, during those two years, the Act became effective. Under &sect; 8.01-581.2, no action could be brought against a health care provider unless the claimant first notified the health care provider in writing prior to commencing the action. The claimant did not give such notice. However, the court applied the exemption statute,&nbsp;Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-581.12:2 (Supp. 1978), and found that the Act was inapplicable to the action. Therefore, it did not matter that the claimant did not provide the notice required by the Act. Further, because the court reversed the case on that issue, the court did not address whether the Act was unconstitutional. The court found that the express provisions of the Act provided that the Act was intended to have retrospective effect. Therefore, so did the exemption statute, which was enacted after the trial court's dismissal of the claimant's action. The exemption statute was applicable and could be applied because the health care providers had not divested any of their &quot;vested rights&quot; that they had obtained by the trial court's judgment in their favor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the Act was inapplicable to the claimant's case and reversed the dismissal of the action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal the property owners argued that the housing authority did not have the right to condemn their property because the project area was not blighted, a proper environmental impact study was required but had not been prepared, and the proposed taking was unconstitutional because the taking was for a private use. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the burden of proof was on the property owners to have shown by clear and convincing evidence that the finding that the project area was blighted or deteriorated was incorrect. The evidence supported the determination by the housing authority that the area was blighted or deteriorated within the meaning of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 36-49 (Repl. Vol. 1976). The court also determined that the primary public purpose contemplated by the housing authority was the elimination of a blighted or deteriorated area and therefore there was a valid public use. Finally, the court decided that no environmental impact statement was required by the constitution or by any Virginia statute but the evidence supported the trial court's finding that an adequate study had been made.</SPAN></P>

He was found guilty of having violated the county's Unlicensed Automobile License Tax Ordinance and fined. The car owner appealed, arguing the ordinance and its enabling statute, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-27.1, were unconstitutionally applied to him in violation of his rights under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed. The court found that the statute and ordinance were enacted for the legitimate purpose of eliminating &quot;junk&quot; vehicles that were not located in junkyards. The court also found that the ordinance created two classifications--one consisting of car owners whose vehicles were licensed and one consisting of car owners whose vehicles were not licensed. These classifications were not suspect, the court stated, and thus were legitimate if they bore a reasonable relation to the county's objective. The court concluded that the distinction was not unreasonable or arbitrary and was directly related to the ordinance's objective of removing junk vehicles. The court also concluded that a rational basis existed to justify the subclasses created by the ordinance's exceptions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">&nbsp;Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-248 provided, in part, that if a person distributed marijuana only as an accommodation to another individual and not with intent to profit nor to induce the recipient to use or become addicted to the marijuana, then he was guilty of misdemeanor only. The record was completely devoid of any credible evidence that the three sales made by defendant to an undercover officer were intended or believed by defendant to have been anything other than commercial sales of marijuana by a seller to a buyer. The sales were made for money, and there was nothing to suggest that they were made to &quot;accommodate&quot; the police officer. The officer was virtually a stranger to defendant, and defendant could have had only one motive in making the sales and that was to profit. The expression &quot;profit&quot; was used in the statute to indicate a commercial transaction in which there was a consideration involved. It did not necessarily mean that a seller of drugs had to sell his drugs to a buyer at a price in excess of the amount the seller paid for the drugs.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's orders convicting each defendant, holding that the testimony of the commonwealth established that the substance sold to the undercover police officers was marijuana, defendants admitted the sale, and there were no other critical issues involved. The crime was complete and its commission had been established, regardless of the motive or intent of defendant. Only the punishment to be inflicted could have been lessened by a showing of a mitigating circumstance, and it was at that stage that the burden of going forward with the production of some evidence contesting the presumed fact shifted to defendants.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the stated purpose of the Law was to prevent the unnecessary construction or modification of health care facilities in Virginia. The court found that, with the exception of the staff privileges section, all sections of the Law were germane to, and directly concerned, the stated object. The court said that the thrust of the Law was to require that a public need for hospital beds, and other medical facilities, were identified before any construction was undertaken. The court concluded that no member of the General Assembly of Virginia, interested citizen, physician, hospital administrator, or trustee of a hospital board would have suspected from a painstaking examination of the title to the Law that its body contained any provision therein regarding or controlling staff privileges to be accorded physicians.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and entered a final judgment for the landowners. The court stated that section 27-86, under which the city council acted in granting the permit, was fatally defective and invalid because (1) it reserved to the city council the authority to issue a special exception or use permit for the construction of a building in any zoning district in the city whenever, in its sole discretion, such action was justified by public necessity and convenience and the general welfare; (2) the presumption of validity which attached to the ordinance could not prevail against such a patent defect in the face thereof; and (3) the ordinance permitted a lack of adherence by the council to a fundamental rule that zoning regulated the use of land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court ordered execution to issue on its judgment founded on forfeiture of two recognizances totaling $ 50,000 executed by defendant and the surety, which were executed to admit defendant to bail pending appeal of his multiple felony convictions for sexual offenses against minor children. Defendant's petition for a writ of error was refused and certiorari was denied by the United States Supreme Court. While on bail pending appeal, defendant committed three additional felonious sexual offenses against minor children. When the trial court was advised of this it revoked his bail. Defendant appeared before the trial court and entered pleas of guilty to the offenses committed while on bail and was convicted and sentenced to additional prison terms. On review, the court affirmed. The court held that the record showed that the defendant, while on bail, violated the specific good behavior condition of the recognizances by committing additional crimes of the same nature and character as his earlier convictions. The court held that no evidence was adduced by either appellant in explanation, excuse, mitigation or palliation of the principal's flagrant violation of the condition.</SPAN></P>

Appellee contended it had no jurisdiction to pass on the constitutional question, and found appellant in violation.

The court held that appellee, having powers judicial, executive, and legislative under Va. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, had the authority and the obligation to rule on the constitutional issue. The court held that Va.

The property owners further alleged that an adjacent landowner built and erected the storm sewer system, which was dedicated to the board and the board accepted such dedication. The board demurred on the ground that it was immune from actions grounded in tort and on the further ground that the property owners failed to allege facts sufficient to create either an implied-in-fact or implied-at-law contract between the parties. The trial court sustained the demurrer without assigning reasons. The property owners contended error. The court held that the allegations in the property owners' motion were not demurrable because they stated a good cause of action on implied contract.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a corporation that sold auto parts, was charged with a violation of the Closing Law after a police officer purchased a quart of motor oil at one of its stores on a Sunday. Defendant maintained that it was exempt from the Closing Law. The trial court convicted defendant of the offense after a bench trial. It appealed from that judgment, which was affirmed. Section 18.2-341(a)(4) exempted businesses that serviced, fueled, and made emergency repairs to motor vehicles from the Closing Law. That provision also allowed those businesses to sell the parts that were needed to make emergency repairs. The court found that defendant was not covered by &sect; 18.2-341(a)-(4), even though emergency repair items might have comprised 80 percent of its inventory. Therefore, its sale of the motor oil was not incidental to the operation of a retail establishment that was allowed to operate on Sunday. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the Closing Law was discriminatory because other businesses could sell motor oil on Sunday. It also found that defendant was not deprived of equal protection because the authorities in other localities ignored the Closing Law.</SPAN></P>

He was scheduled to die, but the Governor commuted his sentence to life imprisonment, and the court awarded him a writ to consider his allegations of error concerning his convictions. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion for a change of venue. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the attendant publicity was unlikely to influence or inflame the jury. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in excusing a prospective juror who responded affirmatively when asked whether he had any objections to the imposition of capital punishment. The court held that it was not error to excuse the juror for cause since he admitted that he could not impose the death sentence in any proper case. Defendant contended that the mandatory death penalty prescribed by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 53-291 was unconstitutional. The court found that the question of the constitutionality of the death penalty was moot because defendant's life term was substituted validly for a viable sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant published an article regarding a judge who was under investigation for incompetency and identified the judge by name. Defendant contended that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2.1-37.13 was an unconstitutional prior restraint on publication. In affirming the conviction, the court held that the prohibition was constitutionally valid. The court found that &sect; 2.1-37.13 involved subsequent punishment. In subsequent punishment cases, before a state could punish a violation of a restriction upon expression, it had to satisfy the &quot;clear and present danger&quot; test. The court observed that &sect; 2.1-37.13 represented a legislative declaration, fortified by a plain statement of public intent expressed in the Virginia Constitution, that a clear and present danger to the orderly administration of justice would be created by divulgence of the confidential proceedings of the Commission. The sanction imposed sprung from a clear and well-defined legislative declaration that breach of the confidentiality of Commission proceedings was so contrary to the public interest that it constituted a substantive evil of immediate and serious peril to the orderly administration of justice and should be punishable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that the landmark identification process failed to provide the landowners with an appropriate opportunity to be heard. Accordingly, the trial court remanded the matter to the commission with instructions to modify its decision by removing all properties of landowners that had not consented to their inclusion in the historic district. On appeal, the court held that there was no actual, justiciable controversy between the parties. The court reasoned that the commission was not an agency as defined by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 9-6.2 because the general assembly did not authorize the commission to make rules or to adjudicate contested cases. Moreover, the action taken by the commission was neither individual in impact nor condemnatory in purpose because the identification of the area as a landmark did not compel the board to enact any regulation. Although the identification of the district could have conceivably had some incidental effect on the value of the property, there was no evidence that such impact was so direct or immediate as to assume constitutional proportions and to require public hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a habitual offender, had been ordered not to operate a motor vehicle.

Arguing that the statute as applied violated the self-incrimination clauses of the federal and state constitutions, defendant filed a motion to quash the indictment. The trial court denied his motion and the jury found him guilty as charged. Under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.1-387.8, a habitual offender convicted of operating a motor vehicle faced imprisonment. Rejecting defendant's constitutional attack, the court held that even though there was a real possibility of self-incrimination to the &quot;hit and run&quot; habitual offender stemming from enforcement of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.1-176(a), the state's vital interest in its self-reporting system compelled rejection of extending the self-incrimination privilege to the statutory framework.

Summer employees of the defendant complained that they did not receive their final paychecks. At the time of trial, however, all except one complainant had been fully paid the wages due for the period in question. The defendant testified that his inability to promptly meet the last payroll for the summer resulted from the fact that many of his customers who had agreed to pay for his services on a regular basis were in arrears. The defendant contended that Va.

The state contended that the statute did not provide imprisonment merely for unpaid debts but prohibited the deliberate and willful failure or refusal of an employer, when able, to pay employees their regularly scheduled wages.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A citizen argued that the Board of Supervisors of Roanoke County's grant to the city and county of a conditional use permit to operate a sanitary landfill in land that was zoned agricultural was an administrative, not legislative, function of the board; therefore, the grant was arbitrary, unreasonable, or unlawful. The citizen further argued that even if the board had acted in its legislative function, Roanoke County, Va., Code &sect; 21-6 was unconstitutional because it did not provide adequate standards to guide the board in exercising its power; therefore, it violated procedural due process. The trial court upheld the board's grant and found that it was an exercise of its legislative function. The court affirmed, holding that zoning ordinances enacted pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-491 need not include standards concerning issuance of special use permits where local governing bodies were to exercise their legislative judgment or discretion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In filing its questionnaire for county license taxes, the taxpayer erroneously failed to distinguish between retail and wholesale sales and, as a result, overpaid its taxes.

The application was denied, so the taxpayer filed suit against the county. Citing Va. Code &sect; 15.1-554, the county filed a plea in abatement, arguing that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction because the taxpayer had not first presented its claim to the county board of supervisors. The plea was sustained and the taxpayer appealed. In reversing, the supreme court ruled that a claim to the county board under &sect; 15.1-554 was not required because the remedy afforded to an aggrieved taxpayer was that provided by &sect; 58-1145, which granted power to circuit courts to order a correction of assessments and refund of excess taxes paid. Because the taxpayer complied with the procedural requirements of the county code and &sect; 58-1145, the circuit court had jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 1968 Orange County, Virginia zoning ordinance (ordinance) provided that mobile home parks were one of the enumerated uses that may be permitted in an agricultural zone upon the issuance of a conditional use permit by the board.

The board denied the landowners a conditional use permit for a mobile home park on their property in the agricultural zone. The trial court entered a decree in favor of the board, and the court affirmed. The court, noting that the ordinance contained the word &quot;may&quot; and not &quot;shall,&quot; held that the board's decision to refuse the conditional use permit was a reasonable use of the board's discretion over a local matter such as zoning.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 58-151.035 through 58-151.050 subjected the taxpayer to tax on a greater portion of income than was reasonably attributable to its Virginia activities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer was not permitted by the commonwealth to use a separate accounting method for its Virginia operation as an alternative to the statutory method in computing its Virginia corporate income tax. The taxpayer sought a correction of the allegedly erroneous tax assessment under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58-1130. The trial court found for the taxpayer, ruling that the denial of the alternative method had resulted in a tax on income not attributable to business or sources within Virginia. The court reversed, finding that the use of the statutory formula method had not produced a tax on income not reasonably attributable to business in Virginia. The controversy centered around whether the taxpayer's operation in Virginia was part of a nationwide unitary business or whether it was separate so that its profits and losses could be segregated for income taxation. The court found that the taxpayer operated a unitary business because the taxpayer's operation within Virginia was &quot;dependent upon&quot; and &quot;contributory to&quot; its operations outside Virginia. Therefore, the use of a separate accounting method was incompatible with taxation of a multistate corporation conducting a unitary business.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the first part of the ordinance, which prohibited keeping, maintaining, or operating a disorderly house, was considered separate from the remainder of the ordinance. The court affirmed defendant's conviction because the severed portion of the ordinance was valid. It was the intent of the city council to make the keeping, maintaining, or operating of a disorderly house a criminal offense, even though it was included in an ordinance that purported to make other acts criminal offenses. Therefore, the language of the ordinance sufficiently defined the offense charged and was thus constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to convict defendant A of frequenting a disorderly house because the prosecution's evidence showed that defendant A was merely present in the massage parlor and that was not sufficient to support the conviction; (2) the limited scope of the part of the ordinance under which defendant B was charged placed no restriction on the constitutionally protected right of assembly, rather it merely proscribed keeping and maintaining a house where certain unlawful conduct took place; and (3) Norfolk, Va.

Defendant grabbed a guard and reached for his pistol. The other inmate jumped on top of the guard. During the scuffle one of the inmates gained possession of a pistol from one of the guards and fired it several times. The victim ran to the other guard's assistance, but before he reached the struggle, he tripped and fell to the floor. Thereafter, more shots were fired from the gun in the possession of the inmates. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence and held that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 53-291 was not vague and overbroad and that it did not deny defendant due process and equal protection of the law. The court further held that the commonwealth did not have to establish which of the two inmates fired the fatal shots because they were equally responsible for the consequence of the acts of the other.

On appeal, the court held that (1) the landowners had stated a justiciable controversy, so the declaratory judgment action was proper, (2) the landowners failed to show that the zoning was discriminatory, (3) the ordinance's requirements that the landowners dedicate part of their land to the county for a road and maintain public facilities, the demand for which was generated by public traffic rather than the proposed development, violated both the federal and Virginia constitutions as takings without just compensation, (4) the buildable area, commercial use, and architectural design restrictions imposed by the ordinance were beyond the power of the board and the administrator to impose and deprived the landowners of the legitimate use of their property, and (5) the ordinance was not severable, as the portions struck as unconstitutional were crucial to the purpose of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the findings and declaration of the trial court. The court stated that the landowners' evidence showed that their property was suitable for higher-density development. The character of the neighborhood had changed materially from the time the land was placed in its one-acre category. There was a need for housing constructed on sites smaller than permitted under the existing one-acre classification. Public facilities were or soon would be available to serve the land. Also, the land bordered or was nearby other similarly-situated property already zoned for higher-density use. The court held that this evidence was sufficient to neutralize the presumption of reasonableness which attached to the Board's denial of the rezoning requests and to shift to the Board the burden of producing evidence to establish the reasonableness of its zoning action. The court determined that there was no real difference between the landowners' property and nearby properties that were zoned for higher-density use and held that this discriminatory practice was arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

The Attorney General filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to determine whether the bonds met the requirements of &sect; 9(c). The court denied the petition.

There was no authority in the statute under which the Commission was created and functioned for the enactment of rules having the effect of law or for the adjudication of contested cases.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The grantors issued a deed of trust for their house to the trustee to secure a debt owed to beneficiary. When the grantors fell behind on their payments, the beneficiary threatened to foreclose. Before they could completely catch up, the trustee foreclosed on the trust deed and the property was sold to the beneficiary. The beneficiary then sold the house for a profit. The grantor's filed an action to contest the foreclosure and the trial court sustained demurrers by defendants. The court reversed the decision of the trial court as to the beneficiary and found that though the beneficiary had the right to foreclose because of the arrearages he failed to give the grantors notice that he had elected to foreclose. The letter sent to the grantors threatening to foreclose was not sufficient to constitute notice because it was a mere threat and did not affirmatively indicate that the beneficiary had elected to accelerate the debt and foreclose. The court also found that a demurrer was proper as to the trustee because the trustee complied with the requirements of the trust deed in selling the house and because the grantor's claim was only for the profit realized by the beneficiary.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in favor of the developers. The landowners appealed. The court reversed and rendered judgment for the landowners. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional as applied because it permitted one private landowner to take the property of another. The court held that the fact that the easement would at some point become public did not make the easement for a public use because the clear purpose of the easement was the economic benefit of the developers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city alleged that defendant had intentionally exposed himself and urinated on a public street in the presence of others, and thus, charged defendant with indecent exposure, in violation of &sect; 19-44. The trial court convicted defendant of the offense and fined him $ 15 and costs. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that &sect; 19-44, insofar as it prohibited the common law offense of &quot;indecent exposure,&quot; was not vague, overbroad, or otherwise invalid as applied to the conduct of intentionally exposing oneself and urinating on a public street in the presence of others.The severability provision of Charlottesville, Va., City Code &sect; 1-3 saved the indecent exposure provision of Charlottesville, Va., City Code &sect; 19-44, even if other portions of &sect; 19-44 were invalid. Finally, the court held that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 14.1-184, which permitted the trial court to tax defendant for the cost of his court-appointed attorney upon conviction, was not a violation of defendant's constitutional right to court-appointed counsel for indigents.

The trial court convicted him of unlawfully possessing a &quot;sawed-off&quot; shotgun for offensive or aggressive purpose and sentenced defendant to 10 years in prison. The court held that the evidence was insufficient to raise the presumption created by Va.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants were engaged in selling refreshments, food, beer, and wine. To promote its sales, they featured topless female dancers. The dancers' attire consisted of panty hose and a skimpy bottom with nothing above the waist. The dancers' lack of clothing failed to comply with the requirements of a local ordinance. Appellants filed a declaratory judgment suit challenging the validity of an ordinance regulating nude dancing. The trial court held the ordinance to be facially valid. The court affirmed, finding that when nudity was employed as a sales promotion device in bars and restaurants, nudity was conduct. The court held that, as conduct, nudity was as fit a subject for governmental regulation as the licensing of liquor dispensaries and the fixing appellants' closing hours. The court held that because the reasons for the classification in the ordinance were natural and substantial in light of the subject matter and the evil sought to be eliminated, the classification withstood attack as being discriminatory under the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no error in the rulings of the trial court which denied defendant's motion for a change of venue because there was no showing of inflammatory coverage by the news media, no evidence of mass prejudice or hostility toward defendant, and no unusual difficulty in securing an impartial jury.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, however, the court upheld the trial court's judgment that denied the corporation specific performance of the alleged contract. In reaching its decision, the court first noted that the crucial issue in the case turned upon the construction of Danville, Va., Code &sect; 2-17, which provided that no ordinance or resolution selling any public property was valid unless it was passed by three-fourths of the members of the city council. Thereafter, the court stated that the city argued that &quot;any public property&quot; included the shale pit. Thus, the city alleged that since the contract was not approved by three-fourths of the city council, the contract was not enforceable. On the other hand, the corporation argued that &quot;any public property&quot; included only property set aside for use by the general public, which did not include the shale pit. Thus, the corporation argued that the contract was valid. Ultimately, however, the court adopted the city's construction of the statute and concluded that the contract was not enforceable.</SPAN></P>

On remand, the court held that the Virginia obscenity law was not void for overbreadth, that the statute was not void for vagueness because it gave fair notice to defendant of the meaning of obscenity, and that defendant's conviction did not violate the test that the motion picture must have lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the congregation voted to sever its ties with the hierarchical church, the trustees petitioned for the trial court's permission to convey church property. The trial court granted this request, which the hierarchical church argued was improvidently granted. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 57-15, a showing was required that the property conveyance in question was the wish of the constituted authorities of the general church. Thus, the trial court erred in denying the hierarchical church's motion to intervene. The hierarchical church made sufficient allegations to be entitled to have a determination made as to whether it had a proprietary interest in the property in question. The court noted that there was no constitutional prohibition against the resolution of a church property dispute provided that the decision did not depend on any inquiry into church faith or doctrine. The court warned that the hierarchical church was precluded from relying on the implied trust theory on remand and instead had to prove that the trustees violated the deed or some church contractual obligation in the sale of the property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the Virginia State Board of Elections and the Electoral Board of the City of Richmond, sought review of a decree of the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond (Virginia) in favor of appellee candidate, which temporarily enjoined election officials from proceeding with the preparation of ballots and held that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 24.1-111 was unconstitutional to the extent that it grouped candidates for the same office as &quot;independents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The candidate, who was an independent candidate for the House of Delegates from the City of Richmond, was not affiliated with a political party. Pursuant to &sect; 24.1-111, proposed ballots were prepared on which the candidate's name was not separated from the names of two seekers of the same office who were members of an independent party by a large space that was otherwise used to separate political groups from each other. The candidate alleged that &sect; 24.1-111 was unconstitutional in that its effect was to align him on the ballot with members of the Independent Party. On appeal, the court held that the candidate merely showed that there was a possibility that voter confusion could possibly result from the manner in which his name would be placed on the ballot in accordance with &sect; 24.1-111. Because the court did not declare statutes unconstitutional on mere possibilities, the candidate failed to meet his burden of proving that &sect; 24.1-111 was invalid. Therefore, the court held that &sect; 24.1-111 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court declared the statute constitutional, reversed the final decree of the trial court, dissolved the injunction, and dismissed the candidate's bill for declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which the trial court denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was 17 years of age. The juvenile court held that he should be tried as a juvenile.

Defendant was convicted following a bench trial by the corporation court. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed and rejected defendant's attack on the corporation court's jurisdiction. The court found that &sect; 16.1-176(a) and &sect; 16.1-176.1 were not mutually exclusive but complementary because &sect; 16.1-176(a) terminated the juvenile court's jurisdiction under &sect; 16.1-176.1. Section 16.1-176(a) was not unconstitutional as a denial of due process because the grand jury had the discretion to return an indictment or not, and the corporation court following the indictment had discretion to transfer the case back to the juvenile court under Va. Code Ann &sect; 16.1-175 or try defendant as an adult under Va. Code Ann &sect; 16.1-177. Because the juvenile proceedings under &sect; 16.1-176.1 were civil, double jeopardy had not attached and the prosecution under the subsequent grand jury indictment obtained under &sect; 16.1-176(a) was not barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The comptroller argued that the legislation under review was invalid because the loans provided for therein exceed the limitations of Va. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 11. In addition, the comptroller argued that the legislation was unconstitutional because it violated the Establishment and the Free Exercise of Religion Clauses of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The court found that in order for financial aid to be valid as a loan under Va. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 11, it must be repayable either in money or by public service to the Commonwealth. Four of the five alternative methods of repayment set forth in the present legislation failed to meet the test. However, the entire program did not fail because of the severability clauses. The financial aid in the form of loans, repayable either in money or by public employment, to students in sectarian institutions, was appropriate. There was no evidence in the record of the extent of church relationship of the private institutions, which would be eligible to have their students participate in benefits under the Virginia programs. Therefore, the Establishment of Religion Clause of the First Amendment had not been violated.</SPAN></P>

The court explained that the county pursued the new method of adopting annual assessment procedures under which establishment of a department of assessments was not required. The court noted that the piecemeal, segmental assessment methodology that the county employed in implementing the system violated the mandate of Va. Const. &sect; 168 (1902) that all taxes had to be uniform upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax.

The officials did not permit the jurors to see the jury list, and the jurors claimed that the list was a state document and that they were entitled to view it. The circuit court held that &sect;&sect; 8-178(30), 8-182 were not unconstitutional on their face because they did not discriminate against men and that the jurors could not view the jury list. The court held that there were reasonable grounds for classifying women differently than men because women had family responsibilities, and the commonwealth had an interest in the care of those who could not care for themselves. Thus, there was a reasonable basis for the classification, and the statutes passed muster under the equal protection clause. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8-184 (1957 Repl.

Code Ann. &sect; 54-524.101(a) did not, so the statutes were not in irreconcilable conflict and not unconstitutional because they did not prohibit the same offenses by the same class of persons; (2) &sect; 54-524.101(a) was not invalid although it contained an unconstitutional subsidiary provision because the void provision was severable and the substantive provisions were constitutionally valid; (3) the amendment to the form of an indictment was properly made after the defendant pleaded because the nature of the offense remained unchanged; (4) entrapment was not present when an officer merely gave the opportunity for the crime and did not conceive it; (5) an officer could testify as to a telephone conversation that he monitored with the informer's knowledge and consent; and (6) defendant's actions as an intermediary between the informer and the drug supplier placed defendant in constructive possession of the drugs.</SPAN></P>

The unions claimed that the state statute was unconstitutional, that their publication was constitutionally protected free speech, and that the award of damages was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Employees who were not members of unions were identified in a union newsletter and described in derogatory terms. The employees brought an action against the unions under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8-630, the insulting words statute, and were awarded compensatory and punitive damages. On review, the unions claimed that the insulting words statute was unconstitutional because it was vague and overbroad and infringed on the right of free speech protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The court found that the public interest in free expression was outweighed in this case by the protection of the employees from damage to their reputations and social relationships. The court further found that the decision of the employees as to whether or not to join the union was a private matter. Under the applicable state law, the employees only needed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the statements of the unions were made with actual malice. The statements were not protected by the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board argued that the power company was not entitled to have appealed from the adverse ruling of boards of supervisors denying abandonment and that the abandonment of the roads and bridges was an unconstitutional taking of public and private property without just compensation. The court affirmed the judgments ordering the abandonment of the highways. The court explained that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 33.1-152 provided that petitioners and the state highway commission were authorized to have appealed decisions of the board. The court reasoned that any landowner of a county became a &quot;petitioner&quot; by filing with its governing body a petition for the abandonment of a road. The court found no unconstitutional taking of the property because proceedings for the abandonment of the roads and bridges in question were properly conducted under appropriate sections of the Virginia code before the boards of supervisors of the two counties and in the lower courts. The court explained that if the power company wanted to have acquired that property, it would have had to pay just compensation as it must have done for any other property acquired by it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant had coal worker's pneumoconiosis. The claimant had worked for the employer on two occasions. Before being rehired, the claimant underwent a medical examination and was found to have had a condition consistent with silicosis. The claimant signed two waivers for compensation. The commission held that his claim was barred by the two waivers executed pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 65-50. The claimant argued that the waivers were only effective to bar a claim for silicosis. The court affirmed the denial, holding that the evidence showed that silicosis and coal worker's pneumoconiosis were diseases of the lungs resulting from exposure to dust, and only a study of the history of exposure would permit a doctor to make an educated guess as to which disease was present. The evidence showed the condition consistent with silicosis would have been just as consistent with the disease known as coal worker's pneumoconiosis. Thus, the claimant entered into voluntary waivers of his right to benefits for aggravation of this condition. Because of the waivers the statutory right to compensation benefits for aggravation of the claimant's condition was waived and never came into being.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for the County of Fairfax (Virginia), which convicted defendant for possession of marijuana, a controlled drug, with intent to distribute it, in violation of Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that a conviction of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute could be based solely upon evidence as to quantity. The trial court based this instruction on the subsidiary provision of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 54-524.101(a). On appeal, defendant contended that the subsidiary statutory provision was void because it was unconstitutionally vague, uncertain, and ambiguous. The court held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because a person of ordinary intelligence in possession of a quantity of marijuana could not with reasonable certainty know whether he was guilty of the misdemeanor of mere possession or the felony of possession with intent to distribute. The court also found that the statutory inference or presumption of possession with intent to distribute did not have sufficient rational connection with the fact of possession of a quantity of a controlled drug. The court reversed the trial court's judgment because the subsidiary provision of &sect; 54-524.101(a) was unconstitutional, but remanded the case for a new trial because the court's holding did not affect the validity of the substantive offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant did not dispute the fact of possession but challenged the constitutionality of the statutes. On appeal, the court held that Code &sect; 18.1-268.3 prohibited unlawful possession or use of a sawed-off shotgun for an offensive or aggressive purpose and that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.1-268.4 contained a rebuttable presumption of such purpose if the weapon was not registered or if the possessor had been convicted of a crime of violence. The court held that the term &quot;offensive or aggressive&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague because a person of ordinary intelligence would know the meaning of the terms from their ordinary usage and could determine the crime with reasonable certainty. The court found that the evidentiary presumption was valid because it had a rational connection with the facts and circumstances proved. The court also held that the registration statute was not per se unconstitutional.

</DIV>

R. 1:5(4)(d) was unconstitutional. The district court abstained from review, and the court granted petitioner leave to petition for reconsideration of his application and consideration of the constitutional argument raised. The court found that Virginia distinguished between those attorneys licensed by examination, governed by Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 54-60 to -66, and those licensed without examination. As to the first class, there was no requirement of a preadmission showing of intent to practice full time as a member of the Virginia bar but, as to the second class, the requirement was imposed. The court held that there was a rational connection between the requirement with the qualification of capacity to practice. The court found that a later action of the United States Supreme Court sustained this view. Therefore, the court held that the rule was valid.</SPAN></P>

Sup. Ct. R. 1A:1(4)(c), formerly Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:5(4)(c), but that application was refused because petitioner was not a state resident. Petitioner attacked the constitutionality of this rule in the district court and was permitted to file a motion for reconsideration with the state supreme court. Upon reconsideration, the court again refused petitioner's application, holding that Virginia could constitutionally require that an applicant for admission to its bar without examination be a resident of that state as a prerequisite to admission. The court found that the residency requirement was neither arbitrary, discriminatory, nor unreasonable because it applied to all those seeking admission to the bar, whether with or without examination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a writ of error to the judgment was granted, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that state statutes which authorized discretionary imposition of the death penalty offended the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. The court found no error in the guilty verdict. The investigating officers and the trial judge, at every stage of the proceedings, practiced every procedural safeguard and honored every substantive right which the law made available to a suspect and an accused. The court found that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.1-22 provided that murder of the first degree was punishable with death, or by confinement in the penitentiary for life, or for any term not less than 20 years. The court held that insofar as &sect; 18.1-22 authorized discretionary imposition of the death penalty, it was unconstitutional. The Commonwealth urged that the court had the power, without remanding the case, to modify the jury's verdict and impose the lawful maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Without deciding the extent of its authority to modify a judgment, the court remanded the issue of punishment for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of the City of Waynesboro (Virginia) entered an order reducing the assessments complained of by directing that the real estate be divided into two parcels and ordering the assessment of each parcel at a reduced valuation per square foot.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city contended that the land was not assessed at more than its fair market value and that there was no evidence of lack of uniformity in application of the assessment, which justified the corrective action taken by the trial court. The court agreed, noting that the landowner failed to produce probative evidence of lack of uniformity in application of the assessments to comparable properties. The court found that the city, on the other hand, produced evidence affirmatively showing uniformity. Next, the city challenged the constitutionality of the portion of the 1968 amendment to &sect; 58-1145, which permitted adjustments if the court in its discretion found that the ends of justice would be met by making an adjustment. The court determined that the challenged provision was unconstitutional because it was vague and overbroad. The court struck the challenged provision from the statute and concluded that with the deletion, the city's motion to strike the landowner's evidence at the conclusion of the evidence should have been granted. Accordingly, the court reversed the trial court's order and entered final judgment for the city.</SPAN></P>

The proceedings were instituted when the comptroller, in letters to the attorney general, expressed doubt as to the validity of certain provisions of the Acts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the Acts at issue did not violate the proscription imposed by the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. I. Nor did the acts violate the Equal Protection clause of the U.S. Const. by unreasonably discriminating against certain classes of students. The case did not involve so-called &quot;suspect&quot; classifications or classifications touching &quot;fundamental&quot; rights. Therefore, the appropriate standard of review was a rational basis. The court found that there was a rational basis for the classifications delineated in the Acts. However, the court determined that the Acts provided for conditional grants or gifts and not loans within the context and meaning of that term as used in Va. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 11. Despite the court's view that the &quot;loans&quot; in question were gifts or grants, the court indicated that it might nevertheless validate so much of the program in Chapter 19 as provided financial aid to students attending non-sectarian institutions if that part of the statute were severable. However, the court found that the statute was not severable. The court concluded that the Acts violated art. VIII, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 18.1-163. Defendant was sentenced to have served a term of three years in the state penitentiary. Defendant's appeal was ground on the proposition that &sect; 18.1-163 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that &sect; 18.1-163 violated the due process provisions of the U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV and Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 (1971). Section 18.1-163 was set out in full in the opinion and entitled &quot;failure to return such animal, aircraft, vehicle, or boat&quot; resulting in a larceny conviction. Defendant argued that the failure of &sect; 18.1-163 to have required mens rea or scienter was fatal. The court, on review, stated that the distinction between larceny after bailment and the common law offense of larceny was that in the former it was not necessary to have alleged or proved that the original taking was trespassory. The court held that a claim that a statute on its face contained no requirement of mens rea or scienter was no ground for holding the statute unconstitutional because such requirement would have been read into the statute by a court when it appeared that the legislature implicitly intended that it must have been proven.</SPAN></P>

The jury instruction regarding the police officer's withdrawal from the fight erroneously did not include the requirement that the withdrawal had to be in good faith and disclosed to the bar owner. Another instruction wrongly stated that a police officer had the right to use a club in effecting an arrest if the circumstances required. The jury was to decide if a club was warranted. The failure to prosecute the bar owner although he had been charged in the brawl properly was not admitted into evidence because it was not relevant to the action.

A section of Falls Church, Va., Ordinance 510 was held unreasonably restrictive, but the section was severable and the remainder of the ordinance was held valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Falls Church, Va., Ordinance 512 made it unlawful to operate a massage salon where services were rendered to a customer by a person of the opposite sex. Falls Church, Va., Ordinance 510 regulated the operation of health clubs, massage salons, bath parlors and similar establishments. The massage salon owners contended on appeal that the ordinances were invalid because they were inconsistent with state statutes; they deprived massage salon owners of property rights without due process of law and denied them and their employees equal protection of the law; and they were discriminatory in that barber shops are excluded from their operation. The court affirmed the lower court's decree. The court ruled that, in light of the inherent character of the subject matter and the evil sought to be eliminated, the reasons for the classifications created by the ordinances under attack were natural and substantial. The ordinances could not be invalidated as creating arbitrary or unreasonable classifications. The ordinances, to the extent upheld by the lower court, were within the proper exercise of the city's police power.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected all four grounds for claimed obscenity and upheld the ruling below. Noting that obscene materials were not entitled to First Amendment protection, the court rejected a claim that a jury trial was required in a suit brought under &sect; 18.1-236.3 because it was not in force when the U.S. Constitution as adopted. The court declined to determine whether the statutory provision for a temporary restraining order rendered the statute an unconstitutional prior restraint because no such order was issued herein. Holding that the proper standard for judging obscenity was a community standard, the court noted that there was sufficient evidence that the material was obscene under such standards. Nor was the statute unconstitutional by reason of vagueness because it provided a definite procedure for determining whether materials alleged to be obscene were in fact obscene.

Code &sect; 18.1-173 (1960) applied to both public and private property. The court found that what was denied to defendants, and all that was denied to them, was the right to demonstrate by a &quot;sit-in&quot; specifically in the administration building. It was thus not the right to protest but the place of protest that was regulated. The court held that defendants had no constitutional right to been in or to have remained in the administration building on the night of the vigil. The court stated that the circuit court had correctly and fully advised the jury respecting defendants' right not to testify. The court held that a greater sentence in the second trial in the circuit court was not an indication of vindictiveness because their appeal was not predicated or dependent on error in the trial in the county court and was thus de novo.</SPAN></P>

While holding that defendant committed a public act, as required by statute, and that there was credible evidence that the vest was made from an American flag, the court ruled that the Commonwealth had not shown that defendant &quot;defiled&quot; a flag, as required by the statute.

The court also rejected the owner's contention that because of the high value of the car, the forfeiture in his case did constitute an excessive punishment.

Real Estate Comm'n. R. II(16).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the Commission suspended the broker's license for violating Rule II(16), the broker appealed to the trial court. A jury found the broker guilty of violating the rule, and the trial court affirmed the suspension. The broker then sought a writ of error contending that the rule which he violated was unconstitutional because the term &quot;improper dealing&quot; as used in the rule was so vague and indefinite that it violated due process. The court reversed. The court found held that, under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 54-762(10), &quot;improper dealing&quot; was not the sole standard provided for revoking or suspending a license. &quot;Improper dealing&quot; was restricted to conduct which involved moral culpability and which tended to take an unfair advantage of the person with whom the actor dealt. The court, therefore, held that &sect; 54-762(10) was a valid exercise of the Commission's police power. However, the court reached a different conclusion with respect to Va. Real Estate Comm'n. R. II(16). An offer to repurchase, standing alone, was not an act which involved moral culpability nor was it an act closely akin to fraudulent or dishonest dealing. Thus, Rule II(16) was an invalid application of Code &sect; 54-762(10).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was found guilty of statutory rape and sentenced to death. He instituted a habeas corpus proceeding in which the trial court held that veniremen opposed to a death sentence were improperly excluded as jurors at the inmate's trial. By an order, the trial court directed that the inmate be retried on the issue of punishment alone or be released from custody. The inmate challenged the order, contending that he should have been retried on the issue of guilt as well as punishment. Affirming, the court held that the trial court was authorized to reconsider punishment alone where, under newly-announced constitutional principles, the felon's sentence had been set aside not because the jury that tried him could not have constitutionally found him guilty, but because the jury as then constituted could not have constitutionally imposed the death sentence. The court concluded that if the inmate was retired on the issue of punishment, so much of the transcript of the evidence adduced at the inmate's first trial may have been read in open court as was reasonably necessary to show the nature of the offense charged and the circumstances under which it was committed.</SPAN></P>

The corporations challenged a decree of the Circuit Court for the City of Virginia Beach (Virginia), which was in favor of the city in each case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city demurred on the ground that the corporations had an adequate remedy at law. The trial court had overruled the demurrers. In a distinguishable case, the court declared invalid Virginia Beach, Va., City Ordinance No. 105, under which two of the corporations paid their fee. However, the city amended its charter to permit it to establish and collect such fees as determined by the city council to be reasonable for the rendering of special services and, pursuant to that authority, re-enacted and re-ordained Ordinance No. 105. The court found it unnecessary to discuss the corporations' assignments of error because it found that the trial court was in error in overruling the demurrers. The power of declaratory judgments was not to be exercised where some other mode of proceeding was provided. The corporation's petitions' were seeking a money judgment for a certain sum, not any guide to the parties regarding their future conduct. The corporations' remedy for a refund of fees was by a motion for judgment, not by a petition for declaratory judgment. Therefore, the court determined that the trial court should have sustained the city's demurrers and dismissed the petitions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, members of an unruly crowd, were arrested, tried, and convicted of violating the state's anti-riot statute. The statute provided that any persons who obstructed the free passage of others on public or private property and who failed to stop the obstruction when asked to do so by the owner, lessee, or law enforcement official, were guilty of a misdemeanor. The statute also provided that when persons assembled with the intent to do an unlawful act that would be a riot if committed or when they assembled for the purpose of disturbing the peace, their assembly was unlawful. Defendants argued that their convictions were unlawful because the statute violated the First Amendment's guarantee to the right of assembly. The court explained that, at common law, rout, riot, and disturbance of the peace were punishable only when a clear and present danger of violent conduct had occurred. By contrast, the statute included assemblies that posed no clear and present danger. The statute was overbroad and unconstitutional. The court reversed the convictions and dismissed the actions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant petitioned for a writ of error and supersedeas, arguing that the Habitual Offender Act, Va.

The court stated that the constitutional prohibition against an ex post facto law applied to criminal proceedings and not to civil proceedings. A proceeding to revoke an automobile driver's permit or license was a civil and not a criminal proceeding. The evidence was undisputed that defendant was convicted of four separate offenses specified in &sect; 46.1-387.2 within a 10-year period.

The trial court agreed but held that the remainder of the statute was valid; thus overruled the motion. The court reversed the conviction. The court agreed with the trial court that the remainder of the statute was valid because the last sentence was severable from the remainder of the statute where it was added by an amendment and the statute was complete without the last sentence. However, the court held that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction because the Commonwealth did not submit sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that the items appealed to the prurient interest, affronted community standards, or were utterly without redeeming social value.

When the prisoner was not allowed to appeal his conviction, the trial court granted his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that it was error for the trial court to award the writ. The prisoner was sentenced in proceedings devoid of jurisdictional questions to a term within the range fixed by law pursuant to a judgment of conviction based on a plea of guilty voluntarily and intelligently entered. That plea waived all defenses other than those jurisdictional. The court concluded that because the conviction had been rendered upon a voluntary guilty plea and the punishment fixed by law was imposed in a proceeding free of jurisdictional defect, there was nothing to appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In its declaratory judgment suit against defendant zoning administrator, plaintiff automobile dealer appealed from the decree of the Circuit Court of Arlington County (Virginia), which upheld the validity of Arlington County, Va., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 26(B), which prohibited advertising by means of outdoor moving signs or devices, and denied the dealer an injunction restraining the enforcement of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dealer was concerned with the application of the zoning ordinance to the display of pennants around the exterior of its automobile sales lots. The pennants were small strips of colored plastic, either rectangular or triangular in shape, suspended from a string or cord and fluttered by the stirring of the wind. The court affirmed the decree of the trial court, and held that because the dealer's argument that the ordinance prohibited the devices in question from being displayed throughout the county, without regard to their distance or ability to be seen from a public thoroughfare, did not show injury to the dealer, it was not a valid ground upon which the dealer could rely. The ordinance was not unreasonable and arbitrary and it was within the scope of the county's police power to regulate such advertising in the interest of public safety. Even if it were assumed that aesthetic considerations entered into the reason for the enactment of the ordinance, that did not show that the ordinance was based solely on aesthetics. Section 26B enacted under the police power of the county was valid.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction because the evidence on behalf of the commonwealth, which the jury accepted, was sufficient to warrant the finding that defendant inflicted the child's wounds and bruises. The punishment that defendant inflicted on the child was unreasonable and excessive. The evidence fully supported that finding. There was nothing in the language of Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16.1-132 or 16.1-136 which excluded evidence of statements or admissions made by an accused while testifying in the inferior court. Defendant's statements in the county court that he had spanked the child were made while he was testifying in his own behalf. Therefore, the statement was admissible.

On appeal, defendant argued that the conviction was void because the statute, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.1-365, did not apply to city streets. Defendant further argued that the Commonwealth failed to prove a lack of permission and that the statute was unconstitutional. Essentially, defendant argued that because the statute was a criminal statute, it had to be strictly construed and that any extension beyond its words by implication or construction was forbidden. The court agreed with defendant. The court pointed out that a penal statute, like the one in this case, had to be strictly construed and that it could not be extended by implication or interpreted to embrace cases that were not within its letter or spirit. The court rejected the Commonwealth's argument that the word &quot;another&quot; as used in the statute meant &quot;another person&quot; and that a municipality was a person. The court found that the words &quot;on the property of another&quot; did not refer to the sidewalks of a city.

He was tried in the county court and acquitted of the charge, but was found guilty of impaired driving. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the warrant because the terms of the impaired driving statute did not permit his prosecution in the circuit court upon a charge of impaired driving. He contended that he could not be prosecuted or convicted for a violation of &sect; 18.1-56.1 except as a lesser included offense of a prosecution for violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.1-54. The court affirmed, finding that &sect; 18.1-56.1 did not permit an interpretation that required automatic dismissal of every charge of impaired driving reaching a court of record on appeal. The court found that the language of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.1-56.1 made it clear that impaired driving was a lesser included offense included within the driving under the influence statute.

The circuit court denied the request to appoint counsel and then denied the writ. The court reversed the circuit court's denial of writ and remanded the case for a plenary hearing. The court held that while there was no Constitutional requirement that the inmate have counsel appointed for him for a habeas proceeding, the nature and contents of the relief sought and the basis of the error or defect charged may require such an appointment. Here, the nature of the proceeding involved not only the constitutionality and application of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 53-296, but also the issue of adequate and effective assistance of counsel.

Moreover, the trial court did not err in admitting a sheriff's testimony regarding his observations inside defendant's motel room because sheriff merely testified as to wounds he noticed on defendant's head. There was entry by invitation, and there was no search, seizure, or arrest that would have required a warrant. Va.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2.1-64.4 to 2.1-64.14 (Act) to aid in the development of the economy. The comptroller stated that he would not honor the Authority's vouchers because there was an issue of the constitutionality of the statute. The attorney general sought a writ of mandamus. The court denied the writ of mandamus and held that the statute was unconstitutional as violative of the credit clause contained in Va. Const. &sect; 185. The court held that the appropriation by the legislature of funds to the guaranty fund, pursuant to Va. Code &sect; 2.1-64.12, combined with the guaranty by the Authority of loans for industrial projects based upon the strength of the guaranty fund, constituted a granting of the credit of the State to or in aid of a person, association, or corporation, in violation of Va. Const. &sect; 185. The avowed objective of the Act and the intended result to be achieved by the functioning of the Authority was to enable private firms to obtain loans upon the strength of the publicly underwritten credit of a political subdivision of the State when upon their own credit such firms could not obtain the same loans for themselves.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 15.1-1373 to 15.1-1390 (1964 Repl. Vol.). The authority also sought a writ requiring respondent, chairman of the Authority, to execute documents including an indenture and a lease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The authority proposed to construct and lease a plant to a manufacturer with the costs financed by revenue bonds authorized by the indenture. After a review of the act, the court rejected the chairman's arguments that certain provisions violated the state constitution. Instead, the court held that the delegation of power by the legislature to local governing bodies to create industrial authorities as a political subdivision of the state, rather than as a creation of the legislature, was not violative of the constitution. Nevertheless, the court held that one section in particular, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-1382, which provided for the payment of a fixed sum in lieu of taxes, was unconstitutional and that the portion of the lease purporting to implement &sect; 15.1-1382 was invalid. The court held, in part, that &sect; 15.1-1382 had the effect of exempting the lessee of industrial authority property from the payment of a leasehold interest tax. Thus, ultimately, the court denied the writ of mandamus and held that the chairman could not be required to sign the lease because it contained a void provision, nor could he be required to sign the indenture because it was contingent on a valid lease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the writ of mandamus after holding that a portion of the Act violated the Virginia constitution and therefore the chairman could not be required to sign the indenture or the lease.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The voters' petition contained the signatures of 1,433 allegedly qualified voters.

The circuit court overruled the objector's exceptions to the report, confirmed the report, and ordered the election pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-698. On appeal, the court affirmed the order directing the election by finding that the objectors failed to establish the invalidity of the petition. The court held that it was permissible for a petitioner's name to be signed by another only if authorized by him and done in his presence. Even by eliminating the 22 signatures procured on the petition for persons not in the circulator's presence, more than 15 percent of the qualified voters properly petitioned for a special election as provided in &sect; 15.1-98.

The trial court dismissed the leaseholder's action for correction of the allegedly erroneous assessments, finding that the statute was constitutional and the leasehold interest was assessed at fair market value. The court affirmed, holding that the statute was not an unconstitutional tax on the land and building owned by the commonwealth in violation of Va. Const. &sect; 183(a), but merely a tax on the leasehold interest. The leaseholders did not overcome the &quot;clear presumption&quot; in favor of the correctness of the assessor's determination because the assessment was less than they paid for the leasehold interest and less than the assessed value calculated from the &quot;fair economic rent&quot; propounded by the leaseholders' expert.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners alleged that the road provided the sole means of access from their property to a main highway, that the road had deteriorated to the point of becoming unusable, and that the discontinuance of the road was a nullity because the landowners had not received notice and a hearing pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 33-76.7. The court held, however, that &sect; 33-76.7 did not require notice to interested landowners and provided only for notice to the local governing body involved. A hearing to ascertain whether a secondary road should be discontinued was not necessary unless requested by the local governing body. The county board of supervisors had requested the discontinuance; hence, notice and hearing were not required. Because discontinuance of a road did not eliminate it as a public road or render it unavailable for public use, the landowners still had a public road available for access to their property. The discontinuance of a road was a discretionary matter. Highway officials, when exercising such discretion, acted in a legislative and not in a judicial capacity.

The fact that the authority proposed to issue revenue bonds for the financing and construction of an industrial facility to be leased to a private user did not make ch. 643 unconstitutional because the public purpose would be served by the industrial development.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the evidence established a decline in the economy surrounding the particular area and the city housing authority's decision to condemn property was not arbitrary or unwarranted. The findings that real estate tax revenues and business receipts had suffered, and that the number of licensed business in the area had declined substantially, supported the trial court's decision to dismiss the landowner's motion. This evidence supported the trial court's holding that the housing authority's finding of blight was not arbitrary or unwarranted. The court therefore committed no error in dismissing the property owners' bill of complaint. Further, the court held that the Virginia Housing Authorities Law was constitutional and that the standards enunciated in requiring a finding of blight and deterioration, were neither vague, abstract, nor insufficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was assessed with costs related to the clerk's requirement of reporting his speeding conviction to the Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles. Defendant argued that &sect; 14.1-200.1 was unconstitutional. Defendant contended that it was a tax because the general assembly intended to impose a tax and the assessments provided for were outside the legitimate bounds of costs. Affirming, the court held that &sect; 14.1-200.1 on its face provided for the imposition of costs, therefore, there was no occasion to resort to legislative history to explain its meaning. The court found that the costs assessed thereunder were directly related to the record-keeping and reporting expenses related to convictions for traffic offenses. The court found that the fact that the collected costs constituted a new source of revenue for highway purposes did not contradict the fact that the State had been reimbursed thereby for an expense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The municipality sought to condemn the real property of appellee property owners. The court held that there was no restriction in the Rudee Inlet Authority Act to the effect that the sale or leasing of the land condemned by the municipality for public use shall only be in furtherance of or incidental to the main purpose of the act or no loner needed for the public use. Under the powers conferred by the act, the municipality could acquire private property by condemnation one day and the next day lease or sell it unconditionally, or on such terms and conditions as it deemed proper to a private party. Any such unconditional lease or sale would have been, in effect, the exercise of the power of eminent domain for private use, not public use and would have been repugnant to the fundamental principle of eminent domain that private property may be taken by the state only for public use. Thus, the powers of eminent domain granted to the municipality went beyond constitutional limitations. Accordingly, the court affirmed the dismissal of the petition for condemnation.</SPAN></P>

The court observed that laws forbidding the intermarriage of the races were within the state's police power and stated that the state had an overriding interest in the institution of marriage. The court held that Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 20-58 and 20-59 did not violate the Virginia or the United States Constitutions. The court found that defendants' suspended sentences had the effect of banishing them from the state and banishment was prohibited by public policy. The court noted that as the purpose of Va.

The court disagreed and held that the mere retroactivity of a statute affecting taxation did not render it unconstitutional. Such a statute was valid if it was not arbitrary and did not disturb vested rights, impair contractual obligations, or violate due process. The court found no disturbance of vested rights. The pipeline corporation did not have a vested right to be free of taxation, and it did not have the constitutional right to know that a tax would be levied in such a manner so that it could be avoided. The retroactive operation of the amended statute was within the current year and within three months of the date on which the statute became effective. Such retroactive operation did not extend for more than a reasonable period, nor was it so harsh and oppressive as to transgress the constitutional limitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An amusement park had a fire, and it argued that because fire trucks were delayed by moving trains blocking traffic at a crossing for an estimated 15 minutes, the fire damage was greater than it should have been. The amusement park argued that the railroad violated a local ordinance, Norfolk, Va., City Code &sect; 28-86 (1950), which required trains not to block a crossing for more than eight minutes, and thus the railroad was guilty of negligence per se. The trial court disagreed and entered a summary judgment. On review, the court held that the ordinance had to be interpreted as applying only to standing trains for two reasons. First, the language of the ordinance supported such an interpretation. Second, if the ordinance were applied to moving trains, then it would violate the Commerce Clause by controlling the length of trains. The ordinance would then impermissibly hinder the free flow of commerce between the states, each of which could have different requirements regarding train lengths if such state or local regulations were permitted. The court held that it had to interpret the ordinance so that remained lawful if at all possible, so it had to apply only to standing trains.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insured sought recovery of an $ 85,000 judgment against the owner of an uninsured vehicle and the driver who struck him under the uninsured motorist clauses of two separate bodily injury liability policies issued by the insurer. The two policies had limits of $ 10,000 each. The insurer paid the insured under the father of the insured's policy and refused to pay under the insured's policy because his limit did not exceed his father's limit. The trial court sustained the insurer's plea and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court held that the insured's policy violated Va.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner citizen filed in the court an action against respondents, secretary and State Board of Elections (board), seeking a writ of mandamus, challenging the state's apportionment of Congressional districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizen argued that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 24-3 (1950) of the Redistricting Act of 1952 (Act), which apportioned the state into 10 Congressional districts, violated Va. Const. &sect; 55. The largest district contained 527,098 people and the smallest contained 312,890 people. The court held that the Act was unconstitutional because it did not meet the requirements of &sect; 55 that the districts contain as nearly as practicable an equal number of inhabitants. Certain discrepancy in the populations was allowed due to the state's commitment to not divide a county or city into separate districts. Also, &sect; 55 required that districts be composed of contiguous territory. The court refused to exclude military personnel in determining whether the apportionment was proper. But as to some of the districts, there was not even an approximately equal population. The apportionment violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, which required that one person's vote was worth as much as that of another. Also, the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, required equal participation by all voters. History, economics, or group interests alone did not allow for deviation from the population principle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court issued the writ of mandamus as requested by the citizen in his challenge to the state's apportionment of Congressional districts. The court ordered that the board conduct only elections at large in all future elections until the state enacted a constitutionally valid reapportionment act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The railway owned land that was adjacent to its tracks. It improved the land with the intention of building a switching yard. The city agreed with local resident that the construction violated &sect; 39-12(9) and informed the railway. The city amended &sect; 39-12(9) to more clearly prohibit certain transportation facilities in residential districts. On the railway's challenge, the trial court sustained the validity of &sect; 39-12(9). On appeal, the court reviewed the legislative history of &sect; 39-12(9) and prior zoning regulations and held that the amendment was not mere &quot;window dressing&quot; to deprive the railway of its rights. The railway failed to prove that the switching yard, in the proposed residential location was necessary for its performance of its public duties. The court rejected the railway's assertion that &sect; 39-12(9) was unreasonable and arbitrary, holding that the defendants' evidence established that the residential property was valuable and that the switching yard would depreciate the value of the property. Section 39-12(9) had not deprived the railway of all the land's value because the city offered to purchase the land for a recreational park.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with unlawfully failing to yield the right of way. The traffic court convicted defendant, but defendant appealed to the trial court. Before a judgment was entered, the state filed a plea of nolle prosequi. Then, defendant was charged with unlawfully operating a motor vehicle in a reckless manner. Defendant filed a plea in bar, alleging a double jeopardy violation based on Va. Const. &sect; 8. The trial court reserved its ruling. A jury found defendant guilty. Defendant filed a motion to set aside the verdict. The trial court denied the motion. The court affirmed on appeal, holding that defendant was not put twice in jeopardy for the same offense when he was prosecuted for the separate and distinct offense of reckless driving. The court reasoned that a single occurrence constituted two distinct offenses for which defendant was prosecuted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayer filed a motion for a declaratory judgment against defendants, members of the city council who were also federal employees, challenging the constitutionality of City of Falls Church, Va., Charter &sect; 20.14, which permitted federal employees to serve as officers of the city, contrary to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2-27. The Circuit Court of Fairfax County (Virginia) ruled for the city council members. The taxpayer appealed from that judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bill alleged that the city council members were ineligible of holding office on the council because of the provisions of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2-27, and prayed that their offices be declared vacant from the date that each city council member undertook to enter upon the duties of the office. The city council members filed a joint answer, asserting their eligibility to hold office because of the provisions of City of Falls Church, Va., Charter &sect; 20.14. The trial court ruled that the disputed charter section was valid. The taxpayer contended that the provision of the city charter was a special act, at variance with and amendatory to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2-27; and that such special legislation was forbidden by Va. Const. &sect; 64. The court held that the city charter provision was a valid legislation, enacted for the organization and government of the city, so as to permit the city council members to escape the ban imposed by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2-27. The court noted that Va. Const. &sect; 117 gave to the legislature the power to enact laws for the organization and government of one city which differed from those enacted for another city, and which it might be powerless to enact specially for a county.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that there was no provision in the statute which expressly required that the arresting officer advise him of his rights to request a blood test within two hours, to have a physician of his choice extract the blood, or to know the results of the test. The court held that the provisions were directory and that the officer's actions did not constitute a lack of compliance. The court found that there was sufficient evidence presented for the jury to conclude that the instruments used by the physician was properly sterilized before extracting defendant's blood.

The camp operator assigned cross-error to the overruling of his demurrer based on claims that the ordinance was unconstitutional, vague and indefinite, and not authorized because a town had a similar ordinance. The court affirmed the trial court's order in part with respect to the overruling of the demurrer, reversed in part as to the holding that the ordinance was invalid as a revenue measure, and remanded the case for the entry of a judgment in favor of the county. The court concluded that the ordinance was a valid enactment. The court found that the county clearly had the right to levy a revenue license tax under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 35-64.1.

Defendant contended that Va.

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction by holding that &sect; 56-426 was a valid and constitutional legislative enactment. Section 56-426 reasonably informed defendant of what had to be done or avoided to escape criminal prosecution by using commonly understood language in everyday usage. The statute was not unconstitutional merely because the legislature failed to prescribe the precise method by which a common, everyday task such as ridding land of weeds, grass, and decayed timber was to be performed. By requiring that only such area be cleared as was necessary to abate the danger of fire, the legislature provided a flexible, rather than a vague, standard designed to meet the exigencies of each situation and, thus, substantially related its action to the public safety.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A declaratory action filed by the county school board and superintendent against several individuals and the state board and superintendent resulted in a determination by the trial court that the Commonwealth of Virginia had no obligation to establish, maintain or operate public free schools in the county. The trial court determined that the county board had performed all the duties required and had not acquiesced in the refusal of the board of supervisors to levy taxes for public school purposes, nor had the state board. The state board had no power or duty to maintain or operate public free schools, and in fact could not have passed on funds appropriated by the General Assembly until matching funds were provided by the board of supervisors. State scholarships were not conditioned upon the operation of public schools, and expenditure of state funds for upkeep of high schools was in violation of the Constitution. Upon review, the court affirmed and held that because of the refusal of the county board of supervisors to appropriate funds, the public free schools were closed. The Constitution did not mandate the General Assembly then take over the schools and operate them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the NAACP had a constitutionally protected liberty interest and a right to freedom of association that protected the names of its donors from disclosure, absent a compelling state interest in the disclosure. The state committee argued that disclosure was justified based on its interest in obtaining correct income tax returns. The court held that the committee had failed to show a compelling state interest in obtaining correct income tax returns, given that 60 percent of Virginia taxpayers used a &quot;short form&quot; on which there was a standard charitable deduction, and given the evidence that donations for the four years in question totalled only $ 16,610, resulting in a maximum loss of revenue to the government of $ 830.

The counties appealed the annexation orders, and the city filed cross-appeals. The court overruled the city's cross-appeals as to both counties by refusing to adopt the &quot;growback&quot; theory, as contended for by the city. As to one county, the court affirmed the order of annexation because it found that the trial court properly found that the city had carried its burden of proof in showing the necessity for and expediency of annexation of the territory granted and that such annexation was in the best interests of all parties concerned. As to the other county, the court affirmed that part of the order that found the necessity for and expediency of annexation. However, the court reversed those portions of the order that fixed the boundaries of the annexed territory and that failed to require the city to assume a just proportion of the school bond issue. A certain area that was closest to the heart of the city should not have been excluded from annexation, and all experts agreed that it should have been included.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Authority filed an application for the correction of an erroneous special assessment levied upon it by the city for the construction of sidewalks abutting the lands of the Authority. The Authority contended that, as a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Virginia, it was exempted from such assessments by virtue of Va. Code Ann &sect; 33-255-35 (1959). The city moved to dismiss the application. The trial court held that the application had been duly filed and that the property of the Authority was exempt from the assessments. The city appealed, and the court upheld the judgment. The court reviewed the applicable statute regarding special assessments and determined that the assessment involved constituted charges that became liens upon real estate and were embraced within the classification designated in Va. Tax Code &sect; 58-1145 as county or city levies or other local taxes on real estate. Under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 33-255.35 (1959), the Authority was clearly exempted from taxation. The levies imposed by the city, whether they were called &quot;taxes&quot; or &quot;assessments,&quot; were taxes improperly imposed as liens upon the real estate of a political subdivision.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.1-356 and 18.1-357, which required segregation, declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens wished to attend public events in a City-owned ballpark and auditorium and ballroom without being segregated as required by Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.1-356 and 18.1-357. The citizens testified they were told by the lessees that segregation would be enforced. The City attorney also testified that it would be his legal duty to prosecute any black citizens who refused to be segregated in such public venues. The citizens sought to have the statutes declared unconstitutional and injunctions to prevent their enforcement. The trial court granted the motions of all but one of defendants to strike the citizens' evidence and for summary judgment, but the court reversed. It was plain on the pleadings and evidence that the lessees, in enforcing segregation in the venues at issue, were acting in compliance with Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.1-356, and their actions consequently constituted State action and were contrary to the Equal Protection Clause as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. The court therefore held that under the decisions of the Supreme Court, Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.1-356 and 18.1-357 were invalid and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company owned a 394-acre tract of land from which it wished to sell parcels in excess of 10 acres each. The Board advised the company that it could not sell such parcels unless it complied with the subdivision ordinance. As amended, the ordinance stated that a separation of any tract of land into lots each of which containing an area of 10 acres or more was not to be considered a subdivision, except when the separation: (a) included a dedication of land to public use; or (b) involved the use of a road or street not already accepted into the state highway system, which road or street served three or more lots. The trial court, without taking evidence, declared the amendment unconstitutional because no limit was placed upon the size of the parcels constituting a subdivision under the amendment. On appeal, the court ruled that each locality had the right to define what constituted a &quot;subdivision.&quot; Whether a locality acted reasonably in defining that term in an ordinance adopted under the Virginia Land Subdivision Act, Va.

For such purchase it could issue its own bonds payable solely from its funds, including payments on or the proceeds of sale of local bonds owned by it and money or proceeds of obligations transferred to it from the Literary Fund under Chapter 195 of the Acts of 1962, which required such transfer semiannually of amounts in the Literary Fund of uncommitted funds in excess of ten million dollars.  The comptroller and state treasurer refused to make the transfers and disbursements under these Acts, contending they were unconstitutional in that Section 134 of the Constitution prohibited any transfer from the principal of the Literary Fund.  In the instant proceeding for mandamus under Code 1950, section 8-714, it was held, however, that the 1944 amendment to Section 134 empowers the General Assembly to provide for use of Literary Fund assets for school purposes so long as the principal is not reduced below ten million dollars.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The grant of power to the Authority to pledge local school bonds acquired by it to secure its own bonds does not constitute a lending of the credit of the issuing locality in violation of Section 185 of the Constitution.

The court awarded the writ and held that it found nothing unconstitutional in ch. 194 and 195. Va. Const. &sect; 134 was not violated by the setting aside of a part of the principal of the Literary Fund, and the use of the principal of the Literary Fund was for a public purpose. The use of the annual interest as collateral security for bonds issued and to meet administrative expenses was not contrary to Va. Const. &sect; 135. The provisions authorizing the Virginia Public School Authority to pledge the local school bonds to be acquired by it as collateral security for bonds issued did not constitute a lending of the credit of the county, city, or town in violation of Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1955, the town brought a suit against the property owners when they began to repair a fire-damaged building allegedly in violation of the town's zoning ordinances. The trial court issued a decree perpetually enjoining the property owners from repairing the building until they complied with the zoning laws. The court refused the property owners' appeal. Several years later, a neighbor brought suit when the property owners again commenced repairs. The town joined as a party and the trial court ordered removal of certain improvements within 10 days under penalty of contempt. On appeal, the court affirmed. In the 1955 case, the trial court had jurisdiction and the legal authority to make the decree. The refusal of the property owners to obey that decree made them liable for contempt. Even if it was erroneous, it was as binding on them as if it had been correct, until it was vacated, dissolved, or set aside. The question whether the property owners were guilty of contempt was not rendered moot by the alleged destruction by fire of the building in 1962. There was no evidence in the record of the 1962 fire or its effect; and this presented a matter for consideration by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The insurer claimed that service on John Doe violated due process and that the title of 1958 Va. Acts ch. 282 amending &sect; 38.1-381 was misleading. The court held that constructive service under &sect; 38.1-381 did not violate due process because the kind and manner of notice prescribed by the statute afforded the insurer a reasonable opportunity to be heard. If exonerated from liability, the insurer would be unjustly enriched because it had accepted the risk of uninsured motorist coverage and received a premium therefor, and, through John Doe, it filed pleadings and controlled the litigation. The acts of the General Assembly were presumed to be constitutionally enacted both as to title and text and the challenged title gave notice of the coverage required in all automobile insurance policies. Va. Const. &sect; 52 was not violated because inclusion of the procedure for enforcing a claim under the statute was germane to the general object stated in the act's title and was not misleading.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The non-profit corporation operated as a volunteer fire department until its service area was incorporated by an adjacent city. After the corporation's charter was revoked, the corporation decided to issue a prorated share of its remaining assets to each member, who would then donate his shares to the charity of his choice. The former president filed a complaint for judicial distribution of the corporate assets. The trial court overruled the demurrer filed by the officers and directors, appointed a receiver, and distributed the assets to three charitable organizations. On appeal, the court affirmed. The former president was permitted to file suit pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 13.1-275(e), which gave any person standing for good cause. The former president knew that the corporation was planning to illegally distribute assets raised from public funds and voluntary contributions to members who had acquired no rights or pecuniary interests in the funds. In the absence of a volunteer fire department in the corporation's area, the trial court properly directed the funds to be distributed to three organizations engaged in similar activities, pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 13.1-258(c).</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the attorney's conduct amounted to improper solicitation of professional employment by personal communication not warranted by personal relations, which violated both the letter and the spirit of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 54-74(6), and Canon 27 of the Virginia Canons of Professional Ethics. The court further found that the trial court did not err in finding that these provisions had been violated. The court also found no constitutional rights of the attorney were violated because the attorney had no right to improperly solicit professional employment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was an African-American, arrested for trespass under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18-225. A privately owned corporation operated a large department store. It operated lunch counters in the basement and on the first floor and a restaurant on the fourth floor. African Americans were served at one of the lunch counters in the basement. Only white patrons were served at the other lunch counters and in the restaurant. Defendant and 33 other African Americans went to the store and attempted to obtain service at the facilities reserved for the use of white patrons. Because of their race they were refused service at the facilities and the store manager asked them to leave the premises. The court affirmed the trial court's decision convicting defendant of trespass. It plainly appeared from the evidence that defendant violated the statute by willfully and purposely remaining on the premises after he had been forbidden to do so by the owner's duly authorized agent. The trespass statute was not a racial segregation law because it forbid any person to go or remain upon the lands of another after having been forbidden to do so. The Fourteenth Amendment erected no shield against private conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to the city's zoning ordinance, the union filed an application for a use permit to construct and maintain a union hiring hall on property owner's land. City Council refused to grant the permit. Complainants then filed an action seeking to have the zoning ordinance declared invalid and unconstitutional. The lower court upheld the ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's decree. From an analysis of the National Labor Relations Act (Act) and the cases decided interpreting the Act, it was clear that Congress did not occupy and close the field of labor relations affecting interstate commerce to the exclusion of the states' traditional authority to exercise their police power. Thus, Congress did not exclude the city from exercising its police powers by requiring a use permit for the union's hiring hall. Moreover, the ordinance did not contravene the provisions of the Act. The ordinance made it mandatory to issue the use permit if the standards prescribed were met. Thus, sufficient protection against an arbitrary and uncontrolled exercise of discretion was provided. It would have been impracticable for the city to have provided a more definite set of standards.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was standing in front of a department store where a large number of people were picketing. Defendant contended that the ordinance under which she was convicted was unconstitutional because it was an unlawful delegation of legislative power and because it was vague and ambiguous. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the city validly exercised the powers given it under its charter and did not unlawfully delegate its legislative power. The court held that a city could, in the execution of its police power, invest its officers with a reasonable discretion in the performance of duties, whenever it was necessary for the safety and welfare of the public. The court reasoned that the ordinance in question was of a regulatory nature and was designed to preserve the safety, peace, good order, and convenience of the inhabitants of the city, and to prevent conduct in the streets dangerous to the public. Further, the court held that the ordinance was clear, certain, and definite, so that the average man could, with due care, understand whether he would incur a penalty for his action or not.</SPAN></P>

The trial court permanently enjoined the town from enforcing its license tax. The town appealed, and the court reversed the judgment. The court held that the tax in question was a license or privilege tax and not a tax on the property itself. Thus, it was not violative of Va. Const. &sect; 168. The town residents paid the same license tax under the town's ordinance as those residents outside paid the county under its ordinance. The classification of towns within a county as separate taxing units for the requirement of motor vehicle licenses was reasonable and not such hostile discrimination against the counties as to have been arbitrary. Construing the statutes together, as required, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.1-66 did not prohibit the town from imposing a license tax as authorized by Va.

The court granted defendant's motion to exclude unnecessary witnesses from the courtroom, although a sheriff and his deputy, who testified to defendant's confession, were permitted to stay. Defendant objected at trial to the venire facias because there were no women in the jury. On appeal, the court held that the venire properly included the names drawn for jury service, as required by Va. Code &sect; 19-173. There was no merit in defendant's contention that Va. Code &sect; 8-182 was unconstitutional for the allowance of permissive exclusion to women jurors. The testimony of the sheriff and deputy was cumulative and did not go to a material fact because defendant admitted the murder of the victim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant non-profit membership corporations sought review of decrees by the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond (Virginia) which held that non-profit membership corporations' constitutional guarantees were not violated, that the non-profit membership corporations were engaged in the improper solicitation of legal business, and that non-profit membership corporations were violating 1956 Va. Acts ch. 33.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Non-profit membership corporations challenged the effects of 1956 Va. Acts ch. 33, 36 as they applied to them and their activities. The non-profit membership corporations alleged that the statutes were unconstitutional and void because their enforcement would deny them due process of law and equal protection in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court determined that under the statutes the non-profit membership corporations were violating canons of legal ethics by improperly soliciting legal business and employment and that the nonprofit membership corporations had no direct interest with the persons that they claim to represent. The court affirmed the lower court's determination that 1956 Va. Acts ch. 33 was not unconstitutional as it was valid under the state's police power and the solicitation of legal business by the nonprofit membership corporations were in violation of this statute. The court reversed the lower court's decree that held 1956 Va. Acts ch. 36 constitutional because the court concluded that it violated the right of free speech and denied equal protection and due process under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Lower court's decrees were affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for entry of a decree consistent with the opinion. The court found that one statute was a valid regulation of the practice of law enacted under the police powers of the state. However, the other statute in question was deemed unconstitutional because it violated the nonprofit membership corporations right to freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>

The attorney general brought the proceeding in mandamus. The court awarded mandamus to the attorney general. The court held that &sect;&sect; 15-666.69 through 666.76 did not violate Va. Const. &sect; 115a. The court determined that &sect; 115a was amended by the addition of a paragraph permitting the school board of any county to contract to borrow money from the Virginia Supplemental Retirement System. The fact that the governor did not proclaim the amendment when it was made did not prevent it from being a valid amendment because the governor gave the figures showing that a majority of the votes cast were in favor of the amendment. In addition, the governor's proclamation was not essential to the ratification of the amendment. The general assembly was not prohibited from providing that the debt be evidenced by negotiable bonds, because the express power to borrow money included the power to issue bonds.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the acquisition, development and operation of port and harbor facilities contemplated at Hampton Roads was a proper governmental function and that the statutes involved were not violative of &sect; 185.

The court affirmed the decree of the circuit court, holding that &sect; 26-45.1 applied to the trusts here involved, both of which were created before that section was enacted. Unless the trust instrument provided otherwise, it was presumed that the trustor intended that his trustee should have the power to make such investments of the corpus of the trust as the legislature in its wisdom might from time to time permit. There was nothing in the trust instruments in the present case to indicate, as could readily have been done if desired, that the trustor intended to restrict investments to those enumerated in the statutes in effect at the time of the execution of the instruments.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 54-28.

On the request of their mother, the students were permitted by local school authorities to attend school, on a temporary basis, subject to being officially assigned by the local pupil placement board. Despite repeated requests made by the school authorities, the mother refused to file an application form as required by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 22-232.1 et seq. Because of this refusal, permission for the two students to attend the public schools was withdrawn. Petitioners sought a writ of mandamus, contending that Va. Const. &sect; 133 vested the power over enrollment in public schools exclusively in local school boards. The court rejection this contention. If the legislature deemed it advisable to vest the power of enrollment or placement of pupils in an authority other than the local school boards, it could do so without depriving such local school boards of any express or implied constitutional power of supervision. In addition, there was nothing in the registration form that violated petitioners' constitutional or other legal rights. The enforcement of the statute would in no way affect adversely what school that the students were able to attend.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Code Ann. &sect; 40-64, which prohibited those persons whom were not a bona fide employee of a business that was being picketed to participate in such picketing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants organized a local union that struck two businesses. Defendants never were employees of either business, but participated on a daily basis in the picketing activities. The court affirmed defendants' convictions under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 40-64. The court held that &sect; 40-64 did not violate either U.S. Const. amend. I, or Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, or U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court reasoned that &sect; 40-64, which made it unlawful for non-employees of a business to engage in striking or picketing activities of such business, was a valid exercise of the state's police power to reasonably limit the number of persons engaged in picketing to ensure a peaceful and orderly picketing. Further, the court reasoned that &sect; 40-64 was also based upon the policy that employers and employees were to have been left free to resolve their differences without pressure of outside influences. Next, the court held that defendants did not have rights to participate in the picketing under the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 152, 157, and 163, because the acts only applied to relations between employers and employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment that found defendants guilty of unlawful picketing because the statute at issue was a reasonable regulation of strikes and pickets, and therefore did not violate the United States or Virginia constitutions. Further, neither defendant had a right under the National Labor Relations Act to picket because they were not employees of either employer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the corporation omitted its gross receipts generated in the state on its annual report, the commission calculated the proportion of state railroads, highways, and airlines to the entire lines used by the corporation across the country, applied that proportion to the corporation's nationwide gross receipts, and assessed franchise taxes based on that calculation. The commission denied the corporation's application for correction and refund. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Va. Const. &sect; 170 authorized the commission to impose franchise taxes on foreign transportation corporations that only did interstate business in the state, and that the franchise tax was not a privilege tax wrongfully applied to an interstate business; instead, it was a property tax imposed on intangible property. The court found that the method used by the commission to calculate gross receipts was authorized by Va. Code &sect; 58-549, and was fair and reasonable. The court held that the commission's classification of automotive equipment and trucks as &quot;rolling stock&quot; was logical, and that under the Va.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant sought a permit to erect a gasoline service station in the City. The City denied the permit, and the applicant brought an action contesting the denial and arguing that &sect; 16 was unconstitutional. The trial court held that &sect; 16 was unconstitutional and ordered the City to issue the applicant the subject permit. On appeal, the City conceded that if an ordinance attempted to regulate an ordinary business it had to provide a uniform rule of action. But the City contended that the business of operating a gasoline service station was not an ordinary business but one tending to be injurious or dangerous to the public and that therefore the City, in the discretionary exercise of its police power, might permit or deny it. The court found that the operation of a gasoline filling station was not an inherently dangerous business. The court concluded that as there was no rule or standard present in &sect; 16 under which the City Council was to be guided in the exercise of its administrative powers, the presumption that the City acted reasonably in the exercise of its police powers and that the statute was valid, was lost, and the statute might be properly found unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant declined the offer and was prosecuted for his continuing refusal. On appeal, the court held that defendant did not refuse to send his child to school but rather sought to have her attend, and the prosecution was an unconstitutional application of &sect; 22-251 that denied defendant equal protection of the law under U.S. Const. amend. 14. The constitutionality of &sect; 22-251 was reaffirmed, but its application to bring about inequality of treatment of races was unjustified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant urged that the trial court erred in not holding that the second paragraph of Va. Code &sect; 46-189 was so vague and indefinite as to be unenforceable under the Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and of the Virginia Constitution. The duty of furnishing information regarding a hit and run accident was imposed not only on an occupant of a vehicle involved in an accident, but also upon any witness or other person having knowledge of an accident. The witness could have been a mere bystander, in no way concerned in the accident, and yet the paragraph placed upon him the duty of giving as much of the required information &quot;as possible,&quot; and made him a violator of the law for not doing so. The court held that the statute failed to specify when and to whom the occupant or other witness had to furnish the required information. The first paragraph required the driver of a motor vehicle to stop &quot;immediately&quot; at the scene or as close thereto as possible without obstructing traffic and give the specified information. But the paragraph imposing the duty on an occupant or witness did not require that he stop at the scene, nor did it specify when he had to furnish the information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the company challenged the validity of the peddler's license taxes, arguing that that the effect of Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 58-340, 58-344 exempted dairymen who used one or more wagons to sell and deliver milk, butter, cream, and eggs from procuring a peddler's license and prohibited the imposition of a municipal peddler's license tax upon those who were exempted from procuring such license. The court found that the company's drivers sold and delivered from its wagons or trucks in the city commodities other than &quot;milk, butter, cream and eggs.&quot; Both the State and city peddler's license taxes that were imposed were for the privilege of selling other commodities than those mentioned in the statute. Next, the company contended that the license taxes were invalid because the taxes were unconstitutional, imposing a tax on the company's operations in interstate commerce and discriminating against the company's business in interstate commerce by denying equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, in that resident dairies were not assessed with such taxes. That contention was answered in a prior case adversely to the company.</SPAN></P>

The court held that while Va. Code Ann. &sect; 36-49(2) empowered the authority to acquire other real property for the purpose of removing, preventing, or reducing blight, blighting factors or the cause of blight, under this paragraph an authority could for the stated purpose incidentally include in the project property which was not itself necessarily blighted or deteriorated, but that did not alter the requirement that when such incidental part was included the area as a whole must be blighted or deteriorated.</SPAN></P>

While conceding that the board would use the money for the purposes stated in the ballot and court order approving the issuance of the bonds, the resident successfully sought to enjoin the board's use of the money for integrated schools as the voters had allegedly authorized a bond issue only for segregated schools. On appeal, the court reversed the decree in the resident's favor by finding that, as it was conceded by the resident that the proceeds from the bonds would be used for the purposes of school improvements as stated in the ballot, the court was not empowered to interfere with the administrative duty of the board to expend the proceeds from the bond issue.</SPAN></P>

The truck brought back the clean articles to the store for delivery by the vehicles to the county customers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney general filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to determine the item's validity after respondent State Comptroller had to consider vouchers to pay funds to children attending private institutions. The court denied the writ. The item was unconstitutional and void to the extent that it purported to authorize payments for tuition, institutional fees, and other designated expenses of eligible children who attended private schools. The payment of money to sectarian schools was unconstitutional. The item used public funds to support religious institutions. It afforded sectarian groups an invaluable aid. It helped to provide pupils for their religious classes. It compelled taxpayers to contribute money for the propagation of religious opinions, which they may have not believed. To have sustained the validity of the item would have meant that by like appropriations the General Assembly might have diverted public funds to the support of a system of private schools which Virginia's Constitution forbade. If that had been a desirable end, it should have been accomplished by amending the constitution. It should not have been done by judicial legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Commissioner of the Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles, challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for the County of Norfolk (Virginia), which perpetually restrained the Commissioner from enforcing an order entered under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46-416.2 revoking appellee driver's permit to operate a motor vehicle after overruling the Commissioner's demurrer to the driver's petition for review filed under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46-424.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commissioner's order followed the driver's convictions for reckless driving and for operating an automobile at an unlawful speed. The driver argued that the mandatory revocation requirement of &sect; 46-416.2 did not apply to him because it took effect after his conviction of those offenses and that if &sect; 46-416.2 had a retroactive effect, it was an unconstitutional ex post facto law. On appeal, the court disagreed. The style, title, and contents of the driver's petition established that it was an appeal under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46-424 (1950) for review of the revocation order rather than an original petition or bill for equitable relief. Section 46-424 unequivocally stated that no appeal could lie in any case in which the revocation of the license was mandatory except to determine the identity of the person concerned when the question of identity was in dispute. Because the issues presented by the driver in his petition did not involve the question of identity, the court held that under the mandatory language of &sect; 46-424 it was clear that the issues could not be considered. Thus, the court held that the Commissioner's demurrer should have been sustained, and the petition was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, dissolved the injunction against the Commissioner, sustained the Commissioner's demurrer, and dismissed the driver's petition.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Act was unconstitutional because (1) it required a dry cleaners' license tax for the mere transportation of clothes and other fabrics to and from a dry cleaning establishment with no reason to discriminate between such activity and the transportation of packages or similar items; (2) it delegated unlimited discretion to an administrative agency to promulgate rules regulating the granting, suspending, or revoking of licenses to conduct a business without fixing any standard or test to guide and control the exercise of such discretion, so that the agency was exercising legislative functions; and (3) it made an unreasonable and arbitrary classification of the areas in which it was to be effective by allowing private citizens in the regulated industry to vote on whether or not the Act and its tax was to be effective in their regions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that it was illegal for defendant to purchase alcoholic beverages or to possess any alcoholic beverages because he was an &quot;improper person&quot; to be allowed to purchase alcoholic beverages under &sect; 4-51(a). The trial court's judgment was based upon that portion of &sect; 4-51(a) which provided that a court was empowered to interdict any person who had shown himself to be an &quot;improper person&quot; to be allowed to purchase alcoholic beverages. Defendant argued that that portion of the statute upon which the judgment was based was illegal and void and contrary to the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and of the United States of America. The court agreed and held that the phrase &quot;improper person&quot; admitted of such arbitrary interpretation as to make the provision unconstitutionally vague and indefinite.

The trial court struck the seller's evidence upon the buyer' motion brought pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 59-61.1 through 59-61.12 of the Virginia Paint Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The seller manufactured the paint it sold to the buyer. The buyer successfully defended from the seller's suit to recover the balance of the purchase price after testimony established that the seller had not complied with Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 59-61.1 through 59-51.12 of the Virginia Paint Law (Law). The court affirmed the striking of the seller's evidence and the judgment in the buyer's favor. The court reached that conclusion after determining that the Law did not violate the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The Law made it unlawful for any person to sell paint within Virginia unless the requirements of the Law were met. Violations of the Law constituted a misdemeanor. The court reasoned that the Law only touched upon interstate commerce, but that its main focus was on matters of local concern, that being to protect purchasers of paint by ensuring that the contents of a can of paint were that as purported. Further, the court found that the Law did not discriminate against interstate commerce in favor of intrastate commerce because it applied to all sellers of paint. Therefore, the sale being illegal the court refused to enforce the contract.</SPAN></P>
