</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, executors and academy, challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Fresno County (California), which denied their motion for attorney's fees pursuant to either to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 5152, or Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1021.5. Appellants had obtained a summary judgment in their action for a refund of real property taxes paid to respondent county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During the probate administration of a will, respondent county assessed taxes on the real property received by appellant academy from the will. Appellant executors brought an action on behalf of appellant academy for a refund of these taxes because appellant academy was exempt from ad valorem property taxation. The trial court rendered summary judgment to appellants. Appellants then brought a motion for costs and attorney's fees pursuant to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 5152, and Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1021.5, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the court held that because the assessments were made prior to the enactment of Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 538, the assessor was under no mandate to bring a declaratory relief action in lieu of making the assessment. Thus, because the &sect; 538 procedures were not in effect, appellants were not entitled to attorney's fees under &sect; 5152. The court held that appellants were not entitled to attorney's fees under &sect; 1021.5, because the action did not benefit a large class of people, and appellants failed to show that the financial burden in pursuing the litigation was disproportionate to the value of private benefits gained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which denied attorney's fees to appellants, executors and academy, in their action against respondent county for refund of property taxes. Appellants could not recover attorney's fees for respondent's failure to seek declaratory relief prior to making assessment because respondent was under no duty to do so at time assessment was made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Fresno County (California), which denied its claim against respondents, state and Commission on State Mandates, and found that Cal.

Appellant had brought a claim to respondent commission seeking reimbursement for costs incurred in implementing the Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county brought a claim with respondent Commission on State Mandates, seeking reimbursement from respondent state for costs incurred in implementing the Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory Act, Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 25500 et seq., under Cal. Const. art. XIII B, &sect; 6. Respondent commission denied the claim, finding reimbursement prohibited by Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 17556(d), and finding that the program was not state-mandated. Appellant sought a writ of mandate and declaratory relief, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 25500 et seq., constituted a state-mandated program under art. XIII B, &sect; 6, because it imposed unique requirements on local governments. The court held that &sect; 17556(d), which provided that costs were not mandated by respondent state if the local agency could levy service charges, fees, or assessments to pay for the mandated program, was not unconstitutional under art. XIII B, &sect; 6. The legislature's interpretation of &quot;costs&quot; for which respondent state was required to reimburse a local agency as set forth in &sect; 17556(d), was reasonable, and the court had a duty to accept this meaning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which denied appellant county's claim for relief from respondent Commission on State Mandate's decision that appellant was not entitled to reimbursement from respondent state for costs incurred in implementing state hazardous materials release response program. Legislature's interpretation that &quot;costs&quot; only included costs that could not otherwise be recouped by agency was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Butte County (California), which granted a preliminary injunction in favor of respondent county and held that respondent would probably prevail in its dispute with appellant regarding the state's power to require that local funds be directed to a state-mandated program, pursuant to Cal. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 11and Cal. Const. art. XIII A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent county challenged appellant state's power to require that local funds be directed to state-mandated programs under Cal. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 11and Cal. Const. art. XIII A. The trial court issued a preliminary injunction ordering appellant to fund the entire program. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the injunction was not supported by the constitution, home rule, or impossibility. The court held that respondent could not challenge appellant's statutory scheme for fundings on due process grounds because political subdivisions of a state could not challenge the validity of a state statute under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and because respondent had no property interest in its revenues. The court held that Cal. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 11 allowed the legislature to reimburse counties, but did not require it. The court held that state legislation on matters of statewide concern did not implicate home rule rights and local government remained subject to state law. The court held that there was not sufficient evidence of respondent's impossibility theory because it could raise revenues and that the level of service decisions belonged with the electorate, not the officials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the injunction, remanded to the trial court, and held that the trial court had abused its discretion when it issued the injunction because there was not sufficient evidence that respondent county would prevail in its claim against appellant state on constitutional grounds or on the theories of home rule or impossibility of performance. The court ordered respondent to pay appellant's costs of appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Superior Court of Orange County (California) for transportation and possession for sale of narcotics, following denial of his motions to suppress evidence in both municipal and superior court.

On appeal, he contended that Cal.

The court affirmed. If the motion to suppress was made at the preliminary hearing and denied, under &sect; 1538.5(i), the motion could be renewed in the superior court but the evidence at that hearing was limited to the transcript of the preliminary hearing and to evidence which could not reasonably have been presented at the preliminary hearing, except that the people could recall witnesses who testified at the preliminary hearing. The court held that the prosecution's right to recall witnesses came into play only when the defendant was allowed to present evidence at the special hearing. Defendant was not improperly denied the right to present new witnesses because if they had been unavailable for the preliminary hearing, defendant could have requested a continuance to further investigate his case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent city determined that continuing development within its boundaries created a need for additional public facilities and capital improvements and enacted an ordinance requiring developers to pay a &quot;growth requirements capital fee&quot; when applying for a building permit. The fee was per square foot of new development. The collected fees were placed in a capital outlay fund to be used to pay for costs of capital improvements. In upholding the validity of the ordinance, the trial court found that the fee bore a reasonable relationship to the need for public improvements created by new development, that the formula for determining the fee was reasonable, that the fee was not a tax, and that the fee did not violate the California Constitution. The court concluded that it was reasonable to assume that if a city doubles in size, it will need to double the amount of capital invested in public facilities and that it was not unreasonable to expect a developer to help finance the additional capital.</SPAN></P>

Because nonunion employees benefitted from representation by the union, the court held that the fair share fee was proper, and it did not violate appellants' rights under U.S. Const. amend. I or U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court found that the fair share fee was a reduced fee, not full union member dues, so that appellants could not get a refund under Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 3515.8. The court affirmed the order of the trial court that granted summary judgment to respondents. The court held that appellants received benefits for the payment of the fair share fee, which included lobbying efforts by the union to improve their work terms and conditions.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the statute as constitutional. The court held that the statute did not discriminate against plaintiffs or deny them a liberty or property right.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff real party in interest was a real estate broker. In applying for membership in defendant association, her employer purchased a policy issued by defendant insurer. Plaintiff was served as a defendant in several lawsuits.

Plaintiff filed suit when a dispute arose on when the defense costs and attorney's fees would be paid, and sought an order requiring defendants to file a bond or, in the alternative, to strike their answer and enter default. Respondent trial court ordered defendants to post a bond, and defendants petitioned for a peremptory writ of mandate to review the order. The court issued the writ as to defendant association, and otherwise denied the petition. The court held that Cal. Ins.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent contractor filed a suit against appellant manufacturer after a dispute arose as to the amount that appellant owed for past services.

The court affirmed the finance charge on appeal, finding that the rate charged reflected a valid liquidated damages provision. The court determined that the provision as to the finance charge was not usurious because the charge was a contingency that was solely within appellant's control. The court also determined that there was no forbearance because respondent merely stated that it would impose a penalty if appellant's payment was late. The court further concluded that the usury laws were not primarily intended to apply to deals between two companies with relatively equal bargaining power.

Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(14). The court affirmed that order on appeal. The court found that the state's appeal was valid because the trial seemed to have proceeded to its conclusion on parts of the information that the matter at issue did not affect. The court also held that it lacked the authority to depart from California Supreme Court precedent that held that statutory references to a murder as especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity were unconstitutionally vague. The court further reasoned that due process required the same specificity and clarity in defining the special circumstance that it required in defining the crime. The court also concluded that uncontradicted evidence showed that defendant's victim died before dismemberment or amputation occurred, and that torture required having a living victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants landowners brought an action against respondents, Department of Health Services and others, contending that by retaining a water moratorium and not providing appellants with new water service connections, respondents had inversely condemned appellants' land and failed to pay the required compensation. The trial court dismissed appellants' complaint upon respondents' demurrer claiming the failure to state a cognizable cause of action. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of dismissal, holding that where appellants purchased properties lacking any water connection, respondents' continuation of the water moratorium did nothing to take, damage or otherwise diminish the value of what they had, essentially unimproved real property with no access to potable water. The court found that respondents did nothing to extinguish a fundamental attribute of ownership because appellants' land was in the same state as when they acquired it as real property lacking any service connection to the district water system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of dismissal because appellant landowners bought the property knowing it was not connected to the district water system and knowing it had no potable water, and therefore appellants were not in any different position, due to respondent Department of Health Services' moratorium, than they were before. There was no basis in fact or law for appellants' inverse condemnation claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Surplus real property owned by respondent community college district was leased to a religious group for 75 years. Appellant homeowners' organization brought an action to invalidate the lease, and the trial court granted respondent summary judgment. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed. The court held that restrictions imposed under Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 82530 upon the short-term use of school grounds by religious organizations had not extended to the sale or long-term lease of surplus real property under Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 81360. Furthermore, the court held the lease had not been an establishment of religion under U.S. Const. amend. I and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 4. First, the court found the lease, which was secular in purpose, had not advanced religion. In finding no advancement, the court held that any benefits the religious group had received were incidental, that respondent had not placed its imprimatur on the religious activity, and that the lease had been open to all groups. Second, the court found respondent's administerial rights as a landlord had not created an impermissible entanglement with the religious affairs of the religious group.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent employer appealed a judgment in the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which awarded damages to plaintiff employee in an action for wrongful termination, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, as a result of her failure to submit to drug urinalysis testing. Plaintiff appealed the denial of a posttrial motion for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee filed a lawsuit against respondent employer for wrongful termination as a result of plaintiff's refusal to submit a urine sample for drug testing. In a jury trial, plaintiff was awarded damages for loss off compensation and benefits, emotional distress, and punitive damages. Respondent appealed on the merits, and plaintiff appealed the denial of attorney fees. The court affirmed the judgment in both appeals. It found that there was sufficient evidence to show that an implied contract existed between plaintiff and respondent, rather than &quot;at will&quot; employment, as plaintiff had worked for respondent for over six years, and had received grade and salary increases. Respondent was required to show good cause for the termination. The court found that urinalysis intruded on plaintiff's reasonable expectation of privacy protected under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. Respondent, even as a private employer, was bound by those privacy protections. The court found no compelling interests to justify invasion of plaintiff's privacy because respondent failed to show a clear direct nexus existed between plaintiff's duties as a computer programmer and any feared safety risk.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment, which denied attorney fees to plaintiff, because she failed to show that her legal victory transcended her personal interests.</SPAN></P>

Gov't Code &sect; 17556(d), in light of Cal. Const. art. XIII B, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff county implemented a system to coordinate activity relating to residential development, as mandated by defendant state through a recently amended statute. Plaintiff then sought state reimbursement of resulting expenses. It was concluded that plaintiff had the legal authority to charge sufficient fees for the higher level of service directly attributable to the new measure, precluding any obligation for reimbursement of implementation costs. Plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of mandate and a complaint for declaratory relief seeking the decision's reversal based on an unconstitutional conflict between the provisions of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 17556(d) and the more restrictive terms of Cal. Const. art. XIII B, &sect; 6, both of which regulated financing of mandated programs. The trial court denied the writ petition and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that neither &sect; 6 nor any other section of art. XIII B, specifically prohibited further legislative definitions of those circumstances obviating reimbursement for state mandated programs. Statutory and constitutional analysis required the court to harmonize the provisions wherever possible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the denial of plaintiff county's petition for a writ of mandate and dismissal of plaintiff's complaint against defendant state, because the constitutional provision did not preclude the legislature from enlarging upon exceptions to state reimbursement to local governments for state mandated programs. The statutory and constitutional provisions were harmonized and construed to give effect to all parts.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute was not a usurpation of the senate's power to adopt rules for its proceedings, nor did it place any limitation on the legislature's authority to appropriate funds for its internal operation. The court held that the statute advanced the legitimate state interest in avoiding arbitrary preference of one candidate over another by reason of incumbency and of conserving limited state revenues. The court held that, properly interpreted, the statute did not limit other forms of mass mailings by the government.

Plaintiffs sued to recover damages for violations of the Cal. Food &amp; Agric. Code. They also sought a declaration that Cal. Food &amp; Agric. Code &sect; 12673 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant county employee, acting under the authority of defendant State of California, gratuitously instructed plaintiff farmers to spray their raspberry crop with a pesticide. Plaintiffs followed the advice. Defendant County of Los Angeles's officials issued cease-and-desist directives prohibiting them from harvesting and selling their crop because the fruit carried an excessive pesticide residue. Plaintiffs sued defendants for damages for violations of the Cal. Food &amp; Agric. Code and sought a declaration that Cal. Food &amp; Agric. Code &sect; 12673 was unconstitutional. Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings, which was granted. The trial court concluded that defendants were entitled to governmental immunity and entered a judgment against plaintiffs. Plaintiffs appealed. The court affirmed the judgment and held that defendant county employee's misinformation was a misrepresentation for purposes of immunity. Any damages caused by plaintiffs' reliance on the misrepresentation were barred under the immunity provisions of Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 818.8, 822.2.

It was not an abuse of discretion to refuse to grant plaintiff farmers' request for declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Numerous charges against defendants were dismissed in exchange for their guilty pleas to the offense of transportation of methamphetamine in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11379. On appeal, defendants contended that the trial court erred in denying suppression of evidence. The court disagreed. Although defendants had standing to challenge their initial detention, the detention was lawful because the officers' subjective suspicion that defendants' vehicle was improperly displaying a commercial license plate was objectively reasonable under the U.S. Const. amend. IV. Defendants lacked standing to object to the warrantless search of the vehicle because the vehicle was stolen. Therefore, defendants had no legitimate expectation of privacy. It was unnecessary to reach the issue of the legitimacy of the patdown search because the evidence would have inevitably been discovered during a search incident to a lawful arrest for vehicle theft or possession of drugs. The court properly considered this theory of inevitability for the first time on appeal because defendants were not prejudiced by the failure to raise this theory below. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendants' convictions of transportation of methamphetamine. The initial detention was lawful because it was based on an objectively reasonable suspicion, defendants lacked standing to challenge the search of their vehicle because it was stolen, and the legitimacy of the patdown search was not reviewed because the evidence inevitably would have been discovered during a search incident to a lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant doctor was convicted of Medi-Cal fraud, in violation of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 14107, for knowingly submitting false information to obtain greater compensation than that to which he was entitled. On appeal, defendant alleged among other claims, that the Medi-Cal regulations were void for vagueness and that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the meaning of &quot;knowingly.&quot; The court disagreed. Defendant's vagueness argument assumed that he was convicted of violating a Medi-Cal regulation. He was not. Defendant was convicted of criminal fraud. Therefore, the trial court properly adjudicated the vagueness of Cal. Code Regs. tit. 22, &sect; 51503 as an issue of fact, going to the determination of defendant's specific intent to defraud. There was abundant evidence in support of the finding that defendant intended to defraud Medi-Cal. The jury instructions were proper. It would have been error for the trial court to instruct the jury that the definition of &quot;knowingly&quot; excluded knowledge of the unlawfulness of the act. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The people appealed the decision of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which ordered that evidence in a narcotics case be suppressed since the warrant was ruled to be facially deficient.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The people appealed the decision ordering that evidence in a narcotics case be suppressed after the warrant was ruled to be facially deficient. The affidavit in support of the warrant failed to state that the search, which would take place in another county, related to a crime in the issuing county. Despite that omission, the court disagreed with the trial court and held that the good faith exception applied. Since it was undisputed that the drug transactions had occurred in the issuing county, there could be no conceivable bad faith motive for omitting that information from the affidavit. That would amount to unwarranted speculation. The question was whether reliance on the validity of the warrant was objectively reasonable. The search warrant was regular on its face and the affidavit in support of the search warrant was not so constitutionally deficient as to render belief in probable cause entirely unreasonable. Exclusion of the evidence would not further the purposes of the exclusionary rule, so that rule was inapplicable. The trial court erred in granting the motion to suppress the evidence. The order of dismissal was reversed and the matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed appellant's conviction and held that the trial court did not err in admitting appellant's spontaneous utterance of &quot;oh oh&quot; when an officer stated, &quot;I think I have something here,&quot; because there was no interrogation or its equivalent. Appellant's statement was the type of spontaneous utterance that was admissible even in the absence of Miranda warnings. The mere fact that appellant might have perceived the officer's remark as directed to her did not compel the conclusion that the officer's conduct was the functional equivalent of an interrogation.

Appellant sought review and contended that the default judgment must be vacated because he was not personally served with the statement of damages and because respondent's proof at the default hearing amounted to a de facto amendment of the complaint, which should have revived appellant's ability to respond. Appellant also argued that the judgment erroneously relied upon two sections of the San Francisco Rent Ordinance which were unconstitutional, the judgment exceeded the relief demanded, and the trial court abused its discretion in denying relief from default under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 473. The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that service was made upon appellant's attorney and that respondent did not substantively change his complaint. In addition, appellant's failure to respond to the complaint admitted the truth of the allegations. Therefore, the eviction was unlawful and respondent was entitled to damages.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that possession of such sometimes-useful objects was outlawed only when the attendant circumstances, including the time, place, destination of the possessor, the alteration of the object from standard form, and other relevant facts indicated that the possessor would use the object for a dangerous, not harmless, purpose. The court held that the statute outlawed other instruments besides those specifically enumerated, and that a collapsible baton such as the one possessed by appellant was among those weapons the statute proscribed.</SPAN></P>

The issue was whether, under a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; drug provision in the lease, appellants could be evicted based on the possession of drugs by their son, who had signed the lease as a &quot;household member.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant tenants occupied a federally sponsored apartment operated by respondent City of South San Francisco Housing Authority.

Appellants' son was caught in the apartment with drugs in his possession. The municipal court evicted appellants. On appeal, the court held that the lease provision was clear and unambiguous. The stipulated facts established that appellants had breached the lease. Under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1437d(1) and (5), which was implemented by 24 C.F.R. 966(f)(12) (1995), any drug-related activity on the premises by any member of appellants' household was cause for termination of their lease.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant campers were charged with violation of West Hollywood, Cal., Code &sect; 4801 which prohibited camping in the city's parks. The ordinance defined camping as using the park for living purposes. Following a hearing to determine if there was probable cause to believe defendants committed the crime, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 99(a), the trial court granted defendants' motions to dismiss. Plaintiff state sought review. The court reversed. The court held that probable cause existed to believe that defendants violated the ordinance, noting that defendants were sleeping on mattresses in the park using their personal possessions. The court held that the definition of camping was not unconstitutionally vague, noting that the examples provided in the definition provided fair notice as to the prohibited conduct and provided the police adequate guidelines to prevent arbitrary enforcement. The court held that while certain phrases in the definition were vague, the ordinance was sufficiently specific to prevent the police from criminalizing acceptable use of the park. The court held that the statute did not only affect homeless people nor did it impede any right to travel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of criminal contempt for willfully failing to pay child support in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 166(4). Defendant contended that the trial court erred in applying Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1209.5 because it addressed child support and the order defendant was accused of violating was for family support. Defendant also contended that the use of &sect; 1209.5 in a criminal contempt proceeding was unconstitutional because it created an improper assumption regarding ability to pay support. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that a family support order combined child support and spousal support and that the uncontroverted evidence showed defendant had three children. Further, the court found that pursuant to &sect; 1209.5, ability to pay was not an element for a finding of contempt. The court held that &sect; 1209.5 required only proof of an order, knowledge of the order, and noncompliance in order to establish a prima facie case. The court concluded that the trial court acted properly when it required defendant to raise his inability to pay as an affirmative defense, rather than requiring the state to prove ability to pay as an element of the offense.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that to prove a violation of the Curfew Law, respondent people were required to prove, as part of the elements of the offense, that each appellant committed an act of a nature to imperil lives or property or to hinder or delay law enforcement. The court held that there was no such evidence and that even if the trial court was entitled to take judicial notice of every factor affecting the condition of the city, the inference that appellants violated L.A.

The court also held that the statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.

The court held that when it applied the applicable standard, which was to determine whether the statute reasonably related to a legitimate governmental purpose, the legislative determination that the mandatory helmet law would protect motorcyclists was not unreasonable and therefore, there was no due process violation.

Appellant was charged with soliciting on county property in violation of Los Angeles, Cal., County Code &sect; 13.16.010. The trial court found appellant guilty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent Department for Health Services of the State of California issued a citation to appellant nursing home based on the treatment of an elderly patient who had been injured in a fall and experienced several incidences of leaving her bed. Respondent contended that the care warranted a class A citation because appellant was in violation of Cal. Code Regs. tit. 22, &sect;&sect; 72319(k)(1), 72311(a)(1)(C). Appellant contended that no change in the care plan was indicated. The court determined that the care plan needed to be updated at least quarterly, if not more often, depending on the needs of the patient, pursuant to statute. The court determined that the care plan had not been updated, and that there was sufficient evidence to support the alleged violation. The court determined that the statutes did not deprive appellant of due process and equal protection. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the prior judgment which supported a citation to a nursing home because there was substantial evidence in the record to support the finding of violations as alleged in the citation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent business owner filed an action against appellant customer based on a void transaction pursuant to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 6870, 6852, which pertained to collection agencies in the state. The trial court denied appellant's motion for nonsuit, denied its motion to vacate the judgment, and entered judgment in favor of respondent with prejudgment interest, costs, and attorney fees. The court reversed the judgment denying appellant's motion for nonsuit. Because respondent had no enforceable claim, the trial court erred in denying appellant's motion for nonsuit and entering judgment for respondent. The court stated that respondent's acts indicated that he was not simply acting as an individual in a one-time transaction. It was error for the trial court not to consider the application of &sect; 6870, given respondent's failure to become licensed prior to such conduct. The court found that the bidding for and purchasing of 578 delinquent credit card accounts constituted a solicitation of claims for collection. Not only was the contract of assignment or sale illegal pursuant to &sect;&sect; 6870, 6852, but respondent's conduct was subject to criminal prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his conviction for driving a motor vehicle with after-market tinted windows, in violation of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 26101. The trial court relied on case law holding that window-tinting proscription under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 26708(a) was unconstitutional as an undue burden on interstate commerce, as applied to an Arizona resident driving a motor vehicle with tinted windows that did not violate Arizona state law. After that case, the California highway patrol in San Bernardino County issued window-tinting violations under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 26101, rather than the unconstitutional&nbsp;Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 26708(a). Defendant contended that an exception existed for him to have the tinted windows due to a medical condition in his eye. However, the court stated that defendant had not shown by an adequate record the existence of all of the elements necessary to establish the medical-condition exemption to Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 26708(b)(10). Therefore, the court affirmed the decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After three special masters conducted an evidentiary hearing and prepared a written report, the Commission on Judicial Performance (California) considered the appropriate discipline pursuant to its authority under Cal. Const., art. VI, &sect; 18, subd. (d), to censure a former judge of the Ventura County Superior Court, California, for misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The special masters found that the judge had violated Cal. Code Jud. Ethics, canons 1, 2A, 2B(2), by repeatedly driving under the influence of alcohol and engaging in abusive and threatening behavior while he was intoxicated. The judge's appearance at the courthouse while under the influence of alcohol and his persistent failure to perform his duties violated Cal. Code Jud. Ethics, canon 3C(1). The masters also made a finding of habitual intemperance and determined that the phrase, as used in Cal. Const., art. VI, &sect; 18, subd. (d), provided adequate notice of the prohibited conduct. The masters observed that there was substantial mitigating evidence of the judge's rehabilitation efforts and of his professional competence while sober. The Commission agreed with the masters' findings of violations amounting to, at a minimum, prejudicial misconduct. The judge did not dispute that his conduct warranted a public censure, and the Commission noted the importance of reassuring the bench and the public that his misconduct would not be overlooked. The Commission concluded that it could not find the judge fit to sit on assignment without evidence of an extended period of sobriety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission ordered that the judge be publicly censured and that he be barred from receiving any assignment, appointment, or reference of work from any California state court. The bar was without prejudice to the judge filing, no sooner than a year after the entry of the Commission's order, a motion to lift the bar to assignment, appointments, and reference of work.</SPAN></P>
