</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant South Carolina Tax Commission (commission) appealed from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas for Richland County (South Carolina), which reversed a commission decision that respondent beer company was liable for a tax penalty for selling beer on a Sunday, in violation of &sect; 4-204, Code of Laws 1962 (South Carolina).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On a Sunday, when a schedule change meant that 10,000 troops on Shaw Air Force Base needed beer immediately, a base representative reached a branch manager of the beer company, at home after church, and advised him of the emergency. In response, the beer company immediately delivered 500 cases of beer to the base. The commission found the beer company guilty of selling beer on Sunday, but the common pleas court reversed, ruling that the statute invoked had no application to a sale of beer on Shaw Air Force Base, and that the sale in question took place there. On appeal, the commission challenged the ruling that the sale took place on the base. The court affirmed. The court ruled that the offer to purchase was conditioned on delivery to the base that day, and so acceptance of the offer took place on the base. The court noted that whether or not title to personal property contracted to be sold passed before or without delivery of the subject matter depended largely on the intention of the parties and the facts of the particular transaction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a taxpayer, individually and representing all others similarly situated, challenged the right of defendants, a mayor and a city council, to proceed with the issuance of general obligation bonds of the city to defray the cost of various municipal improvements. The taxpayer appealed a South Carolina lower court's order upholding the right of defendants to issue the bonds in question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that 54 Stat. 83, which purportedly ratified an amendment to S. C. Const. art. II, &sect; 13, was invalid because it was not properly ratified, and no subsequent legislative action was taken to implement it. The taxpayer also alleged that poorer electors were discriminated against in violation of due process and equal protection because voting in municipal bond elections was restricted to those electors who had paid all local, county, and state taxes for the prior year. Affirming, the court held that the provisions of art. II, &sect; 13, requiring that every act or resolution having the force of law shall relate to but one subject that shall be expressed in the title, did not apply to legislative action in proposing and ratifying constitutional amendments. Further, the constitutional amendment in question was self-executing, when read in conjunction with &sect; 47-835 of the Municipal Bond Act. Consequently, no further legislative action was required to relieve the city of the need for a freeholder' petition as a condition precedent to the holding of the bond election. Finally, it was not unconstitutional to require the payment of taxes as a condition of voting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with violating &sect; 16-414, which prohibited importing, printing, publishing, selling or other wise distributing certain obscene materials. The State argued that the trial court had erred in quashing the indictment. However, on review, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, adopting its judgment as its opinion. In doing so the court approved of the trial court's finding that &sect; 16-414 had been effectively repealed by &sect; 2 of the Act No. 265 of the South Carolina Acts and Joint Resolutions (1965). The court noted that &sect; 2 of the new act covered all areas set forth in &sect; 16-414 and that the new act changed the penalties imposed. The court then relied on the general proposition that a change of the elements of the offense or of the elements of the penalty, such as the change at issue, constituted a repeal of the prior statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured sustained damages when another automobile ran him off the road. There was no contact between the vehicles. The insurance carrier alleged that S.C. Code &sect; 47-750.34 (1964) (Supp.), which was enacted after the issuance of the policy, applied to the insured's cause of action and prohibited the establishment of liability because there was no contact between the vehicles. The trial court sustained the carrier's demurrer. The court reversed and held as follows: (1) the amendment in question did not have retroactive effect to bar the insured's pre-existent right to establish liability under his policy of insurance against the unknown motorist because there was nothing in its provisions to indicate a legislative intent that it operate retroactively so as to apply to policies issued prior to its adoption; (2) even if the statute had been remedial, it did not operate to destroy vested rights or the obligation of contracts which had accrued prior to its adoption; and (3) the remedy provided by the previous statute, which became a part of the insured's contract of insurance, did not require contact between the vehicles.</SPAN></P>

After the court directed that the inmate's sentence be carried out, he filed another application for a writ of habeas corpus and then he filed the instant motion for a stay of execution. The court denied the motion after it examined the grounds raised in the inmate's habeas corpus petition. It held that (1) &sect; 16-71, 1962 Code of Laws, the statute under which the inmate was convicted, clearly defined the offense of rape and it was not unconstitutionally vague or uncertain despite the inmate's contention to the contrary; (2) the inmate's contention that his detention violated due process had already been decided adversely to him on appeal and that determination was binding in the instant proceeding; (3) the death sentence given to the inmate did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because, even though the victim did not die, her life was endangered and threatened by the inmate's actions; and (4) there was no merit to any of the grounds asserted by the inmate and thus, he was not entitled to a stay of execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees sued the unions in separate suits for wrongful interference with employment relationship during a strike. The unions demurred, claiming that, because they were prevented from bringing suit as unincorporated associations under South Carolina law, it violated the federal Constitution's 14th Amendment to sue them. The trial court overruled the demurrers, and the court affirmed the trial court's actions. The court held that just because &sect; 10-215, South Carolina Code of Laws, 1962 said that unincorporated associations could be sued in their own name but did not say that they could also bring suit, it did not mean that they lacked the authority to bring suit. The court found the right to bring suit arose by implication upon noting that such associations could be sued, could have agents to receive service of process, could have judgments entered and levied against them, and could register and defend trademarks. Further, their right to sue arose from the fact that if they could only be sued and could not sue, that would deny them equal protection. The court refused to pass on the issue of a demurrer to a cause of action, since the circuit judge had not passed on it.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the indictment, which was phrased in substantially the language of &sect; 64-2, was adequate to charge the offense with sufficient certainty and particularity to apprise defendant of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. The statute did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I or S.C. Const. art.

The corporation argued that the Eminent Domain Law was special legislation, in contravention of article III, &sect; 34(9) of the 1895 Constitution of South Carolina. The lower court found that the Eminent Domain Law was void and unconstitutional. The court reversed, holding that the university's right and power of condemnation was delegated to it by &sect; 22-104(8) of the Code rather than by the Eminent Domain Law. The Eminent Domain Law described the procedure for acquisition of property by condemnation for the purposes therein stated. Section 22-107 of the Code authorized the trustees of the university, in their discretion, to make use of the provisions of the Eminent Domain Law to acquire lands for which funds were provided by the general assembly. Section 22-107 of the Code provided, by reference, a method of procedure for the exercise of the power of eminent domain conferred upon trustees by &sect; 22-104(8) of the Code.

Several actions were brought against it, claiming that sections of the Act violated the South Carolina Constitution and that the Commission's order amounted to taking of property without due process of law. The Commission filed suit against the grocer to determine the constitutionality of the sections and to have its order declared valid and constitutional. The lower court ruled in its favor. The court reversed, holding that so much of the Act that attempted to fix the price at which the grocer could sell milk at retail was violative of due process and the equal protection clauses of the Constitution. The business of selling milk at retail was not affected with a public interest, and the regulation of milk prices at the retail level exceeded the police power of the State. The purpose of the price-fixing was to protect the economy of the milk industry rather than the public health and welfare. That was not a proper basis for the exercise of the State's police power.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the carrier had failed to sustain the burden of proving that the application of the mileage formula to it produced an arbitrary, discriminatory, unreasonable or unconstitutional result.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted of rape. He later petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, which was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that African-Americans had not been systematically excluded by reason of their race from the grand and petit juries of Dorchester County in 1962, the year that the prisoner was convicted. All registered male electors were potential jurors. There was testimony that in 1962, 2,700 to 2,800 white males and 250 to 300 African-American males were registered. A minimum of two-thirds of the eligible male electors were selected for the jury list each year, and well over two-thirds of the eligible African-American voters were included. Thus, the evidence did not show a systematic limitation or exclusion of African-Americans from jury duty. The prisoner's second arraignment in the presence of his counsel cured any error that might have occurred when he was arraigned without counsel two days before. Although no attorney representing the prisoner was present at a preliminary hearing where the warrant was read and the seriousness of the charge explained, the preliminary hearing was not a critical stage of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 10, &sect;&sect; 5, 6 on a county's authority to issue bonds for educational purposes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district proposed an improvement program costing $ 800,000, but the eight-percent constitutional debt limitation restricted its authority to issue bonds to $ 300,000. Act No. 570 of the Acts of 1963 (South Carolina) authorized the county to sell bonds in the amount of $ 500,00 and turn the proceeds over to the school district. Because the duty of operating schools was vested in the district rather than the county, appellant argued that the legislation violated S.C. Const. Art. 10, &sect; 5, which provided that a county could only assess and collect taxes for corporate purposes, and S.C. Const. art. 10, &sect; 6, which restricted the purposes for which counties could issue bonds. In upholding the constitutionality of Act No. 570, the court ruled that the General Assembly could authorize a county to raise funds so long as they were spent on a proper purpose. Because both the school district and county could raise funds for educational purposes, the choice of governmental unit was a matter of legislative policy. As the county and school district were distinct corporate entities, the act did not transgress the school district's constitutional debt limit.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the rezoning of the property was not spot zoning because the property immediately to the west had been rezoned so that a shopping center could be built thereon. The rezoning merely expanded an existing commercial area. The master and the trial court concurred that the general welfare of the community would be advanced by reclassifying the property from residential to commercial. The court found no merit in the contention of the university that the rezoning ordinance amounted to a taking of its property for a private or public use without compensation therefor, and that it had been deprived of due process and the equal protection of the laws in violation of the state and federal constitutions. The court determined that the university had not met the burden of establishing that it had been prejudiced by the master's failure to expressly rule on objections to the evidence.

The Common Pleas Court, Union County, Bruce Littlejohn, J., entered judgment adverse to taxpayer-elector, and taxpayer-elector appealed. The Supreme Court, Moss, J., held that constitutional amendment increasing debt limitation and requiring voter approval for incurrence of bonded debt as to Union school district No. 11, Union County, did not perpetuate district No. 11 as an entity and was not applicable to school district of Union County, which was a consolidation of several districts including district No. 11, and, therefore, school district of Union County could issue bonds under statute authorizing issuance by district without an election.</SPAN></P>

The act allowed the school board of district number 11 to issue general obligation bonds without submitting the question to the qualified electors of the school district number 11. The taxpayer contended that the Act violated the provisions of an amendment to S.C. Const. art. X, &sect; 5(5). The county had been divided into a number of school districts. Under the Act, all of the districts were consolidated into one district. The taxpayer argued that under the amendment the electors were entitled to vote upon any bond issuance, and that the Act was subject to such amendment. The trial court granted judgment in favor of the school officials and the taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed and held that the constitution was not applicable to the school district and that it could, as authorized by the 1963 Act, issue bonds of said school district under the conditions and limitations imposed by that Act. Under the constitution the school districts had no permanent existence and the general assembly had plenary power to consolidate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife sought a divorce on the ground of desertion approximately one month after the desertion. The wife conceded that she was not entitled to a divorce under &sect; 20-101(2) because the period of desertion had not continued for one year prior to the commencement of the action. The wife asserted that the legislature was without power to place a time limitation on the period of desertion in view of S.C. Const. art. 17, &sect; 3. The trial court sustained the constitutionality of the statute and denied the divorce. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court that &sect; 20-101(2) of the 1962 code of Laws (South Carolina), in no way contravened, S.C. Const. art. 17, &sect; 3, and was a valid exercise of legislative power. Because the legislature had plenary power in legislative matters it might enact any law relating to the subject of divorce not prohibited by the constitution.

The common pleas court struck a portion of the city's defensive pleadings. The court affirmed. The court held that the common pleas court did not err in striking the city's allegation that the tax was imposed based on an agreement between the parties. The city tax ordinance was not ambiguous, so there was no ground for admitting evidence that the companies had agreed to pay more taxes in prior years. Also, &sect; 47-407 was not unconstitutional. Its classification differences between towns based on population was reasonably related to its object.

The Supreme Court, Bussey, J., held that statute authorizing construction of parking facilities encroaching upon or projecting over public sidewalks, precluding encroachment upon or projection over state highway system except with respect to facilities constructed or in process of construction at time of passage of act, was, with respect to encroachment over state highways, unconstitutional as special legislation to allow construction of specific facility in one city, and as history of legislation led to conclusion that no part of act would have been passed except for purpose of allowing such construction, act was not severable but entire act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendants contended that the ordinance made the peaceful enjoyment of the right of freedom of speech and assembly upon the public streets of the city contingent on the uncontrolled will or whim of the chief of police. The court agreed, finding no language in the ordinance that warranted it in drawing any implication therefrom in favor of the ordinance's constitutionality. Without any preamble, explanation, or qualifying words whatsoever, it vested the absolute control of parades in the chief of police.

The court concluded that: (1) the right to create special purpose districts by special acts included necessarily the incidental right to provide methods for financing projects committed to them, whether in the manner of an ad valorem tax or otherwise; and (2) the hearing provided for each property owner, after due notice, and before the imposition of any assessment, meets the requirement of due process under the state and federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. III, &sect; 34(9). There was no attempt to delegate to any local agency the power to enact penal ordinances. The delegation of power was limited to the adoption of reasonable regulations which were enforceable by application to any court of competent jurisdiction for the exercise of mandatory injunctions or other remedial orders. If any regulation was adopted which was generally unreasonable the court would not enforce it. Since the sewer charge was for a service rendered, and did not constitute an assessment, no hearing had to be provided for property owners before the imposition of the charge.

Both parties agreed that the solemn-form requirement referred to a requirement in the foreign court. The court accepted the widow's argument that there could be no contest in South Carolina as there could no longer be any in Ohio. Per Ohio Revised Probate Code, &sect; 2741.09, where there was an action to contest the probating of a will, it could not be sustained unless it was brought by six months after the probating of the will except where the contestant was under a disability. The probating was conclusive as the son did not contest the probating during the Ohio six-month period. Besides &sect; 19-286, the court's decision was also based on comity.

The court found that, because &sect;&sect; 20-305 through 20-309 of the 1952 Code of Laws of South Carolina had been specifically repealed, those provisions of the general law could not be in conflict with the special law.

On appeal, the court declared that its only duty was to determine whether or not the Act in question was clearly unconstitutional, beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that there was, in effect, an applicable general law and no showing in the present record before it of any sufficient distinction, need, or justification for the special legislation. The court, therefore, concluded that, beyond any reasonable doubt, that 1961 S.C. Acts 601 was unconstitutional and in violation of S.C. Const. art.

The white persons left, but the blacks refused to leave; and those above the age of 16 were charged with trespass. S.C.

An appeal was taken. The Supreme Court, Oxner, J., held that mandatory features of the acts whereby the City of Columbia would be required annually to levy ad valorem taxes sufficient to defray its share of operating deficit were violative of constitutional provision that no municipal corporation shall be subject to any restrictions not applicable to all corporations of same class and such provisions rendered both acts unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The Operating Deficit Act directed that the counties and the city should levy annually an ad valorem tax sufficient to cover any operating deficit of the District. The court held the circuit court properly found that this requirement, with respect to the city, violated Article 2, &sect; 13, and Article 8, &sect; 7 of the Constitution, that such invalidity was inseparable from the requirement as to the counties, and that therefore the whole provision regarding the annual levy of taxes was unconstitutional. However, the District Act was also unconstitutional. It was mandatory upon the counties and the city to enter into the undertaking to pay one-third of the principal amount of any bonds. Article 8, &sect; 1 of the Constitution prohibited the general assembly from imposing restrictions on one city that were not imposed on other cities of the same class.

The court further found that under S.C.

The court held that the landowners failed to carry that burden of proof and that the power companies established by uncontradicted evidence a need in good faith for the fee to the lands sought to be condemned.

The owners filed exceptions to the trial court order enjoining the operation of their school. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected the owners' contention that the zoning ordinance was not valid because the city had not been in existence at the time it was passed, finding that the owners could not collaterally attack the existence of the city. The court found that the owners were not entitled to a non-conforming use exemption for the operation of their school, nor were they entitled to a customary home occupation exemption. The court decided that the owners' use of their home as a school was purely commercial and bore no relation to any usual and ordinary home purpose.

They were charged with staging a parade without a permit in violation of a city ordinance. At trial before the municipal court, defendants were convicted as charged.

The circuit court affirmed their convictions, and defendants sought further review, again raising a constitutional challenge. In affirming, the court concluded that, while the right to engage in a parade was the exercise of the fundamental right of free speech and assembly, such a right was subject to reasonable regulation and limitation. The ordinance at issue was not unconstitutional because it was not designed to suppress any fundamental freedom but was intended to reasonably regulate the use of the streets in the public interest.

The Court of Common Pleas, Richland County, James Hugh McFaddin, J., denied the landowner's motions to dismiss the proceeding or to obtain a separate trial to determine her damages, and the landowner appealed. The Supreme Court, Lewis, J., held that the lessees had an interest in the land by virtue of the lease and, therefore, were properly made parties to the proceeding, and that the landowner was not entitled to a separate trial, in the absence of a showing of legal prejudice in the case of a joint trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas, Richland County (South Carolina) denying her motions to dismiss the proceeding or to obtain a separate trial to determine her damages in connection with a complaint by respondent South Carolina State Highway Department to condemn her land for highway purposes. At issue, inter alia, was whether the landowner was entitled to a trial separate from that involving her lessees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the Department sought to obtain a right-of-way over the land in suit, both the landowner and her lessees were made parties to the suit. After the landowner and the lessees rejected an award made after an administrative hearing, a de novo trial in the common pleas court was ordered. When the case was called, however, the lessees failed to appear, and the landowner moved for a separate trial and for other relief. The common pleas court denied relief, and the landowner appealed. The court affirmed. First, it held that, pursuant to &sect; 33-132 of the 1952 Code of Laws of South Carolina, the lessees were properly joined as parties to the condemnation proceeding because of their interest in the land by reason of the lease. Second, the ruling denying a separate trial on the landowner's damages was proper. That was because a common pleas court was not required in a condemnation proceeding to allow a separate trial to each owner of an estate or interest in the land condemned unless a landowner showed that legal prejudice would result by reason of a joint trial. Where, as here, no such showing was made, there was no basis for the granting of a separate trial on the issue of damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the lessees were properly made parties to the proceeding, and that the landowner was not entitled to a separate trial in the absence of a showing of legal prejudice in the case of a joint trial, which showing the landowner failed to make. The court thereupon rendered judgment on the order denying the motions.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court agreed and declared the Act unconstitutional. In reaching its conclusion, the court rejected respondents' claim that an election was not required because the debt would not exceed the constitutional limit for the county. The court held that no such condition was stated in the amendment and that there was nothing to show that the legislature intended such a condition to apply to trigger the amendment's election requirement.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The law at issue being challenged by the taxpayer was the State Appropriation Act of 1954 (Act).

Defendants agreed with the taxpayer's assertion, but stated that only this specific part of the Act should be deleted. The court agreed with defendants and ruled that even if this part of the Act was deleted that it was still a complete and valid law. The court rejected defendants claim that the Act violated S.C.

The court ruled that the Act did not levy a tax, and instead simply dealt with a surplus if in fact a surplus existed at the end of the fiscal year.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contended, first, that the statutes did not authorize the annexation of an incorporated town, second, that the petition for election was not signed by a majority of the freeholders, and, third, that the election was invalid. Defendants presented the sustaining ground that the action should have been dismissed for plaintiffs' failure to give bond. The court reversed. It found that the first question had to be resolved against the contention of plaintiffs. The court noted that no obligation attached to those signing the petition and, therefore, there was no obligation to ratify. It found, however, that a certain amount of responsibility did attach; responsibility to give the matter at hand due consideration and responsibility to one's co-signer and other residents of the area affected. The court found that the names on the petition when filed and acted upon by the annexing body could not be thereafter ratified. The court concluded that it was evident that, unless the questioned names were counted, the petition was deficient in that it was not by a majority of the freeholders of the territory to be annexed.</SPAN></P>

The company stated that it did not contribute to the cost of constructing the original bridge and had derived no benefits therefrom, so it would not pay for any part of the bridge's reconstruction. The court held that the referee's order of nonsuit was affirmed because the Department's claim was time-barred and because the statutory basis for the Department's charge to the company did not apply where no grade crossing was being eliminated. Consequently, the company was not liable for the costs sought to be imposed by the Department, and the Department had exceeded its authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission issued an order declaring the Greenville-Spartanburg market area a &quot;controlled market&quot; and fixing minimum prices to be charged for milk by producers, distributors, and retailers in that area. The primary ground of the demurrer was that the price-fixing provisions of The Act of May 11, 1955, 49 Stat. at L. 496, and of the Commission's orders issued by virtue thereof denied the retail grocer the due process and equal protection guaranteed by Article 1, Section 5 of the Constitution of South Carolina. The issue presented was whether the State could fix the price at which a retail grocer could sell milk. The court noted that the right of the State to regulate and control the production and distribution of milk with regard to sanitation and purity was not in question. The court further noted that the only provision of the Act that was challenged was that which purported to empower the Commission to dictate to a retail grocer the minimum price at which he could sell wholesome milk that he had purchased from a distributor at the latter's price. The court concluded, in its affirmance, that the police power of the State did not extend so far.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's motion to dismiss was overruled and he was sentenced to pay a fine or serve 30 days in jail. The court noted that the very nature of a pinball machine was conducive to wagering or gaming. The legislature had a right to regulate through licensing the operation of such machines under its police power. The legislature could require the operation of pinball machines to be conducted in such a way as not to be obnoxious to public health, manners, or morals. The court concluded that South Carolina Code &sect; 5-624.2 (1952) (Supp.) did not prohibit the carrying on of a legal business but was instead a permissible regulation of such business under the police power of the state; such police power could be exercised for the benefit of the public safety, health, peace, morals, or general welfare.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The theater owners challenged the application of a state statute, S.C.

The plaintiffs argued that the statute was an invalid restraint upon free speech and in conflict with the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and with S.C.

The court affirmed, holding that the statute's prohibition of &quot;plays&quot; and &quot;interludes&quot; encompassed the showing of motion pictures. According to the court, the statute was a legitimate exercise of the police power based on promoting the general welfare by having a day of rest from customary labor. The court also found the statute to be constitutional. If good and sufficient police reasons underlay the statute, and substantial police purposes were involved, these reasons and purposes constituted its civil and legal justification, whether they were or not the direct and immediate motives. Further, in the exercise of the police power of the state there was no invasion of the theater owners' constitutional rights of free speech.</SPAN></P>

The circuit judge issued his stay order, conditioned upon the filing of a supersedeas bond, which was done. The employee appealed. The court found that the circuit court judge's order was erroneous to the extent that it purported to stay payment of weekly compensation from the date of the Commission's award until the determination by this court of the employer's appeal on the merits. However, the employee could derive no benefit from that error because the court determined that her claim was barred by the statutory limitation and therefore not compensable. Reversal of the order under appeal, for such error, would be a futile gesture, because although on the one hand the employer would be obligated to make such payment, on the other, the employee would be simultaneously obligated to make restitution of the amount so received.

They involved the construction and constitutionality of certain legislative enactments that had not been judicially construed, the validity of certain regulations of the hospital contended by the radiologists to be discriminatory and invalid, and the propriety of the computation of charges to charity in the calculation of the cost of operating the hospital's radiological department.

The Common Pleas Court, Laurens County, George T. Gregory, Jr., J., entered judgment declaring act to be valid, and plaintiff appealed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Act No. 462 of the 1959 Acts of the General Assembly authorized for Laurens County the issuance of bonds for permanent improvements to in part county roads. The 1921 amendment to Article X, &sect; 5 of the South Carolina Constitution spoke of authorizing Laurens County to vote bonds. Appellant argued that under the Constitution, an election was required because Act No. 4632 authorized bond issuance without an election. Respondents argued that the word &quot;vote&quot; in the constitutional amendment meant issue. The court disagreed. Part of the court's rationale was based on legislation that followed the constitutional amendment. The legislature interpreted the constitutional amendment as requiring elections. The court cited Act No. 355 (XXXII Stat. at L. 679), Act No. 354 (XXXII Stat. at L. 677), and Act No. 356 (XXXII Stat. at L. 681). The latter two authorized the issuance of county bonds, but the issuance had to be submitted to qualified electors of the respective counties. The court also relied on the language of the Act of the Legislature approved March 23, 1926 (XXXIV Stat. at L. 1594) even though it had decided that the language in that law provided for an insufficient election.</SPAN></P>

Under the Act, the right to contract with outside customers given by &sect; 59-531 of the 1952 South Carolina Code to all municipalities was denied to Gaffney. It had no voice in fixing the rates to be charged to such customers. The court held that the Act, as amended by Act No. 373 of the 1959 Acts of the South Carolina General Assembly, May 28, 1959, 51 St. at L. 741, violated Article 8, &sect;&sect; 1 and 5 of the South Carolina Constitution, which provided that no municipal corporation could be subject to any restrictions other than all corporations of the same class and which granted to all municipalities within the state the right to acquire and operate a waterworks system.

The Board determined that the additional license would not promote the convenience of the community based on the population of the area, and it denied the application. The county court reversed because it found the Board had relied on old population statistics. On review, the court determined that the licensing and regulation of small loan companies was an exercise of the police power and essentially a legislative and administrative function. Thus, although S.C. Code &sect; 8-794.163 gave the court the authority to set aside a decision of the Board, the constitutional requirement as to separation of powers limited the court's review. Whether small loan companies served the public interest and, if so, whether experience justified a restriction on the number licensed were not considerations for the courts.</SPAN></P>

The ballot contained a stipulation that exempted all parcels of undeveloped real estate in the area to be annexed in excess of 10 acres owned by any person from taxation until the property was developed or divided into lots. While the trial court based its decree on Act No. 886 of the General Assembly of 1956, 49 Stat. 2140 (South Carolina), the court observed that there was no evidence that a governing body took any implemental action.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, which sustained the city's demurrer to the landowner's action to enjoin the proceedings against her. The court held that a party aggrieved by the application of an ordinance was required to invoke and exhaust the administrative remedies provided thereby before she could resort to the courts for relief.

However, the court affirmed the overruling of the hospital's demurrer because the administrator had clearly denied the obligation of the patient for the bill. Also, it was not error to overrule the demurrer as to the administrator's affirmative defense that claimed that the patient's bill arose because her stay was lengthened by the hospital's own negligence because, though immune form suit, the hospital voluntarily submitted itself to the trial court's jurisdiction and rendered available as a defense whatever claim the administrator had available that grew out of the same transaction as the hospital's suit.</SPAN></P>

Only two counties had populations in excess of 65,000, and the merchants contended that the population limitation caused the statute to be special legislation in contravention of S.C. Const. art. III, &sect; 34, subd. IX. The court reversed a trial court judgment that had declared the statute to be constitutional. It found that the conditions in the two counties that allegedly justified the legislation existed in all thickly settled areas. If the Legislature intended to remedy a condition peculiar to large, congested, unincorporated areas, there was no good reason for not extending the act to similar areas in other sections of the state. Moreover, the act was not confined to major cities but extended to rural sections in both counties, and there was no difference between conditions in those sections and conditions in adjoining counties. If there was need for further restriction on fireworks, it existed throughout the state and not just in the two largest counties.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the legislation could be justified only upon the theory that it constituted a reasonable and proper exercise of the inherent police power of the state, and pointed out that such power could only be exercised where it was reasonably necessary in the interests of the public order, health, safety, morals, or general welfare. The court held that that there was no justification for the legislation based upon considerations of the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. The court concluded that the Fair Trade Act, id., insofar as it applied to the retailer, was unconstitutional upon the grounds that the Fair Trade Act, id., constituted a deprivation of property without due process of law in violation of S.C.

Therefore, such removal could be provided by the legislature, which was done pursuant to 49 St. at Large, p. 1841 (S.C.). In addition, the court determined that although the Governor did not have unlimited power of removal or the power of arbitrary and indefinite suspension, because the suspension was within the contemplation of art. 3, &sect; 27 of the South Carolina Constitution, as to incapacity, misconduct, or neglect of duty as authorized by 49 St. at Large, p. 1841 (S.C.), and because the suspension was neither arbitrary nor indefinite, it was proper as a provision was made for the exercise of the power in the interim. Finally, the court concluded that 49 St. at Large, p. 1841 (S.C.) was not unconstitutional, did not deny due process or equal protection of the laws, and was not a delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court, T. B.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Act declared constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMPLAINT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs complaining of the defendant allege:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs are citizens of the United States of America and the State of South Carolina and are officers and members of the South Carolian Naturopathic Association, Inc., a Corporation created under the laws of the State of South Carolina. This action is brought by plaintiffs in their official capacity, and also individually for the benefit of themselves and all members of the Association and all duly licensees who are practicing in the State under a duly issued and lawful license. Membership in the Association is confined solely and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  exclusively to regularly licensed Naturopathic Practitioners in South Carolina. Doctors M. S. Dantzler and J. B. Branyon and W. T. Bidwell are the Board of Examiners. All of the plaintiffs as individuals have been naturopathic physicians under the law of South Carolina since 1937. All of the licensed Naturopathic Physicians in South Carolina, except the last ten licensees, were admitted to practice in compliance with the law prior to June, 1946. The last ten practitioners were admitted under the amended Naturopathy Act of 1949, which greatly increased the education and professional qualification of applicants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The defendant, Honorable T. C. Callison, is Attorney General of South Carolina, and is made a party defendant in pursuance of Section 10-2008 of the South Carolina Code of 1952, as this is an action seeking a declaratory judgment as to the rights of the plaintiffs and to declare unconstitutional the Act of the General Assembly of South Carolina as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An Act To Repeal Sections 56-901 Through 56-919, Code Of Laws Of South Carolina, 1952, Relating To The Practice of Naturopathy; To Make It Unlawful For Certain Persons To Practice Naturopathy In This State; And&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To Provide Penalties For Violating The Provisions Of This Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body of the Act reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 1. Sections 56-901 through 56-919, Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1952, are hereby repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 2. It shall be unlawful for any person whether heretofore licensed or not under the laws of this or any other state to practice naturopathy in this State; Provided, however, that any person now authorized to practice naturopathy in South Carolina who is a graduate of an accredited college for pre-medical training and who has, in addition thereto, graduated from a medical college recognized at the time of his graduation by the state in which it was located, and who has heretofore for a period in excess of five years engaged in the practice of medicine in the State of South Carolina under the supervision of a licensed medical doctor by special request or by special permission of the State Board of Medical Examiners, or agents thereof, shall be examined by the State Board of Medical Examiners on the same basis as other applicants to the Board are examined, and upon the making of a passing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grade on this examination, shall be licensed to practice medicine in this State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 3. Any person violating the provisions of Section 2 of this act shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be fined not exceeding five hundred dollars or be imprisoned for a period of not exceeding one year or both in the discretion of the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 4. All acts or parts of acts inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 5. This act shall take effect upon its approval by the Governor. [In the Senate House the 23rd day of February In the Year of Our Lord One Thousand Nine Hundred and Fifty-six.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiffs allege that the act in question is in violation of their rights as citizens of the United States of America and of South Carolina as provided in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution in that it deprives the plaintiffs of their property and property rights without due process of law, and denies them of the equal protection of the laws and is arbitrary and discriminatory in that it singles out naturopathy, one of a number of special practitioners in the art of healing and abolishes their profession only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Plaintiffs further allege that the Act in question violates the following provisions of the Constitution of the State of South Carolina: Article 1, Section 5; Article 1, Section 17, and Section 17, Article 3 in that said Act deprives plaintiffs of their property and property rights without due process of law and denies them of the equal protection of the laws and is arbitrary and discriminatory in that it singles out naturopathy, one of a number of special practitioners in the art of healing and abolishes their profession only. With reference to Section 17, Article 3 of the Constitution of South Carolina of 1895 plaintiffs allege that the Act violates this Section in that it relates to more than one subject which is not expressed in the title. The proviso in the Act deals with a specific provision for the licensing of medical doctors, which in no way has any connection with the title of the Act and such proviso discriminates within the Naturopathic Practitioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Plaintiffs further allege that all of the Naturopathic Physicians in South Caarolina entered the practice as a means of livelihood for themselves and to support their families. They have invested much time and great&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sums of money, more or less, in perfecting themselves for the practice of their profession. Section 56-901 of the South Carolina Code of 1952 defines Naturopathy as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Naturopathy' is hereby defined to mean the use and practice of phychological, mechanical and material health sciences to aid in purifying, cleaning and normalizing human tissues for preservation or restoration of health according to the fundamental principles of anatomy, physiology and applied psychology, as may be required. Naturopathic practice employs, among other agencies, heat, light, water, electricity, psychology, diet, massage and other manipulative methods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naturopathy has been recognized by the Legislative Law of South Carolina since the Medical Practice Act of March 10, 1920, and to do the things permitted under the Act of necessity requires the use of equipment for the employment of such agencies as heat, light, water, electricity, psychology, diet, massage and other manipulative methods and all of the plaintiffs and those whom they represent have spent large amounts of money, more or less, in the purchase of necessary equipment, which they use in the practice of their profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Plaintiffs recognize the right of the Legislature to regulate their profession by the passage of any regulatory methods within the constitutional limits. Plaintiffs allege, however, that the above entitled Act destroys their profession and means of livelihood and would make acts which are perfectly lawful to become criminal acts subject to punishment by the court upon conviction. The Act in question is prohibitory and not regulatory in a field of Medical practice and/or art of healing that could be and can be properly regulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. That plaintiffs are entitled to have the Supreme Court declare their rights and to pass upon the constitutionality of the above statute and to further declare the same null and void because of its violation of plaintiffs' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherefore, plaintiffs pray for relief as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) A judgment of this Court declaring the aforesaid Act to be unconstitutional and therefore null and void;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) For a judgment by the Court declaring the rights of the plaintiffs and to order and command the Attorney General and all law enforcement officers in the State of South Carolina not to in any manner interfere with the plaintiffs in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  practice of their lawful profession;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) For such other and further relief as the plaintiffs may be entitled to under the circumstances of this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANSWER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Defendant, T. C. Callison, Attorney General of the State of South Carolina, answering the Complaint herein, respectfully shows to the Court:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. That he denies all allegations of the Complaint not hereinafter admitted, qualified or explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That, upon information and belief, he admits the allegations of Paragraph 1 of the Complaint.</SPAN></P>

The defendant admits that Sec. 56-901 of the 1952 Code of the State as amended, reads as set out and that Naturopathy has been recognized in various forms in the State since 1920; further, upon information and belief, this defendant admits the use of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such equipment, as is referred to in Paragraph 5 of the Complaint, is employed by Naturopaths but has no knowledge of the sums invested therein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. This defendant admits so much of Paragraph 6 of the Complaint as alleges that the Act in question destroys the practice of Naturopathy as a separate cult, branch or profession of the healing art, and admits that it makes unlawful certain acts by plaintiffs, otherwise lawful, but lawful only to those qualified as general medical practitioners, or those qualified in specialized branches of the healing arts under the requirements of our laws, but the defendant alleges that the provisions of the said Act, the purpose of which is to protect the public's health and welfare, are within the police power of the State, are a valid exercise of said police power, and are neither arbitrary nor discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Further answering the Complaint, this defendant alleges that the State has a vital concern in the health of everyone within its borders, the practice of medicine and healing being one of the fields peculiarly subject to control and regulation under the police powers of this and every other government. That the practice of medicine&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and of the healing arts can be lawfully prohibited by the State except upon the conditions imposed by it, which said conditions are subject to change from time to time to keep pace with the advance of educational and scientific progress, the plaintiffs and no other persons having any fundamental or property rights to engage in any form of the healing arts free from regulation, such as is true of those employments and trades not peculiarly within the concern of the police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. That the plaintiffs have no contractual or property right granted to them by any pre-existing laws of this State allowing the practice of Naturopathy or granting licenses to them which are not subject to modification or denial in the proper exercise of the police power of the State in its promotion of the public health, plaintiffs' licenses creating in them no permanent or vested interest, such licenses not being within the inhibition against impairment of contract, and being revocable under the police power at the discretion of the sovereignty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. That the mere fact that the plaintiffs may suffer pecuniary injury because of the proper exercise of the police power of the State in forbidding the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  practice of Naturopathy in South Carolina, does not render the Act unconstitutional, because all private property is held and all callings are exercised in this State subject to the proper exercise of the police power of the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. That the prohibition of the practice of Naturopathy as a separate branch of the healing art is a proper application of the police power of the State to a particular class practicing arts peculiar to themselves, there being no means of any practical regulation due to the close and confidential nature of the relationship between the Naturopath and patient with the consequent impossibility of supervising and confining such practice within lawful bounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. That the Act in question does not prevent plaintiffs from practicing any lawful branch or type of healing formerly open to them as Naturopaths, as they may still, upon qualifying as medical doctors under the laws of this State, practice all lawful forms of healing and treatment, the Act making special provisions for those who have had proper medical training to take the examinations provided for medical doctors, with other laws leaving open the taking of these examinations by those who qualify&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  themselves therefor hereafter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. That the Act attacked by the plaintiffs applies equally to all persons now practicing Naturopathy and that said classification is reasonable, operating alike on all within its provisions. That the Act is not discriminatory and does not deny the equal protection of the law to those within the class upon which it operates, there being no duty upon the State to recognize all peculiar schools and groups of those seeking to practice healing arts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. That the practice of medicine is not a Federal privilege or immunity within the purview of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and is peculiarly within the control of the State and not of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. That the title of the Act clearly shows its purpose and discloses to anyone interested that it is prohibiting the practice of Naturopathy in this State, relating to that one subject or matters fully germane thereto, in accordance with the provisions of Article III, Section 17 of the Constitution of this State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherefore, this defendant prays that the Honorable Court do adjudge and decree that the Act in question is constitutional and valid in all respects&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and binding upon the plaintiffs and all others seeking to practice any form of the so-called Naturopathic Profession.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an association of naturopathic physicians and its president, sought a declaration to defendant Attorney General that &quot;An Act To Repeal &sect;&sect; 56-901-56-919, Code Of Laws Of South Carolina, 1952, Relating To The Practice Of Naturopathy; To Make It Unlawful For Certain Persons To Practice Naturopathy In This State; And To Provide Penalties For Violating The Provisions Of This Act&quot; was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that they represented licensed naturopathic physicians who were admitted to practice in compliance with the law prior to June, 1946. They sought a declaratory judgment as to their rights, contending that the Act to repeal the prior law was in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States in that it deprived them of their property rights without due process of law and denied equal protection of the law. They asserted that the Act in dispute was arbitrary and discriminatory in singling out naturopathy. The court found no merit to the claims. The court concluded that the State had an interest in regulating and licensing health practitioners. The new law repealed prior provisions pertaining to the profession, and it put in place new and additional licensing requirements needed to protect the public. The disputed law was a valid exercise of the State's police powers. The court noted that naturopathy was of comparatively recent recognition and that the State has the right to control the practice in the field.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who were husband and wife, were tried and convicted in the Court of General Sessions for Georgetown County (South Carolina) upon an indictment charging possession of alcoholic liquor in their place of business, which was not a licensed liquor store, a violation of South Carolina Code 1952, &sect; 4-95. The husband was sentenced to serve two years in jail and the wife one. They appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer, while checking defendants' store, went behind the counter and found whiskey. He then walked into an adjacent room, and he testified that he found there a bag on the floor with whiskey in it. He testified that the husband then attacked him; his pistol fell to the floor; the wife grabbed the pistol and ran; when he freed himself, he went and called for help; and when a second officer arrived, they found neither the husband nor the liquor. Defendants disputed the officer's testimony as to what took place in the room. On the instant appeal, the court held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing a motion for continuance made on the ground that publication of indictments against defendants for assault and battery and grand larceny, presumably within the jury panel's hearing, was prejudicial. It held that the trial judge did not err in overruling defendants' objections to the officer's testimony as to the attack and as to the disappearance of the liquor. The court found no merit in exceptions that charged that the trial judge erred in charging the jury the rule of law as to aiders and abettors and that charged that the sentences were excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient's wife filed an application to adjudge the patient insane. The patient was examined by two physicians, and the Probate Court issued an order adjudging him insane and committing him to the State Hospital. Less than three months later, the patient filed an application with the trial court for a writ of habeas corpus. He claimed that he had been illegally committed to the State Hospital and that he was not insane and could establish his sanity upon a fair and impartial hearing. The superintendent asserted that the writ should be discharged because respondent had not exhausted the remedy available to him under &sect; 32-930 of the 1952 Code, 1955 Supplement (S.C.). The trial court overruled that contention and adjudged the patient sane and ordered his release. The superintendent appealed, and the court reversed the trial court's judgment. A writ of habeas corpus could not be converted into an inquisition of lunacy if by statute an adequate remedy was provided whereby one that had been adjudged insane could litigate the issue of his return to sanity. Such a remedy was available in the Act of March 7, 1952, 1955 Code Supplement, &sect;&sect; 32-909 through 32-932 (S.C.).</SPAN></P>

The members' terms of office had not expired, and they sought to prevent the city from enforcing the repeal. On review, the court found that the city should have prevailed because it had the power to repeal such an ordinance. The members had no vested constitutional, contractual rights preventing such a repeal, nor was there any statutory bar to the repeal. The city's authorization under its charter to establish the Civil Service Commission was permissive. Under Article 2, &sect; 47-721 et seq., Code of 1952, the city could by ordinance provide for a Civil Service Commission.

In addition, the power to collect taxes due to the city from its citizens could not be delegated by the city without express statutory authority, and a fortiori the power to collect taxes could not be exercised by a private citizen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Action to recover under life insurance certificate issued by fraternal benefit association. The Common Pleas Court, York County, Joseph R. Moss, J., overruled plaintiff's demurrer to answer, and plaintiff appealed. The Supreme Court, Legge, J., held that statute providing that insurers, after two years from date of issuance of policy or certificate of insurance, are deemed to have waived right to dispute truth of representations in application was applicable to and binding on fraternal benefit association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reversed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAYLOR, J., and BAKER, C. J., dissented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following is the order of Judge Moss:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was brought by the plaintiff under a Summons and Complaint bearing date July 22, 1952. The complaint sets up a cause of action for recovery by the plaintiff against the defendant on a policy of life insurance in the face amount of Three Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($ 3,000.00) upon the life of William S. Pursley, the husband at that time of the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following issuance of the policy William S. Pursley died in less than six months or on the 14th day of July, 1950. Thereafter proof of death was furnished to the defendant along with the original certificate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of insurance, and demand was made for the face amount of the said policy in the sum of $ 3,000.00 to the plaintiff, as the beneficiary named in the said policy. On January 4, 1951, the defendant rejected the claim on the ground that material misrepresentations were made in the application for the benefit certificate and upon all other grounds on which this association was entitled to deny liability thereunder, and tendered to plaintiff a return of premiums paid in the amount of $ 49.02, which the plaintiff refused to accept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant by its Answer admitted it was a fraternal benefit society incorporated under the laws of the State of Nebraska, with a lodge system, a ritualistic form of work, and a representative form of government; without capital stock, and transacts its business without profit for the sole benefit of its members and their beneficiaries. The Answer alleges that such fraternal benefit societies are governed by specific statutes applying to them, and exempting it from the general insurance laws of the State of South Carolina; that the Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Society is authorized and licensed to transact business in South Carolina as a fraternal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  benefit association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Answer admits that benefit certificate No. 2104736, a preferred risk whole life certificate, in the principal sum of $ 3,000.00, was issued to William S. Pursley on January 27, 1950, and admits that the plaintiff Vera Hall Pursley, was named beneficiary in the said certificate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Answer admits that William S. Pursley departed this life on July 14, 1950, but specifically denied that the certificate issued to the said William S. Pursley was in force at the time of his death, and the defendant further alleges that certain material misrepresentations were made by William S. Pursley on January 16, 1950, in the application for such certificate, and in accordance with the terms thereof, the said certificate issued was null and void, and the defendant has, therefore, refused to pay the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Answer further alleges that in the written application for membership in the defendant society, and for the issuance to him of a preferred risk whole life certificate in the sum of $ 3,000.00 there appeared a number of questions and answers, including whether the applicant had ever used alcoholic liquors to excess, or taken treatment for liquor habit; had ever&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been under the observation, care or treatment in any hospital, sanitorium, or similar institution; whether the applicant in the past ten years had any mental or bodily disease or infirmity, or had consulted, been attended, or examined by any physician; whether the applicant had, or had ever, had high blood pressure, paralysis, tuberculosis, diabetes, or other chronic disease; or any other disease, and whether the applicant was then in good health, all of which questions were answered &quot;No&quot;, and that the applicant further declared in writing in the said application that he had read the foregoing questions and answers thereto, and represented that each of the said answers is full, complete, and true. That upon receipt and acceptance of the said written application the Society, relying upon the statements and representations, including the answers under the heading of &quot;Personal History&quot; as made by the said William S. Pursley, issued to him its preferred risk whole life certificate No. 2104736 under date of January 27, 1950, in the amount of $ 3,000.00. That under the terms of the benefit certificate, the constitution, laws and by-laws of the Society constitute a part thereof, and it is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  expressly provided in the said certificate that &quot;this certificate is issued in consideration of the application therefor, including the statement of insurability, a copy of which is attached hereto and made a part hereof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant further alleged upon information and belief that the answers to the questions set out in the application were untrue; that the applicant, William S. Pursley, prior to January 16, 1950, had used alcoholic liquors to excess, had suffered from hypertension or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis of the liver, had consulted physicians, and had been under their care and treatment in and out of hospitals, suffered from high blood pressure, and was not in good health at the time of making the said application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the said certificate upon which the plaintiff's claim was issued by the defendant in reliance upon the truth of the material representations, which were untrue, and that in accordance with the terms of the application, the benefit certificate, the constitution, laws, and by-laws, the certificate was null and void, and asked that the Complaint be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this Answer the plaintiff demurred to the Answer upon the following&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grounds:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. That the Answer of the defendant sets up and alleges as a sole defense to the cause of action stated in the Complaint an averment that material misrepresentations affecting the risk and hazard assumed by the defendant society was made by the insured in his application for insurance and that as a result thereof the policy admittedly issued is null and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That such defense is not available to the Defendant society under the provisions of Section 37-161 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina for 1952, other applicable laws and decisions and the terms of the policy as modified thereby, as more than two years have elapsed from the date of issuance of the Certificate of insurance on the 27th day of January, 1950, no proceeding has been instituted to vacate said Certificate on such grounds and the right to interpose any such defense is therefore deemed and taken to have been waived by operation of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing on the Demurrer was had before me on July 8, 1953, at which plaintiff's and defendants' attorneys appeared and made full argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to pass upon the validity of the grounds of the Demurrer it is necessary and enlightening to review the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  history of Section 37-161 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina for 1952, commencing with Section 7986 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina for 1942, which is as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When may dispute truth of application and representations for life insurance, disability, etc.--All life insurance companies, fraternal benefit associations or any other company, corporation or association by whatever name known, who issues a policy or certificate of insurance on the life of a person shall, after a period of two (2) years from the date of such policy or certificate of insurance, be deemed and taken to have waived any right they may have had to dispute the truth of the application for insurance, or that the assured person had made false representations shall be deemed and taken to be true; provided, that where any such policy shall contain, in addition to life insurance, agreements for indemnity or benefits for disability, or any other coverage, the provisions of this section shall apply to such agreements with the same force and effect as to the life insurance coverage of such policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Section was repealed by Act No. 232, page 322, of the Acts and Joint Resolutions of 1947, and replaced&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by Section 51 of Article I, on page 344 of the Acts of 1947, which reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When May Dispute Truth of Application and Represensations for Life Insurance, Disability, Etc.--misstatement of age.--All companies, which issue a policy or certificate of insurance on the life of a person shall, after a period of two (2) years from the date of such policy or certificate of insurance, be deemed and taken to have waived any right they may have had to dispute the truth of the application for insurance, or that the assured person had made false representations and the said application and representations shall be deemed and taken to be true: Provided, that this Section shall not apply to the misstatement of age by the insured: Provided, Further, that where any such policy shall contain, in addition to life insurance, agreements for indemnity or benefits for disability, or any other coverage, the provisions of this Section shall apply to such agreements with the same force and effect as to the life insurance coverage of such policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter a further amendment of Section 7986 of the 1942 Code was made by Act No. 838 appearing on page 2041 of the Acts of 1950, which amendment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  left the Section exactly as provided in the Acts of 1947 except a change was made in the proviso with reference to misstatement of age. This Section 7986 of the Code of 1942 as amended by the Acts of 1947 and 1950, supra, was re-enacted and incorporated as Section 37-161 of the 1952 Code, upon which the plaintiff's Demurrer is based. It will be noted that the wording of Section 7986, Code of Laws of 1942, is much clearer, stronger and more implicit, because it contains the words &quot;all life insurance companies, fraternal benefit associations or any other company, corporation or association by whatever name known.&quot; While in Section 37-161 of the Code of Laws of 1952 the words &quot;life insurance companies, fraternal benefit associations or any other company, corporation or association by whatever name known&quot; are omitted, and that in title 37-161 of the 1952 Code of Laws all references to fraternal benefit associations or societies are omitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In paragraph entitled 37-857, Code of Laws of 1952, at page 398; in Chapter entitled &quot;Fraternal Benefit Associations&quot; which defines fraternal benefit associations, a class under which the defendant admittedly comes, the following provision is found: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;General insurance law inapplicable. Fraternal benefit associations as defined in this chapter shall be governed by the provisions hereof and the general insurance laws of this State shall not apply to such associations unless express provision therefor is made in any such law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reading of Title 37-161, Code of Laws of 1952, will clearly show that no express provision in such Statute or general insurance law is made for fraternal benefit associations, such as the defendant herein admittedly is, and, therefore, I find and hold that the provisions of Title 37-161, 1952 Code of Laws, which is the general insurance law, is not applicable to the defendant in this case, a fraternal benefit association or society, and the Demurrer of the plaintiff to the Answer of the Defendant is hereby overruled and dismissed. See Stewart v. Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Society, 195 S.C. 365, 11 S.E.2d 449; Robertson v. Fraternal Union of America, 85 S.C. 221, 67 S.E. 247; Powell v. Gary, 200 S.C. 154, 20 S.E.2d 391; Murray v. Sovereign Camp, Woodmen of the World, 192 S.C. 101, 5 S.E.2d 560. All of which is duly ordered.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff beneficiary's action to recover under a life insurance certificate issued by defendant fraternal benefit association, the Common Pleas Court, York County (South Carolina), overruled the beneficiary's demurrer to the association's answer that the certificate was void because of untrue representations made in the application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The benefit association rejected the beneficiary's claim under the life insurance certificate on the ground that the holder of the certificate had made material misrepresentations concerning the state of his health. The beneficiary argued that the association was estopped from pleading the bar by &sect; 37-161 of the 1952 Code of Laws, which stated that any company issuing a life insurance policy was deemed to have waived any right to dispute the truth of the application if it had not done so within two years of its issuance. The lower court overruled the beneficiary's demurrer to the association's answer, but the court reversed. The court found that &sect; 37-161 was applicable to the association. Although the statute was originally applicable only to life insurance companies, it was expressly made applicable to fraternal benefit associations. No change of legislative intent was made evident when the early acts were codified and no substantial change of language occurred in the process of codification. The court held that the history of the legislation left no doubt that the association was bound by the statute.</SPAN></P>

The Common Pleas Court of Darlington County, J. Woodrow Lewis, J., entered an order refusing motion of defendant bottling company to transfer the action to Florence County, and the bottling company appealed. The Supreme Court, Baker, C. J., held that bottling company, which had its principal place of business in Florence County, and which sold crates of bottled soft drinks in Darlington County, under arrangement whereby customers made deposits on bottles and crates and received their deposits back when crates and bottles were returned about three days later to Florence County, did not &quot;own property&quot; in Darlington County within meaning of statute providing that service on a domestic corporation in any county where it shall &quot;own property&quot; and transact business, shall be effective and confer jurisdiction over the corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An action was brought for damages resulting from collision of trucks. The bottling company had been held subject to the jurisdiction of the county on the ground that it owned property and transacted business there. It was a domestic corporation with its principal place of business in another county and a resident of that county within the meaning of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 10-303 (1952). The bottling company argued that it did not own property in the county where the suit was brought within the meaning of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 10-421 (1952). It claimed that the whole purpose of its deposit arrangement was for the speedy rotation of bottles from plant to customer and back to plant and to make their stay in any county, other than where its plant was located, as brief and transitory as possible. The court reversed the order of the trial court that denied the motion for transfer and held that property so transitory in a county was not ownership of the property within the meaning of &sect; 10-421. It was far-fetched to say that a domestic corporation was subject to suit in every county of the state wherein an empty soft drink bottle or crate came to rest briefly, pending return to the bottler for reuse.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found no violations of U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV, or S.C. Const. art. 1, &sect; 25.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two property owners, one of whom owned over 100 rental units and one of whom lived in his own property, challenged an ordinance of the City of Columbia after they were cited for violations. The property owners contended that complying with the new ordinance would cost them from $ 575 to $ 750 per dwelling. The court upheld the ordinance, stating that the cost did not constitute a taking of property because the city's policy power allowed it to insist upon reasonable standards for the public health and safety. The court further found that the hearings provided by the ordinance could properly employ relaxed rules of evidence and the court held that no jury trial was required by S.C. Const. art. 1, &sect; 25. The court, however, struck down the general portions of Section 9 of the ordinance, finding that the specific health and safety requirements were proper but that the general, expansive language granting permission to the city to demolish a structure for vague safety concerns was unenforceable. As modified, the court found the ordinance constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the city on the property owners' challenge to the housing ordinance, but modified the judgment to reflect that the vague, general powers given to the city in Section 9 could not be enforced.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court, Legge, J., held that statute declaring that any city of over 5,000 inhabitants shall be liable for all damages done to property of any citizen thereof, or property holder therein, by any of its officers, agents or servants did not deprive a farmer, who was not a citizen, of any right of action against city since he had no such right prior to enactment of statute, and even if classification prescribed by statute were unreasonable or arbitrary farmer would be in no better position since constitutionality of statute would leave him without any right of action.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the city's demurrer because the complaint failed to allege that the farmer belonged to either of the two classes to whom a right of action was given under &sect; 47-379. Section 47-379 expressed a single legislative purpose, and the limitation imposed by the words &quot;thereof&quot; and &quot;therein&quot; could not be construed as a separable provision. Because the provisions of the statute were not separable, it was unnecessary to determine whether the statute violated the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions. Upon review, the court found that the trial court correctly disposed of the farmer's contention of separability. The statute did not deprive the farmer of any right of action against the city because no such right existed in his favor prior to its enactment.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court held that the annual provision in the supply acts that related to the compensation of the treasurer was invalid in its retroactive aspect because it attempted to provide compensation of a public officer after services were rendered, but it was valid prospectively. In other words, the fees on executions issued prior to July 1, 1946, accrued to the county, but thereafter to the treasurer as compensation in addition to his salary. The funds authorized to be paid to the treasurer were not public funds.

From adverse order of the County Court, Richland County, Legare Bates, County Judge, the town appealed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant town sought review of a judgment of the County Court, Richland County (South Carolina) invalidating part of an ordinance imposing license fees on sales or receipts of all merchants doing business within city limits except for certain businesses which paid a flat fee. Respondent merchants had challenged the ordinance as void under Article 8, &sect; 6 of the South Carolina Constitution and &sect; 47-271 of the 1952 Code of Laws for South Carolina.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the county court agreed with the merchants that the ordinance was invalid in its entirety by reason of the fact that it imposed a flat fee on certain businesses while other businesses had to pay a graduated tax, the town appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. First, it approved of the county court's finding that the part of the ordinance that imposed a flat fee on certain businesses was improper under the state constitution and &sect; 47-172, noting that such fees were required to be graduated as to the affected classifications. Thus, to the extent that the ordinance imposed a flat fee, it was void. However, the court held that the presence of the invalid section did not require the entire ordinance to be struck down. That was because &sect; 15 thereof specifically provided for severability. Thus, since the portion imposing the graduated fees was severable and independent, it was enforceable despite the invalidity of the other section, and it was properly allowed to stand. The court thereupon affirmed the county court to the extent it invalidated the flat fee provisions in the ordinance but reversed it as to the issue of the validity of the balance of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Under the Valued Policy Statutes the insured could recover the full value insured even though she had a limited interest worth less than the amount of the insurance.

A hospital association was also a respondent. An issue was whether or not defects in the bond-election process were substantial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Act No. 390 of 1953, 48 Stat. 692, provided for a special election to allow the County to issue general obligation bonds for hospital facilities. An election was held. Section 1 of Act No. 390 of 1953, 48 Stat. 692, allowed the leasing of the new building to the association, which was already running not-for-profit hospital facilities. Appellants claimed that the authorization to lease the new hospital building to the association was unconstitutional, under Article X of the South Carolina Constitution, as it would convert the property to a private rather than a public purpose. The court rejected the argument. The court said that its decision was controlled by a precedent, and it wrote that the County by leasing would be providing for the performance of a public, corporate function via the association. Regarding defects in the election procedure, the court found that they were not substantial and determinative of the outcome, and, hence, they did not invalidate the election. One defect was that the ballots stated, for vote designation by marking, &quot;In favor of the issue&quot; and &quot;Opposed to the issue,&quot; whereas, &sect; 2 of Title 23 of the 1952 Code directed the use of &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The County Court, Richland County, Legare Bates, J., overruled demurrer to complaint, and the tax commission appealed. The Supreme Court, Oxner, J., held that in view of fact that it is contemplated by Alcoholic Beverage Tax Statute that the tax shall be paid by the wholesaler, statute authorizing a refund to a licensee of cost of stamp affixed to goods which have been damaged and are unfit for sale, referred only to the holder of a wholesaler's license to the exclusion of a retailer, since the word &quot;refund&quot; indicated that repayment was to be made only to the one who had originally paid the tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Tax Commission sought review of an order of the County Court, Richland County (South Carolina), which overruled a demurer to respondent retail liquor dealer's action for a refund of the cost of tax stamps affixed to alcoholic beverages that were destroyed and damaged by fire. The statute dealing with the stamps was &sect; 65-1268 of the 1952 Code (South Carolina).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retail liquor dealer sought an adjudication that he was entitled to a refund representing the amount of tax stamps affixed to certain alcoholic beverages that were destroyed. The Tax Commission demurred to the complaint upon the ground that a refund could only have been made to the holder of a valid wholesaler's license. The court below concluded that the word &quot;licensee&quot; included a retail as well as a wholesale licensee, and overruled the demurrer. The narrow question presented was whether the refund provision applied to the holder of a retailer's license. The court held that the word &quot;licensee&quot; referred to a holder of a wholesaler's license mentioned in the preceding sentence. A retail licensee could not purchase goods from a manufacturer or such jobber. He could only purchase from one who held a valid wholesaler's license. As the tax was paid by the wholesaler to the Tax Commission, it was intended that such refund should have been to him alone and not to a retail licensee. If the Legislature intended to make provision for a refund of such tax to a person other than the one from whom it had been collected, it would have so expressed itself.</SPAN></P>

From an order of the Common Pleas Court, Chester County, Joseph R. Moss, J., reversing an award by the Industrial Commission, claimant appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee allegedly suffered a knee injury resulting from a near-fall as she arose from a table in the cafeteria. On appeal, the major issue was whether the employee sustained an accidental injury that arose out of and in the course of her employment. The court found no evidence that the employed suffered an injury by accident. From the employee's testimony at the hearing before the Commission at which she stated that her knee twisted as she arose, the court found that the failure of the employee's knee to function normally was the cause of her near-fall. Thus, because there was no accidental injury, the employee failed to satisfy the first prerequisite for compensation. The second issue addressed by the court was whether the employee was entitled to the temporary total disability for the period between the date of the alleged accident and the date of the hearing. The court held that because the Commission's award was reversed on appeal, the award was neither an unappealed award nor an affirmed award under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 72-357. Thus, the award could not be enforced by entry of judgment, and the employer could not be forced to pay benefits that had accrued during the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment, which had reversed an award of compensation to the employee.</SPAN></P>

The Common Pleas Court, Charleston County, William H. Grimball, J., held the enactment to be valid, and plaintiff appealed. The Supreme Court, Stukes, J., held that the enactment was valid, irrespective of whether the status of the board of township commissioners, under the legislation incorporating the township, was de jure, de facto or null and void, and revenue bonds, if and when issued in accord with act and sections of code to which it makes reference, would be valid and binding obligations of the district.</SPAN></P>

The resident also asserted that the commissioners had no legal status and could not proceed with the issuance of the proposed bonds. The gravamen of the complaint was that because of the alleged unconstitutionality of the code sections which related to the township, there would be uncertainty and confusion as to the validity of the proposed bonds and the right of the commissioners to construct, operate and maintain the waterworks. Affirming, the court ruled that there would be no such uncertainty or confusion. The revenue bonds, if and when issued, would be valid and binding obligations of the district, of the tenor and terms prescribed in the authorizing statutes. The court noted that there had been no need for the trial court to address the constitutionality of &sect; 14-1261 et seq. of the Code of 1952.</SPAN></P>

That section provided that the trial court had jurisdiction over a defaulting husband and father if at the time of the filing of a petition for support he was not residing or domiciled in the county but was found therein at such time. The court stated that a resident had a right to be sued in his own county. The court stated that if it granted without deciding the premise that the case was a special proceeding rather than an action although the husband was brought into court by service of a summons it did not follow that the general venue statute, &sect; 10-303, 1952 Code (South Carolina) was inapplicable.

The Supreme Court, Oxner, J., held that evidence was insufficient to justify variance, in absence of showing that the side yard requirement, when applied to radiologists' property, became arbitrary, confiscatory, or unduly oppressive because of conditions of the property distinguishing it from other properties similarly restricted, or that plans for proposed buildings could not be satisfactorily rearranged so as to conform to zoning regulation.</SPAN></P>

The common pleas court made an order of reference for an equitable accounting, as requested by the county. It also ordered the release to the county of segregated funds that had been held while the constitutionality of the statute was disputed. The court affirmed on appeal, finding no error. The court found that the order of reference was proper because the action was in equity and the relationship between the judge and the county was a fiduciary one. The county was not required to bring its action at law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Action by Commercial shrimp fisherman for an adjudication that certain statutory laws of state pertaining to regulation of shrimp fishing were unconstitutional. The Common Pleas Court, Beaufort County, J. Woodrow Lewis, J., rendered a judgment adverse to plaintiffs and plaintiffs appealed. The Supreme Court, Per Curiam, held that statute providing for forfeiture of boat and its rigging and equipment if boat was used to trawl for shrimp in waters of state without a license met constitutional provisions of due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Order affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following is the opinion of Judge Lewis in the Court below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certain phases of this matter have heretofore been passed on by the Federal Courts. D. C., 88 F. Supp. 482, and is before this Court by virtue of an opinion by the United States Supreme Court, 339 U.S. 321, 70 S. Ct. 640, 94 L. Ed. 877.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action is instituted by the plaintiffs, commercial shrimp fishermen, against the South Carolina State Board of Fisheries, its members and certain officers thereof, seeking an adjudication that certain statutory laws of the State of South Carolina pertaining to the regulation of shrimp fishing are unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appears that the questions raised by the pleadings concern the constitutionality of Section 3403, Code 1932, Sections 3408, as amended, 3310, 3379, as amended, and 3328, all of the 1942 Code of Laws. Under the statements by counsel of the issues to be determined, however, the questions involve only a consideration of Sections 3379, as amended by Act No. 323 of the 1949 Acts of the General Assembly, 46 St. at Large, p. 609, 3328 and 3408, as amended by Act No. 912 of the 1950 Acts of the General Assembly, 46 St. at Large, p. 2233.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the only question before me for determination in regard to Section 3408, as amended, relates to the forfeiture provisions of that Act, and the General Assembly by Act No. 912, supra, eliminated all forfeiture provisions therefrom, it is unnecessary to further consider that section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This leaves the issues arising under Sections 3379, as amended, and Section 3328. They are considered in the order named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the pertinent portions of Section 3379, as amended, it is provided that, in addition to a fine or imprisonment as provided in other sections, any boat trawling for shrimp in the waters of South Carolina, without first securing a license&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  so to do, shall be confiscated, with its rigging and equipment, to the State, and shall be sold by the State at public sale to the highest bidder for cash before the Court House door of the County in which captured, after giving 10 days notice of said sale in a newspaper published in said County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no other statutory provisions now in effect giving the right to confiscate boats or equipment used in shrimp fishing in the coastal waters of South Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be seen from the above stated provisions of Section 3379 that no right is given to confiscate property of shrimp fishermen who are licensed by the State of South Carolina under other provisions of this section. All of the plaintiffs are licensed by the State of South Carolina, and therefore no statutory right exists for the conscation of their boats, equipment, or cargo under any circumstances by the defendants, so long as they are so licensed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the plaintiffs have paid their licenses required by the statutes of this State, thereby removing any possibility of forfeiture of their property, they have no standing to raise the constitutionality of the provisions of the statute under attack. The fact that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  some third party may be effected by these provisions under attack does not give the plaintiffs the right to raise such questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, since all parties urge a decision as to the constitutionality of the forfeiture provisions of Section 3379, as amended, so that all question thereabout may be removed, and public interest dictating that such be done, I have concluded to treat the question as properly before the Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find and hold that Section 3379, as amended by Act 323 of the 1949 Acts, is valid and constitutional for the following reasons:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1: The tax features are reasonable upon a proper classification and upon proper subject matter. Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U.S. 385, 68 S. Ct. 1156, 92 L. Ed. 1460. It is within the taxing power of the State. Hay v. Leonard, 212 S.C. 81, 46 S.E.2d 653.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2: The provisions of the Act that the licensee give a sworn statement showing the name and address of the Master is certainly a valid exercise of police power of the State. No citation of authority is needed here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3: The presumption that the Captain or Master was on board the vessel at the time of the violation of any law is made a prima facie evidence rule. Such presumptions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are constitutionally valid. See 12 Am. Jur., Constitutional Law, Section 552, page 248.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4: We now come to the penalty provisions of the law relating to forfeitures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1949 Act provides first that its violator shall be fined or imprisoned as provided by Section 3407 of the 1942 Code. It goes on to provide for the confiscation of the boat, rigging and equipment if the boat, trawls without a license. This property is then to be sold after ten days public notice. I find these confiscation features, when construed with other applicable law fully constitutional for the following reasons:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a. The provisions of the Act relating to forfeitures do not violate due process. The right of the State to pass special forfeiture provisions has been sustained. C. J. Hendry Co. v. Moore, 318 U.S. 133, 63 S. Ct. 499, 87 L. Ed. 663. The State has a wide latitude of discretion in the matter of the amount of the penalty or forfeiture. This discretion is governed by the interests of the public, the normal opportunities for committing the offense and the amount necessary to secure a prompt compliance with the statutory enactment. The value of the boats owned by the plaintiffs vary from $ 4,000.00&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to $ 14,000.00 each. The volume of business done according to the plaintiffs who testified is from $ 40,000.00 to $ 60,000.00 per year. The amount of the forfeiture considered in the light of the business transacted during a year cannot be considered so excessive or unreasonable as to violate due process when taken along with all of the other considerations upon which the legislative discretion may rest. See: St. Louis, Iron Mountain, &amp; Southern Railway Company v. Williams, 251 U.S. 63, 40 S. Ct. 71, 64 L. Ed. 139.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b. Before the boat or property can be sold, there will have to be a conviction of the operator for operating without a license. The Act provides for the confiscation &quot;in addition to the punishment provided for in Section 3407.&quot; This meets the constitutional provisions of due process because it allows the parties charged a hearing and postpones a sale of the boat until determination of the criminal case against the operators, and conditions forfeiture upon a conviction of the criminal charge. Coffey v. Harlan County, 204 U.S. 659, 27 S. Ct. 305, 51 L. Ed. 666.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the owner of a boat sought to be confiscated has other remedies to test the legality of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  forfeiture. See discussion thereabout in Shipman v. DuPre, D. C., 88 F. Supp. 482, 487.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining question arises under Section 3328. It is herein provided that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shall be lawful for the inspectors to enter any and all premises, vessels, boats, houses, sheds or warehouses used in fishing or any fishing industry in the tide waters or coastal section of this State and to arrest, without warrant, all persons found actually violating the penal laws, contained in the coastal fisheries law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs attack as unconstitutional these provisions allowing inspection and arrest without warrant on the premises of the shrimpers. This statute simply gives (1) the right to go upon the premises of shrimpers for the purpose of inspection and (2) the right of arrest without warrant all persons found actually violating the laws relating to coastal fishing. Plaintiffs are licensed by the State of South Carolina and operate under State supervision. No citation of authority is necessary for the well settled principle that under these circumstances the right of reasonable inspection on the part of the proper officers violates no constitutional provision. The power to arrest without&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  warrant is not given except in those cases where the shrimpers are found actually violating the law. This is but an enactment of the well settled law that an officer may arrest without warrant for an offense committed in his presence. The position of the plaintiffs in regard to Section 3328 is without merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relief sought by the plaintiffs is conditioned upon the unconstitutionality of the Acts of the South Carolina General Assembly in question. The Court having concluded that the Acts contravene no constitutional provisions, the relief sought is denied and the complaint is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is so Ordered.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Order affirmed as modified.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, commercial shrimp fisherman, filed a complaint against respondents, the South Carolina Board of Fisheries and its members and officers, for an adjudication that certain South Carolina statutes pertaining to the regulation of shrimp fishing were unconstitutional. The fisherman filed exceptions to the order of the Common Pleas Court, Beaufort County, South Carolina, which dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fishermen claimed that &sect; 3403 of the Code of 1932; &sect; 3379 of the Code of 1942, as amended by Act No. 323 of the 1949 Acts of the General Assembly, 46 St. at L. 609; &sect;&sect; 3310 and 3328 of the Code of 1942; and &sect; 3408 of the Code of 1942, as amended by Act No. 832 of the 1948 Acts of the General Assembly, 45 St. at L. 2058, which provided for the forfeiture of a boat and its equipment if the boat was used to trawl for shrimp without a license, were unconstitutional. The fisherman also claimed that the trial court erred in dismissing their complaint. The court modified the trial court's order. The court held that all questions that were raised by the fisherman's exceptions to the trial court's order were correctly disposed of in the order. The court also held that the trial court properly found that the statutes were constitutional. The court held, however, the fisherman failed to file an exception to the trial court's order with regard to Act No. 323 of the 1949 Acts of the General Assembly, 46 St. at L. 609, and that it would render no opinion as to the constitutionality of a presumption in that statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's order by declaring that it would not render an opinion as to the constitutionality of the one statute. The court affirmed, as modified, the trial court's order dismissing the fishermen's complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Action to subject real estate for payment of debt due creditor of deceased. The Common Pleas Court, Spartanburg County, Steve C. Griffith, Jr., held in favor of defendants, and plaintiff appealed. The Supreme Court, Stukes, J., held that where wife died intestate leaving realty subject to mortgage and surviving husband more than six months after his qualification as administrator conveyed the realty and paid the mortgage with the proceeds, creditor of wife's estate who had not brought action within six months of wife's death could not subject the real estate to the payment of the debt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff creditor of a deceased brought suit against defendants, administrator of the deceased's estate, purchaser and mortgagee of property, to subject the real estate for payment of a debt due. The Common Pleas Court, Spartanburg County (South Carolina) held in favor of defendants. The creditor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditor, a mortuary service, conducted the deceased's funeral. At the time of her death, the deceased owned a house and a lot, which was subject to a mortgage. She died intestate. Over six months after her death, the administrator conveyed the deceased's property to the purchaser, who later conveyed it to the mortgagee in consideration of the assumption of indebtedness. At issue was whether the mortgagee obtained title to the property free of the claim of the deceased's creditor. Section 9033 of the Code of 1942 (South Carolina) provided for a bona fide sale or mortgage by an heir or devisee for valuable consideration after the expiration of six months following the death, free of the claims of creditors of the deceased. Further, the creditor had a statutory remedy against the deceased's estate in &sect; 9001 of the Code of 1942 (South Carolina) that it failed to pursue for more than six months. The creditor, having failed to pursue statutory remedies in a timely fashion and despite the intervening sale of the real estate by the administrator, could thus not maintain the instant suit against the administrator to compel the sale of the deceased's realty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c1"><SPAN CLASS="c4">September 22, 1952, Decided </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two suits each by William B. Bookhart, by James M. Moss, and T. C. Moss, and another, against Central Electric Power Cooperative for injunction. The six suits were tried in Common Pleas Court, Orangeburg and Calhoun Counties, E. H. Henderson and James M. Brailsford, Jr., JJ. Demurrers to the complaints were sustained, and plaintiffs appealed. The Supreme Court held that allegation that no public necessity existed for construction of proposed power line by public power project, and that, hence, power project was not authorized to take plaintiffs' land through eminent domain proceedings for purpose of erecting transmission system thereon failed to state cause of action for injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order of Judge Henderson follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a demurrer by the defendant to the plaintiff's complaint on the ground that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, in that it appears upon the face of the complaint that the defendant, as a cooperative nonprofit membership corporation organized under and for the purpose stated in the Rural Electric Cooperative Act, Code 1942, &sect; 8555-91 et seq., has the right under that act to obtain the right-of-way sought&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  over the plaintiff's lands by condemnation, upon the payment to plaintiff of just compensation for the taking thereof as ascertained in the condemnation proceeding, and the facts alleged in the complaint do not in law entitle the plaintiff to have the defendant enjoined from exercising its said right by means of the procedure prescribed in the statutes of South Carolina in such case made and provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was heard by me on September 28, 1951.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no contention by the plaintiff that the proposed power line is to be located in an improper place on this land, or that it is unnecessarily wide, or other objection of a local nature, but, as is accurately stated by counsel for the plaintiff in their excellent written brief, the allegations of the complaint raise the following question: &quot;Under the law of South Carolina when a corporation attempts to exercise the power of eminent domain, can a landowner challenge the right of the corporation to exercise that power on the ground that no public necessity exists for the construction of the project?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In considering a complaint for the purpose of passing upon a demurrer, while of course the facts which are well pleaded are deemed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be true, the demurrer does admit conclusions of law.  Spigner v. Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company, 148 S.C. 249, 146 S.E. 8; Henderson v. McMaster, 104 S.C. 268, 88 S.E. 645.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the matters involved in the complaint have already been passed upon by the Supreme Court in the appeal in the case of Bookhart against this defendant.  219 S.C. 414, 65 S.E.2d 781.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is clear that a landowner has a right to go to the court of equity for relief if a condemnor attempts to make an unreasonably hurtful location of the power line on his property such as by going through shade trees surrounding the residence, when that could be avoided.  Seabrook v. Carolina Power and Light Company, 159 S.C. 1, 156 S.E. 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also the Court will prevent the taking of an unnecessarily wide right-of-way.  White v. Johnson, 148 S.C. 488, 146 S.E. 411.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in my opinion, the question of the public necessity of constructing the project as a whole is a legislative or political one, and not subject to review by the Courts, in the absence of fraud, bad faith, or clear abuse of discretion on the part of the condemnor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 29 C. J. S., Eminent Domain, &sect; 89, page 882, we find the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The legislature may delegate the power of determining the necessity of exercising the power of eminent domain to public officers or boards or to private corporations vested with the power of eminent domain, and in the absence of any statutory provision submitting the matter to a court or jury the decision of the question of necessity lies with the body of individuals to whom the state has delegated the authority to take. Generally, a determination by the grantee of the power is conclusive and is not subject to judicial review, in the absence of fraud, bad faith, or clear abuse of discretion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also see 18 A. J. 734, and Lewis on Eminent domain, Vol. 2, sec. 597.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This defendant has been given authority by the General Assembly to condemn rights-of-way. Code, &sect; 8555-93. See also South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co. v. South Carolina Public Service Authority, 215 S.C. 193, 54 S.E.2d 777.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judging from the foot-notes, and the many additional cases in the pocket part, the principle laid down in 29 C. J. S., Eminent Domain, &sect; 89, page 882, seems to be the almost universal rule and I do not think that the South Carolina cases are to the contrary. These cases deal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with the question of the location of the right-of-way as it crosses the plaintiff's land, and not with the public necessity or expediency of the project as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Riley v. Charleston Union Station Company, 71 S.C. 457, 51 S.E. 485, the Court did not question the necessity for the building of a railway station in Charleston, but the point considered was its location, whether on the land of the plaintiff or on lands of other persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Hutchison v. York County, 86 S.C. 396, 68 S.E. 577, was a case where there was already a highway connecting the same communities. The plaintiff contended that the old route was adequate. There was involved a question of location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Sanders v. Luther, 164 S.C. 105, 162 S.E. 70, also had to do with the re-location of an existing road, this one in Beaufort County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation by the State of this great power of eminent domain does not mean that a condemnor is given a free rein, to run rough shod over the lands of the citizens of the State. The Courts will always jealously safeguard the right of landowners against a wrongful method in laying out the right-of-way across their particular tracts of land, but when it comes to the wisdom, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or expediency, or reasonable public necessity of the entire project, the department of government through which the State speaks is its legislature, and if such power has been delegated, the condemnor must act in good faith and not in a capricious or wantonly injurious manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an example, if the General Assembly should authorize a railroad company to construct a line of railway from Charleston to Columbia and should delegate to it the right of eminent domain for that purpose, I do not think that the judicial department of the State government could step in and hold up its hand and say that the entire project is unwise and not reasonably necessary in the public interest. The General Assembly determines the public necessity of the undertaking as a whole; the Court protects the citizen from bad faith or fraud on the part of the condemnor to whom the State has delegated this far-reaching power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many conclusions of law set forth in the complaint, and also many conclusions of inferences of fact. It should be noted that paragraphs 9 and 10 are in the alternative. Paragraph 9 alleges that the defendant has never made a finding of fact as to the necessity for the proposed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  power line. Paragraph 10 says, &quot;If the defendant has ever made any determination that any necessity exists,&quot; it is false and fraudulent. Under the principle governing alternative allegations, this does not amount to an allegation that no such finding was made.  Daniels v. Berry, 148 S.C. 446, 466, 146 S.E. 420; 41 A. J. 317, section 41; 71 C. J. S., Pleading, &sect; 41, page 109.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to paragraph 10, the allegation that the finding of necessity has no basis in fact is merely a conclusion. Such conclusions are not admitted by a demurrer.  Oliveros v. Henderson, 116 S.C. 77, 106 S.E. 855; McLeod v. Southern Railway Company, 188 S.C. 14, 198 S.E. 425; Duncan v. McCormick County, 192 S.C. 216, 6 S.E.2d 265.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is the plaintiff's conclusion that the finding by the defendant was false and fraudulent admitted by the demurrer. It is essential that the facts and circumstances which constitute fraud should be set out clearly.  State v. Jaques, 65 S.C. 178, 43 S.E. 515; Drennan v. Brown, 112 S.C. 340, 100 S.E. 75; Steele v. Kirven, 120 S.C. 88, 110 S.E. 837.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegation that the finding constitutes an abuse of discretion is merely a conclusion or inference of fact by the pleader. No&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  facts are set forth in this paragraph to substantiate the statement. As shown by the case of South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co. v. South Carolina Public Service Authirity, above, the facts which are alleged in other paragraphs of the complaint, especially paragraphs 6, 7 and 8, as to the building of the power line into Elloree, do not as a matter of law constitute an abuse of discretion.  Bank of Fort Mill v. Rollins, 217 S.C. 464, 61 S.E.2d 41; 71 C. J. S., Pleading, &sect; 261, page 525.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to the allegation that the determination of necessity was made for the personal benefit of the defendant, no facts are alleged in paragraph 10. If we turn to paragraphs 6, 7 and 8, and other paragraphs of the complaint, the facts there alleged indicate no personal benefit to the defendant, or that it is doing other than to carry out the purposes for which it was organized, and its contract duties, as set forth in the South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co. case, above. This, then, is a mere conclusion or inference, and not based on alleged facts; and so is not admitted by the demurrer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It Is Accordingly ordered that the demurrer of the defendant to the plaintiff's complaint be and the same hereby&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is sustained, and the complaint is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order of Judge Brailsford follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs, who are the owners of certain farm and timber lands, seek in this action to obtain an injunction restraining the defendant, a corporation organized under the Rural Electric Cooperative Act, Sections 8555-91 et seq., of the Code of Laws of 1942, from condemning a right-of-way over such lands for the construction of an electric transmission line, in a condemnation proceeding which it has commenced for that purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint alleges that the proposed transmission line is a high voltage trunk line designed for the purpose of conducting electric power in wholesale quantities to the area, section and community in and around the town of Elloree where the line will terminate; that this area, section and community is now, and has been for some time, adequately served and supplied with electric power sufficient to meet all present needs and all needs which may arise in the foreseeable future; that the proposed line will not supply electric energy to any of the defendant's members, governmental agencies, political subdivisions, or other persons who do not have an adequate supply&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of electric energy available to meet all present and future needs, and will not give as good service as existing facilities; and that no necessity exists for the construction of said line and for the condemnation of plaintiff's land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint also alleges that the defendant has entered into contracts with South Carolina Public Service Authority which preclude the defendant from selling power in the area, section and community to anyone other than Tri-County Electric Cooperative, Inc.; that the use of the line over and above service to such cooperative will be controlled by the said Authority; and that the defendant is attempting to condemn the right-of-way for a private use, in that the public generally will have no definite and fixed use of the line independently of the will of the defendant and the Authority, since the Authority has full discretionary power in fixing its rates and choosing its customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant filed a demurrer to the complaint, on the ground that the same fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in that it appears upon the face of the complaint that the defendant, organized under and for the purposes and with the powers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and functions set forth in the Rural Electric Cooperative Act, has the right under that Act to obtain by the exercise of its power of eminent domain the right-of-way sought over the lands of the plaintiffs upon the payment to the plaintiffs of just compensation for the taking thereof as ascertained in the condemnation proceeding referred to in the complaint, and that the facts alleged in the complaint do not entitle the plaintiffs to an injunction preventing the exercise of such power in the condemnation procedure prescribed in the Statutes in such case made and provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter has been fully argued before me by counsel for the parties; and, in my opinion, the demurrer should be sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs do not challenge the necessity for a right-of-way over their lands if the transmission line is to be built. Their contention is that, because of the existence of other electrical service available in the Elloree area, there is no necessity for the construction by the defendant of its transmission line thereto, and hence that public necessity for the exercise of its power of eminent domain for such construction is lacking. The question thus raised is a legislative or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  political one, which is not subject to determination or review by the courts in the absence of fraud, bad faith or clear abuse of discretion on the part of the condemnor. 29 C. J. S., Eminent Domain, &sect; 89, page 882; 18 Am. Jur. 734; Lewis, Law of Eminent Domain, section 597.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 29 C. J. S., Eminent Domain, &sect; 89, page 882, the applicable principle is thus stated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The legislature may delegate the power of determining the necessity of exercising the power of eminent domain to public officers or boards or to private corporations vested with the power of eminent domain, and in the absence of any statutory provision submitting the matter to a court or jury the decision of the question * * * lies with the body of individuals to whom the state has delegated the authority to take. Generally, a determination by the grantee of the power is conclusive and is not subject to judicial review, in the absence of fraud, bad faith, or clear abuse of discretion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint contains allegations that &quot;the defendant is falsely pretending that a public necessity exists for the construction of its proposed power line,&quot; and that &quot;no facts exist which create a public necessity for the construction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of defendant's proposed power line and the false pretence by the defendant that such necessity does in fact exist is made for the purpose of affording the defendant a colorable right to exercise the power of eminent domain, is an effort on the part of the defendant to fraudulently deprive plaintiffs of their property, is an effort to acquire plaintiffs' property for its personal benefit as distinguished from any public benefit arising out of any existing necessity to satisfy the needs of the public for electric power in the area to be served by the said line, constitutes an abuse of the discretion confided in the defendant by applicable statutes, and constitutes a taking of the plaintiffs' property without due process of law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These allegations are conclusions of law or fact, not admitted by a demurrer, and at most merely characterize the facts set forth in the complaint, which, however, must in themselves show fraud, bad faith, or clear abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a cooperative, nonprofit, membership corporation, organized under the Rural Electric Cooperative Act, the defendant has the corporate purpose &quot;of supplying electric energy and promoting and extending the use thereof&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in rural areas&quot;, Section 8555-92, and has the power under the Act to construct, maintain and operate electric transmission lines, and to exercise the power of eminent domain to obtain rights-of-way therefor, Section 8555-93 (k, l).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rural area&quot; is defined as &quot;any area not included within the boundaries of any incorporated or unincorporated city, town, village, or borough having a population in excess of twenty-five hundred (2,500) persons&quot;. Section 8555-121 (a).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act does not limit the authorized activities of the defendant to rural areas not having existing electric service; it indicated a contrary intention by providing that cooperatives organized under it shall be exempt in all respects from the jurisdiction and control of the Public Service Commission. Section 8555-118.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint does not allege that the area into which the transmission line is to be constructed is not a rural area, as so defined; or that the defendant can carry out its corporate purpose of promoting and extending the use of electric energy in such area without constructing the line; or that the electric service presently available in the area is rendered under a franchise which is exclusive&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as against the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant having the legal right to enter the area to engage in the performance of the purpose for which it was organized, the question whether it should do so in view of the existing electric service with which it will necessarily have to compete was for its determination, and the facts alleged in the complaint are insufficient to authorize or support a finding of fraud, or bad faith, or clear abuse of discretion on its part in making such determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegation that the condemnation of the right-of-way is for a private use because of the defendant's contracts with the South Carolina Public Service Authority is clearly untenable. It is settled that the defendant's corporate purpose is a public one, and that the exercise of its power of eminent domain to obtain a right-of-way for its transmission line is for a public use.  Bookhart v. Central Electric Power Cooperative, Inc., 219 S.C. 414, 65 S.E.2d 781. The Act gives the defendant broad authorization to contract in reference to its transmission system, Section 8555-93 (h), and the Authority has the power to contract with the defendant for use of such system to deliver the electric energy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  produced by it to its customers, license to do which it has in the act creating it, &quot;the highest kind of certificate of public convenience and necessity.&quot; South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co. v. South Carolina Public Service Authority, 215 S.C. 193, 54 S.E.2d 777, 783. Furthermore, it is not alleged in the complaint that more land is required to be taken by the defendant because of its contractual arrangements with the Authority, and the use of its line by the latter. Compare McMeekin v. Central Carolina Power Co., 80 S.C. 512, 518, 61 S.E. 1020, 128 Am. St. Rep. 885.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the defendant's demurrer to the complaint herein be, and the same hereby is, sustained, and the complaint is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

(1942), from doing so. The trial courts sustained the corporation's demurrers, which asserted that the complaints failed to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action where the corporation had authority under the Act to obtain rights-of-way by its power of eminent domain. On appeal, the court affirmed, adopting two trial court orders, and overruled the landowners' exceptions. The court held that the circuit decrees properly disposed of the issues presented where the corporation had the legal right under the act to enter the landowners' property to engage in the performance of the purpose for which it was organized, the facts alleged in the complaints were insufficient to authorize a finding of fraud, bad faith, or clear abuse of discretion, and the question of public necessity was a legislative or political one.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Common Pleas, G.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowners sought review of the decision of the Court of Common Pleas (South Carolina), which sustained respondent Myrtle Beach Board of Adjustment's exceptions to a special referee's recommendation that was favorable to the landowners' variance request. The landowners alleged unlawful discrimination in the Board's refusal to grant the landowners a variance to permit the location of a restaurant in a residential zone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners' motor court was included in an R-4 commercial zone that permitted motor courts. Their vacant lots across the highway were zoned R-1, the most restricted residential zoning classification, which did not permit the landowners to construct a public restaurant or dining room there. The landowners contended that enforcement of the zoning ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship to the landowners and that it amounted to an unconstitutional deprivation of property. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that it could not question the wisdom of the zoning ordinance or the location of the zoning district line that resulted in the vacant lots being included in the restricted residential area. Zoning was within the municipality's legislative discretion, and the court reviewed variance denials for an abuse of discretion. The landowners failed to establish that the refusal of their application for a variance constituted unlawful discrimination. The fact that their vacant lots were zoned for residential purposes even though they were located across the highway from a commercial zone did not establish that they had been discriminated against.</SPAN></P>

Brown against Eugene L. Moseley for a determination that defendant has no right to hold office as sheriff of Kershaw County beyond 1952 and that an election for such office should be held in that year. The Supreme Court, Stukes, J., held that the amendatory statute, providing for the election of the sheriff of such county in the general elections of 1954 and every four years thereafter, is not unconstitutional as a special law concerning a matter to which a general law can be made applicable nor as violating the constitutional provision that an act shall relate to but one subject expressed in its title.</SPAN></P>

The validity of Act No. 729 approved February 21, 1952, which specified when elections for sheriff of Kershaw County were to take place, was at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A sheriff was elected to a second four-year term and died during it, and defendant sheriff was appointed for the rest of the term, which ended in 1954 counting four years from the incumbent's reelection. Section 3473 of the Code of 1942 said that there was to be an election for sheriff held in each county except certain specified counties every four years starting with 1904. Ergo, an election in 1954 would not have been in conformity with that statute. However, that statute was amended by Act No. 729 approved February 21, 1952 to say that Kershaw County was to have an election for sheriff in 1954 and every four years thereafter. The court rejected the argument that the amended statute could not be applied. Subsection IX of &sect; 34 of Art. III of the South Carolina Constitution of 1895 prohibited a special law where a general law could be applied. The court wrote that a special provision in the general law was the logical remedy as Kershaw County had been off the statutory schedule for sheriff elections for years, and the amended part was not more special than the excepting of several counties from the general schedule in earlier statutes and in the part not amended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was an action brought by the Township Commissioners of the Township of Folly Island brought against defendants to test the validity of the corporate existence of the Township of Folly Island and the Town of Folly Beach. The Common Pleas Court, Charleston County (South Carolina) entered order in favor of the Township and certain defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The South Carolina legislature had established the Township of Folly Island by Act June 1, 1936, 39 St. at L. 1694 (South Carolina). The Township covered the entire island. The residents of the island then voted to incorporate as the Town of Folly Beach pursuant to 45 St. at L. 1821 (South Carolina). That statute provided that towns of less than 1,000 inhabitants could not have a radius of more than one mile. An amended in 1950, Act May 6, 1950, 46 St. at L. 2169 (South Carolina), removed the one mile radius limitation as to islands, because many barrier islands, including Folly Island, were more than one mile long but very narrow. The trial court upheld the validity of the amendment and the court affirmed, thereby affirming the validity of the Town. However, the trial court had held that the two governments could not co-exist because they covered the same area and would result in an inevitable conflict. The court disagreed and reversed on this issue. The existence of a township did not preclude the incorporation of a town. Where a town was formed, its government prevailed within its boundaries, at least to the extent that there was any conflict between the two entities.</SPAN></P>

Three municipal corporations were located within area prescribed by act, but third did not share in income and management of authority as did first two. The Common Pleas Court, Newberry County, Steve C. Griffith, J., sustained validity of act except as to third municipality, and plaintiff appealed. The Supreme Court, Oxner, J., held that, under statutory provision requiring that all municipal corporations in same class have same powers and restrictions, statute was invalid as to third municipality, but such fact did not render entire act invalid.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff contended that the act was unconstitutional. The trial court sustained the constitutional and statutory validity of the act except as to a third municipality that did not share in the income and management of the authority. Plaintiff sought review. Although the act was invalid as to the third municipality because ch. 187 of the 1942 Code (South Carolina) granted all municipal corporations the right to operate a municipal gas system, the court held that this fact did not render the entire act invalid. Moreover, there was no appeal from that portion of the order with reference to the third municipality.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that it was an error to place him on general probation and subject to general probation conditions where he had been clearly placed on special probation. The sentence was not corrected, and defendant's probation was revoked. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the municipal violations, which were numerous, were sufficient evidence of facts tending to establish the violation of general probation conditions, and there was no evidence that the circuit court abused its discretion in so holding.

Heyward and another brought an action against J. Gary Black, Auditor of Beaufort County, and others for declaratory judgment and an injunction against defendants' carrying out the duties imposed upon them by the Act providing for such annexation, and, by consent of the parties, both cases were referred to E. W. Mullins, of the Columbia Bar, as Special Referee, who filed a report upholding the legality of the annexation. The Common Pleas Court, Jasper and Beaufort Counties, J. Henry Johnson, J., entered decrees confirming the report of the Special Referee, and contestants appealed. The Supreme Court, Per Curiam, held inter alia, that sufficient land would remain to Beaufort County after the annexation to meet the constitutional requirement that each county have at least 500 square miles of area, and that the Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Report of E. W. MULLINS, Special Referee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Presiding Judges of the Court of Common Pleas for Beaufort and Jasper Counties, South Carolina:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the undersigned Referee, have to report:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two actions entitled as above were instituted in due time to determine the validity of an Act of the General Assembly, approved by the Governor on the 2nd day of June, 1950, annexing Yemassee Township, then in Beaufort County, to Jasper County. These cases, although pending in separate counties and differing as to the relief sought, raise the same basic issues by their challenge of the legality of the proposed annexation of Yemassee Township, in Beaufort County, to Jasper County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By order of Honorable J. Henry Johnson both actions were referred to the undersigned Referee with instructions to take the testimony and report his findings of fact and conclusions of law, the order further providing that the two actions should be tried together. This has been done and this report is the Referee's report in both of these cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony was taken at Beaufort and the arguments were had before the Referee in Columbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cases were ably argued by counsel on both sides, who also filed helpful briefs, and the Referee has given careful consideration to all of the contentions of the respective parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both actions the validity&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Act of the General Assembly of May 31, 1950, approved June 2, 1950, 46 Stats. 2332, providing for the transfer and annexation of Yemassee Township, in Beaufort County, to Jasper County, is questioned on various grounds which will be hereinafter considered and discussed. It might be well to first quote the pertinent portions of the Act. The preamble (emphasis added) is as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas, upon a certificate of the commissioners of election for Beaufort County filed in his office, the Secretary of State has duly certified to the General Assembly that at an election duly ordered and held in accordance with the provisions of the constitution and laws of the State of South Carolina on the question of whether or not that portion of Beaufort County lying West of New River and run of Great Swamp, known as and constituting Yemassee Township, shall be annexed to Jasper County, more than two-thirds of the votes cast in the said election were in favor of such annexation of said Yemassee Township to Jasper County; and,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And whereas, the validity of the said election is now questioned; and whereas, upon the record before it the Genneral Assembly finds that the said election was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lawfully held and resulted in the required vote for the said annexation but, in order to protect any possible rights the opponents of the said annexation may have the General Assembly desires to preserve for the opponents of the said annexation an opportunity to apply to the Courts for such relief as they may be entitled to in the manner hereinafter set out; and Whereas, if the said election is valid and if the word 'area', in the sense in which it is used in the Constitution in Article 7, section 4, includes marsh lands and inland water, or either, as the same are defined and explained in the surveyors' report herein which is the meaning attributed to that word by the General Assembly in this act, then all of the conditions required by the Constitution and laws of this state were and have been complied with;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 13 of the Act (emphasis added), is as follows: &quot;This act shall be deemed a public act and take effect thirty days after the approval thereof by the Governor, unless within the said thirty days appropriate proceedings shall have been instituted in a Court of competent jurisdiction and if such proceedings are so instituted the act shall not take effect until a final&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  decision is rendered in such proceedings so instituted, holding first, that the word 'area' in the sense in which it is used in the Constitution in Article 7, Section 4, includes marsh lands and inland water, or either, as the same are defined and explained in the surveyors' report herein; and, second, deciding in the favor of the validity of the said election; or unless the said proceedings are dismissed without a decision on either of the said two questions and for other cause; in either of which two events this act shall thereupon immediately take effect; provided that this act shall never take effect should the final decision in said proceedings hold that said word 'area' in the sense in which it is so used does not include marsh lands or inland water or should it decide against the validity of the said election and the Court or Courts may hear and determine any and all legal or constitutional questions affecting said annexation or election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act makes its effective date depend upon, first, the institution of certain proceedings, and next upon final decision in such proceedings and the two questions set out in the Act to be decided in such proceedings are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the correctness of the Legislative finding upon the record before it (including the adjudication of the Commissioners of Election and the Certificate of the Secretary of State) that the election is valid, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, the correctness of the Legislative finding that the word &quot;area&quot;, in its constitutional sense, includes marsh lands and inland water, or either, and its finding upon the record before it (including stipulation No. 3 and the accompanying highway map) that the requisite area has been left in Beaufort County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to these questions, the Court may also decide any other legal questions properly before it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its jurisdiction comes from the Constitution and not this Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before considering the various objections raised as as to the validity of the Act, it should be pointed out that most of the objections revolve around the contention that the effect of the annexation, if the Act is held valid, will be to reduce the &quot;area&quot; in Beaufort County below the 500 square miles required of all &quot;old counties&quot; by Article VII, section 4, of the Constitution of this State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both complaints it is alleged that the Act is illegal and unconstitutional for various&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reasons which will be hereinafter taken up and disposed of in detail. Since the objections go both to the constitutionality of the Act, and also depend upon the meaning and effect to be given to the language used therein, we shall first briefly advert to the rule which our Court has frequently announced with respect to the determination of the question as to whether or not an Act of the General Assembly is constitutional, and then to certain general rules which the Court has applied in determining the meaning and effect of legislative enactments generally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Gaud v. Walker et al., 214 S.C. 451, 53 S.E.2d 316, 320, the Supreme Court adverted to the following well settled principals which should govern the Court in determining whether or not an act of the General Assembly violates any of the provisions of the State Constitution: &quot;We approach the consideration of the various constitutional grounds upon which this legislation is challenged with the following well settled principles in mind: 'The supreme legislative power of the State is vested in the General Assembly; the provisions of our State Constitution are not a grant but a limitation of legislative power, so that the General&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Assembly may enact any law not expressly, or by clear implication, prohibited by the State or Federal Constitution; a statute will, if possible, be construed so as to render it valid; every presumption will be made in favor of the constitutionality of a legislative enactment; and a statute will be declared unconstitutional only when its invalidity appears so clearly as to leave no room for reasonable doubt that it violates some provision of the Constitution.' Moseley et al. v. Welch et al., 209 S.C. 19, 39 S.E.2d 133, 137.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primary rule of construction, as to which all other rules for statutory construction is subservient, is that one which requires that the legislative intent must prevail if it can reasonably be discovered in the language used, which must be construed in light of the intended purpose, and hence the real purpose and intent of the law-makers will prevail over the literal import of a statute.&nbsp;Greenville Enterprise v. Jennings, 210 S.C. 163, 41 S.E.2d 868; Caughman v. Columbia Y. M. C. A., 212 S.C. 337, 47 S.E.2d 788.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In construing a statute a court may not give to particular words a significance which would be clearly repugnant to the statute looked at&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as a whole and destructive of its obvious intent. Creech v. South Carolina Public Service Authority, 200 S.C. 127, 20 S.E.2d 645.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another familiar rule is that, as between two possible constructions of a statute, that one should be adopted which effectuates rather than defeats the legislative purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As heretofore pointed out the objections raised with respect to the invalidity of the Act are identical in both complaints. (See subdivisions a to j, both inclusive, of paragraph 6, in the case of Beaufort County v. Jasper County, and subdivision a to j, both inclusive, of paragraph 7 of the complaint in the other case).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs allege that the Act in question is invalid and unconstitutional for a number of reasons, and we will consider the questions raised in the order set forth in the complaints (subdivisions a to j, inclusive).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision (A)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This objection is as follows: &quot;Because the surveyors' report upon which the Commissioners based their finding that Beaufort County will be left after the annexation with more than 500 square miles of area, was made without an actual survey and through the use of inaccurate and unreliable hearsay information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  law does not require the surveyors to make any actual survey of the area left in Beaufort County; and there is no evidence in the case from which it might be reasonably concluded that the surveyors used inaccurate or unreliable hearsay information in determining the area left in Beaufort County. Section 3030 of the Code provides that the surveyors shall settle the question of area. This they must do in view of the facts and the law. In settling the question of area the surveyors exercise a quasi judicial power. In this case the surveyors found a sufficient area, including marsh land. I therefore find and conclude that the surveyors followed the statutory procedure and therefore this objection must be overruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision (B)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This objection is as follows: &quot;Because neither the surveyors nor the Commissioners in their purported determination of the area which would remain in Beaufort County after the proposed annexation took into consideration the fact that numerous legislative enactments (e. g. XXV Statutes 636 (1907)); XXXIV Statutes 96 (1925); XXXVI Statutes 722 (1929); XLII Statutes 192 (1941) ceded sizable areas of Beaufort County to the Federal Government and that even&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  more extensive areas of Beaufort County, the extent of which is not accurately known to the plaintiff's County officers but could have been ascertained by the surveyors, have been acquired by the Federal Government from the area of Beaufort County by methods other than cession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no proof in the case that the surveyors and Commissioners did not take into consideration land ceded to the Federal Government; lands otherwise acquired by the Federal Government would not reduce the area of Beaufort County. The evidence on behalf of the plaintiff (testimony, page 4) shows that the area of United States Government lands in Beaufort County, exclusive of inland waters, is approximately 18 square miles. This, subtracted from the high lands plus marsh land, (exclusive of inland waters), leaves far more than the required 500 square miles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision (C)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This objection is as follows: &quot;Because the exclusion of land now owned and occupied by the Federal Government within the boundaries of Beaufort County would reduce the area of Beaufort County, after the annexation of Yemassee Township to Jasper County, below the limits required by Article VII, Section 4, of the Constitution. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs contend that the exclusion of land now owned and occupied by the Federal Government would reduce the area remaining in Beaufort County to less than 500 square miles. Lands merely owned and occupied would not reduce that area within the meaning of the constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ownership and use for public purposes by the United States of lands within a state, without more, do not withdraw the lands from the jurisdiction of the state.&quot; Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook, 281 U.S. 647, 50 S. Ct. 455, 74 L. Ed. 1091.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 2042 of the Code provides: &quot;In respect to the places within the boundaries ceded by the State to the United States, the jurisdiction of this State is concurrent with that of the United States, according to the terms of cession in each case respectively.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision (D)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This objection is as follows: &quot;Because the Governor, upon the even division of the Commissioners as to whether Article VII, Section 4, of the Constitution had been violated, arbitrarily ordered the election without a factual or legal determination of the questions at issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Governor's order directing the holding of the election contains a specific factual finding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by him that sufficient area would remain in Beaufort County. For the purpose of ordering the election it is the Governor's prerogative to determine this question of area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In State ex rel. Weeks v. Board of Registration, 87 S.C. 474, 70 S.E. 898, 905, the Court said: &quot;The Constitution, &sect; 1, art. 7, imposes exclusively upon the Governor the duty of determining whether there has been a compliance with the requirements of the Constitution preparatory to the ordering of an election, and the courts have not the wish or power to interfere with him in the exercise of executive prerogative or discretion. Lamar v. Croft, 73 S.C. [407] 412, 53 S.E. 540.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Parler v. Fogle, 78 S.C. 570, 59 S.E. 707, 708, the plaintiff sought to enjoin an election on a new county upon the ground that the boundaries were not described with sufficient definiteness, and were not surveyed and plainly marked as required by statute, and because the lines had been run in disregard of townships and polling precincts, and further because the Governor allowed the petition presented to him to be amended. As to these matters, the Court said: &quot;There is nothing in the Constitution, or statutes of the state requiring&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the lines of new counties to conform to township or precinct boundaries. The question whether the boundaries of the proposed new county were laid down in the petition with sufficient definiteness was for the governor to determine. Lamar v. Croft, 73 S.C. 407, 53 S.E. 540; State ex rel. Resse v. Ansel, Governor [78 S.C. 331], 58 S.E. 933. So also it was within the discretion of the Governor to refuse or allow the amendment to the petition before him setting forth with more definiteness the boundaries. The Constitution proceeds on the theory that the Governor, with respect to all proceedings before him, will see that its provisions are carried out with justice to all parties concerned; and to this end by implication he was empowered to pass upon all questions of detail, such as proposed amendments, reasonably necessary to the determination of the main question whether the election should be ordered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision (E)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This objection is as follows: &quot;Because the election held on January 24, 1950 was illegal and of no effect in that persons were permitted to vote who had not fulfilled the requirements of Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution, and Section 2267 of the Code by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  residing within the State for two years, within the County for one year, and within the voting precinct for four months; and in that persons were permitted to vote who had not legally registered themselves as electors pursuant to Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution, and Section 2272 of the Code, by applying in person for registration. That if only persons had been permitted to vote who were legally qualified to vote, the result of the election would have been in opposition to the proposed annexation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the opinion of the Referee the alleged irregularities in the election about which the plaintiffs complain cannot now be raised and determined in these actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case of Segars v. Parrott, 54 S.C. 1, 31 S.E. 677, 865, establishes the rule that the validity of an annexation election is determined by the election commissioners and the report of these commissioners is final unless properly appealed from. See also Parler v. Fogle, 78 S.C. 570, 59 S.E. 707; Abernathy v. Wolfe, 117 S.C. 545, 109 S.E. 275.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs in their brief recognize the rule established by these decisions, but contend that it has no application since they contend that the legislative intent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as disclosed by the terms of the Act was to permit the contestant to contest the election upon any ground as to its illegality or irregularity. I do not so construe the Act. The Act says, &quot;upon the record before it the General Assembly finds that the said election was lawfully held and resulted in the required vote for the said annexation but, in order to protect any possible rights the opponents of the said annexation may have the General Assembly desires to preserve for the opponents of the said annexation an opportunity to apply to the Courts for such relief as they may be entitled to in the manner hereinafter set out; * * *.&quot; (Emphasis added).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems to me the evident intent of the Legislature was merely to postpone the effective date of the Act to permit the contestants to apply to the Court for any possible rights they might have to contest the election, and the Legislature did not intend by this act to renew or give validity to any rights which contestants may have had but which they had lost by failure to follow the proper legal procedure. In other words, I do not believe the Act intended changing the rule of law announced in the Segars case, that the decision of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Commissioners is final unless reviewed in the manner provided by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, assuming that the Act authorizes the contestants to raise the objections set out in Subdivision (E), supra, I find that the plaintiffs have not made out a sufficient case to justify the setting aside of the election on any of the specified grounds. The plaintiffs offered considerable testimony as to alleged irregularities in this election which was taken subject to defendants' objection. Even if this testimony should be admitted in evidence it is not sufficient to change the result of the election. Furthermore, I hold that this evidence is not admissible. Fraser v. James, 65 S.C. 78, 43 S.E. 292.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision (F)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This objection is as follows: &quot;Because, even on the erroneous calculations of the surveyors as to the area remaining in Beaufort County after the proposed annexation, 500 square miles of area will not remain in Beaufort County since neither land between high water mark and low water mark, nor so-called inland waters, can be considered in computing the area of Beaufort County under the Constitutional requirements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is immaterial whether or not lands between high and low water&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  marks and inland waters constitute area. I find from the evidence that there is sufficient high ground and marsh land to leave more than 500 square miles in Beaufort County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision (G)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This objection is as follows: &quot;Because the Act of May 31, 1950, providing for the annexation makes findings as to compliance with the Constitutional requirements which are not supported by the record before the General Assembly, and are at variance with the true facts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This subdivision is in very general terms. The plaintiffs have failed to produce any evidence to justify a conclusion that the legislative findings as to compliance with the constitutional requirements are not supported by the record before the General Assembly, or that such findings are at variance with the true facts. Furthermore, the Legislature itself is charged with the duty of determining whether the constitutional requirements in respect to annexation or the creation of a new county have been complied with, and thus its determination of those facts cannot be assailed by evidence aliunde the record. Fraser v. James, 65 S.C. 78, 43 S.E. 292.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision (H)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This objection is as follows: &quot;Because the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Act of May 31, 1950 providing for the annexation unconstitutionally leaves the determination of whether the Constitutional requirements have been complied with to the Court in derogation of Section 3035 of the Code which requires the General Assembly itself to determine whether the Constitutional requirements have been complied with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act does not leave to the Courts the determination whether the constitutional requirements have been complied with. The General Assembly in the preamble to the Act has expressly made that determination itself, and has merely provided that the Act shall not go into effect should the Court in any action brought pursuant to the permission granted by the Act, set aside the election as irregular or hold that the General Assembly was wrong in the meaning which it ascribed to the word &quot;area&quot; in the Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that the Legislature saw fit to make the Act effective only on the happening of a certain contingency does not affect the validity of the Act. The applicable rule is stated in 11 Am. Jur., p. 926, &sect; 216, as follows: &quot;The rule is well settled that while the Legislature may not delegate its power to make a law, it may make a law to become&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  operative on the happening of a certain contingency or future event. Moreover, in general it makes no essential difference what is the nature of the contingency if it is essentially just and legal. The reason for this rule is that it is not always essential that a legislative act must in any event take effect as law after it leaves the hands of the Legislature. If the law is in its provisions a complete statute in other respects, its taking effect may be made conditional upon some subsequent event. When that event happens, the statute takes effect and becomes the law by force of legislative action as fully as if the time when it should take effect had been unconditionally fixed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision (I)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This objection is as follows: &quot;Because the final passage in the South Carolina Senate of the Act of May 31, 1950 was accomplished through an improper and illegal suspension of the rules of the Senate and the setting of an arbitrary time for a vote upon the Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This objection is without merit. Where an act has been duly signed by the presiding officers of the General Assembly and approved by the Governor and duly enrolled in the office of the Secretary of State evidence outside&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Act itself offered to show that the Act was not passed in compliance with law is incompetent to impeach the act. State v. Moorer, 152 S.C. 455, 150 S.E. 269. An act which has been enrolled and signed by the presiding officers of the Senate and House of Representatives is conclusively presumed by the Court to have been properly passed. State v. Lewis, 181 S.C. 10, 186 S.E. 625.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivision (J)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This objection is as follows: &quot;Because the General Assembly, in passing the Act of May 31, 1950 providing for the annexation, has expressly directed that Article VII, Section 4 of the Constitution be violated by ordering the annexation if only 493.5 square miles (the area of high ground and inland water as found by the surveyors) remain in Beaufort County, although Article VII, Section 4 of the Constitution requires that at least 500 square miles remain in the County.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In as much as the record shows that high ground and inland water would not leave the required area in Beaufort County, the defendants have conceded that the portion of the Act providing for the annexation, if marsh lands be not included in the area, is invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the preamble the General Assembly has specifically&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  found: &quot;* * * and if the word 'area' * * * includes marsh lands and inland water, or either * * * which is the meaning attributed to that word by the General Assembly in this act * * * then all of the conditions required by the Constitution and laws of this state were and have been complied with&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the record shows that high ground plus marsh land leaves more than the required area in Beaufort County. It is therefore manifest that the constitutional requirement as to area is complied with even if inland water be eliminated entirely. The record before the General Assembly shows the square miles of area in all three categories so that as a matter of pure mathematics the invalid portion of the Act is separable from the valid portion; the two portions of the Act are not dependent upon each other as conditions or considerations for each other so as to warrant the belief that the General Assembly would not have passed the residue independently of the part that is void; and on the contrary the General Assembly has specially found in the second section of the preamble: &quot;And whereas, * * * if the word 'area' * * * includes marsh land and inland water, or either * * * which is the meaning&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  attributed to that word by the General Assembly in this act, then all of the conditions required by the Constitution and laws of this state were and have been complied with&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From all of which it is clearly manifest that the Legislature would have passed this Act entirely independently of inland water and actually did so and furthermore, expressed its intent of so doing by the use of the words just quoted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Townsend v. Richland County, 190 S.C. 270, 2 S.E.2d 777, 781, the Supreme Court says: &quot;The rule is that where a part of a statute is unconstitutional, if such part is so connected with the other parts as that they mutually depend upon each other as conditions, and considerations for each other, so as to warrant the belief that the Legislature intended them as a whole, and if they cannot be carried into effect, the legislature would not have passed the residue independently of that which is void, the whole act is void. On the other hand, where a part of the statute is unconstitutional, and that which remains is complete in itself, capable of being executed, wholly independent of that which is rejected, and is of such a character as that it may fairly be presumed that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Legislature would have passed it independent of that which is in conflict with the Constitution, then the courts will reject that which is void and enforce the remainder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Area</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having dealt with the specific objections to the Act as set forth in the complaint there is left for consideration the question of what the word &quot;area&quot; includes in the sense in which it is used in the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence offered as to area, aliunde the record before the General Assembly is inadmissible. Fraser v. James, 65 S.C. 78, 43 S.E. 292.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony of Mr. Black, County Auditor for Beaufort County, shows that territory in Beaufort County belonging to the United States consists of 18 square miles of high ground. It is therefore apparent that the high ground plus marsh land, less such United States area, leaves far more than 500 square miles, inland water excluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fact Findings Of Area</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law apparently provides three different fact findings of area: First, the surveyors; second, the Governor, and third, the Legislature. Here all three have concurred and I see no reason why they should not be permitted to concur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Is Area</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am of opinion that area&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***25]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  certainly includes high ground and marsh land, and the record shows that the high land and marsh land in Beaufort County exceeds the 500 square miles after the 18 square miles of United States territory are deducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article VII, Section 4, of the Constitution provides: &quot;No old County shall be reduced to less area than five hundred square miles, to less assessed taxable property than two million dollars, nor to a smaller population than fifteen thousand inhabitants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This provision of the Constitution that two million dollars of assessed taxable property be left in the old county indicates that the makers of the Constitution in using the word &quot;area&quot; had no intention of dividing the area of the county into high land and marsh land or high land and inland water or valuable land or worthless or non-taxable land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The framers of the Constitution certainly knew the difference between high land and marsh land. If they had intended that 500 square miles of high land should be left in the old county they would have used the words &quot;high land&quot; instead of the word &quot;area&quot;. Area has been defined as:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The surface contents of any figure.&quot; Webster's Dictionary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The amount&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***26]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of surface included within a boundary line or enclosing a solid figure; superficial extent; as, the area of a triangle; the area of tillage was four acres.&quot; Funk &amp; Wagnall's New Standard Dictionary. (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am of the opinion, and so hold, that the soil under water between high and low water mark constitutes land. See State v. Pacific Guano Co., 22 S.C. 50 (decided in 1884) and decree of Circuit Court Judge Maher in State v. Oak Point Mines, reported by order of the Supreme Court, in the Appendix to Volume 22 of South Carolina Reports. It therefore follows that marsh land and inland water likewise constitute land, the subject of state and private ownership. Here, again, the framers of the Constitution of 1895 must have contemplated that any kind of land within the boundaries of the county would be covered by the term &quot;area&quot;, as used in the constitutional provision in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I conclude as a matter of law that the word &quot;area&quot; in the sense in which it is used in the Constitution in Article VII, Section 4, includes both marsh lands and inland waters, as the same are defined and explained in the surveyors' report herein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also find, for the reasons heretofore&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***27]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stated, that the election referred to in the said Act was valid and not subject to attack in these proceedings for any of the reasons set forth in the complaint herein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I further find that the Act providing for the transfer and annexation of Yemassee Township of Beaufort County to Jasper County is not unconstitutional or invalid by reason of any of the objections urged by the plaintiffs in either of the two cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is accordingly recommended that the Act in question be declared valid and that the complaint in each of the two suits be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that sufficient land would remain in the complaining county after the annexation to meet the requirement of Article 7, &sect; 4 of the Constitution that each county have at least 500 square miles of area. The court also held that it was unnecessary to determine whether inland waters could be considered a portion of the complaining county's area within the contemplation of the constitution because it was manifest that the constitutional requirement as to area was complied with even if inland water was eliminated entirely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c1"><SPAN CLASS="c4">December 3, 1951, Decided </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Action by G. T. Floyd and others against O. Frank Thornton, as Secretary of State of South Carolina, and others to compel the Secretary of State to issue a bank charter, to have a section of the code regulating banks declared unconstitutional and void, and to have acts of the Board of Bank Control, on petitioners' application for a bank charter, declared arbitrary and beyond their power and authority, wherein a rule was issued requiring respondents to show cause why they should not make discovery of their acts and doings, together with all documents and papers relating to the organization of the bank and the Board's conditional approval of the application, or why a writ of certiorari should not be granted. The Common Pleas Court, Richland County, L. D. Lide, J., determined that the code provision regulating banks was constitutional and valid and refused prayer for discovery, but ordered issuance of writ of certiorari, directing respondents to certify to court records relating to application for bank charter, and petitioners appealed. The Supreme Court, Henderson, A. A. J., held that the trial judge properly determined the constitutional issue in ruling upon the application for a writ&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exceptions overruled; order affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order of Judge Lide, in part, requested to be reported follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition alleges that Code Section 7829-2 is unconstitutional, and the prayer of the petition in the outset seeks judgment that the same be declared null and void because in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution, and Article I, Sections 5, 14 and 15, and Article III, Section 1, and Article V, Section 6, of our State Constitution. The constitutional objections relate primarily to the &quot;equal rights&quot; and &quot;due process&quot; clauses, referring also to the separation of the departments of the government and matters of that general character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the petitioners make no reference to Code Section 7829 in their prayer for relief, there are several allegations throughout the petition which may reasonably be construed to question its constitutional validity with regard to the provision therein contained relating to the appointment of the members of the Board of Bank Control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In view of the fact that the petitioners have sought the approval of the Board of Bank Control, and have thus availed themselves of the rights and privileges&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  accorded by the sections under attack, it might follow that they should be estopped to raise any constitutional objection. 11 Am. Jur. 767-770.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assuming, however, that the determination of this question upon the bare allegations of the pleadings might be of doubtful propriety, it is my judgment that the constitutional questions should be considered on this hearing, especially because if Code Section 7829-2 is unconstitutional and therefore null and void, the previous proceedings thereunder are wholly ineffectual. This section is set forth in full as follows for convenience of reference:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No bank or building and loan association hereafter incorporated shall be granted a charter by the secretary of state, unless and until the board has approved such application in writing; or shall any branch bank be established without the approval in writing by the board. Before any such application for the incorporation of a bank or building and loan association, or the establishment of a branch bank shall be approved, the board shall make an investigation to determine whether or not the applicants have complied with all the provisions of law and whether in the discretion of the board, they&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are qualified to operate such institution and whether the establishment of such bank or building and loan association or of such branch bank would serve the public interest, taking into consideration local circumstances and conditions at the place where such bank or building and loan association or branch bank, proposes to do business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I have already stated, this section is a part of the general banking law enacted in 1936. And it may be observed that the petitioners recognize the right of the General Assembly to regulate the conduct of banking institutions in order to protect the depositors therein; but apparently they would limit governmental control to that extent. Indeed, they allege that they have an inherent right and privilege to engage in the banking business. But the banking business &quot;is of a pre-eminently public nature, and is therefore universally recognized as a proper subject of legislative regulation under the police power of the state.&quot; 7 Am. Jur. 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, our own State Constitution in Section 9 of Article IX made proper provision with reference to banks in the following language: &quot;The General Assembly shall have no power to grant any special charter&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for banking purposes, but corporations or associations may be formed for such purposes, under general laws, with such privileges, powers and limitations, not inconsistent with this Constitution, as it may deem proper. The General Assembly shall provide by law for the thorough examination and inspection of all banking and fiscal corporations of this State.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, it seems quite apparent that the regulation of the conduct of business by banking institutions without any regulation or control of their establishment might prove wholly ineffective, which I believe is a statement strongly confirmed by the history of banking, and I am unable to find anything in the provisions of the Code Section now under consideration depriving the petitioners or anyone else in like situation of any of their constitutional rights or privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This particular section of the banking law does not seem to have ever come before our Supreme Court. But it is of interest to observe that certain other parts of the same banking law have been before the Court and have been approved. In the case of Zimmerman v. State Board of Bank Control, 194 S.C. 518, 8 S.E.2d 359, there was involved the liquidation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of an insolvent bank under the supervision of the State Board of Bank Control, and the constitutional right of the Board to supervise such liquidation was approved and confirmed. And it was held in the case of Ex parte Miller, 191 S.C. 260, 1 S.E.2d 512, relating to a building and loan association, that the State Board of Bank Control is a special administrative body of limited jurisdiction; but I think it may be properly added, of important jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are fortunate to have before us a leading opinion delivered by the illustrious Mr. Justice Holmes in the case of Noble State Bank v. Haskell, 219 U.S. 104, 31 S. Ct. 186, 187, 55 L. Ed. 112, decided January 3, 1911, wherein it was held (quoting from the syllabus): &quot;The police power of a state extends to the regulation of the banking business, and even to its prohibition except on such conditions as the state may prescribe.&quot; And the syllabus is correctly based upon the following excerpt from the opinion of the Court: &quot;We cannot say that the public interests to which we have adverted, and others, are not sufficient to warrant the state in taking the whole business of banking under its control. On the contrary, we are of opinion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that it may go on from regulation to prohibition except upon such conditions as it may prescribe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This wise and farseeing decision was rendered long before 1933 when tragic financial conditions culminated in the historic bank holiday, resulting in the restoration of confidence, because the banking institutions of the country were placed upon a firm foundation by reason of legislative action providing, among other things, for the control of the banking business in its inception as well as its subsequent operation. Consequently some of the banks were not allowed to reopen. See also Pue v. Hood, Commissioner of Banks, 222 N.C. 310, 22 S.E.2d 896.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My conclusion therefore is that all constitutional objections raised to Code Section 7829-2 should be, and they are hereby, overruled, and this section is hereby declared to be constitutional and effective in all respects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The objections raised by the petitioners to the constitutionality of Code Section 7829 relate to the matter of the appointment of members of the State Board of Bank Control. This section provides that the Board shall be composed of five members, one of whom shall be the State Treasurer, as an ex-officio member, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  who shall be Chairman. It is also provided that the remaining four members &quot;shall be appointed by the Governor, two of whom shall be engaged in commercial banking and recommended by the state bankers' association, one shall be engaged in building and loan association business and recommended by the said associations and one shall be in the cash depositories business and recommended by the representatives of the cash depositories affiliated with the state bankers' association.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general rule of law in connection with this matter is stated as follows in 42 Am. Jur. 953: &quot;Where the legislature creates an office, it may, when not restricted by the Constitution, confer the power of appointment thereto upon public officers or boards, as, for example, upon a judicial officer or upon associations, corporations, or persons. This does not constitute an illegal delegation of legislative powers, since the power of appointment to office is not legislative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of Ashmore v. Greater Greenville Sewer District, 211 S.C. 77, 44 S.E.2d 88, 96, 173 A. L. R. 397, the Court had before it an act providing that in the selection of the Board of Trustees of the defendant Sewer District&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  there should be certain members thereof, respectively representing and chosen by certain social service organizations, such as Rotary, Kiwanis, and the like, the American Legion Post, and other local bodies; and the Court held that in this respect the act was an invalid delegation of legislative power. But it should be observed that in the careful and discriminating unanimous opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Stukes this holding was limited as follows: &quot;The rule which we approve goes no further than to invalidate attempted delegation by the legislature of the appointive or elective power to unofficial persons or bodies where the latter are without rational and substantial relation to the law to be administered by the appointees or electees, or, we add, to the public institution to be governed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are unable to conceive of a case where there is a more rational and substantial relation to the law to be administered by the appointees than that involved in the statute before us. In other words, the State Bankers' Association is obviously an organization especially qualified for the selection of men to be appointed on the Board of Bank Control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am therefore of opinion that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  constitutional objections raised by the petitioners to Code Section 7829 should be, and they are hereby, overruled; and this section is declared to be constitutional and effective in all respects.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner organizers sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas for Richland County (South Carolina), which ruled that &sect; 7829-2 of the Code (South Carolina) was constitutional and valid in all respects. The judge refused the prayer for a discovery, but ordered the issuance of a writ of certiorari in an action involving respondents, Secretary of State and associated individuals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An application to the Secretary of State for a bank charter was refused, for the reason that the Board of Bank Control had not given its unconditional approval. The organizers claimed that &sect; 7829-2 of the Code of 1942 was unconstitutional and void. It was alleged that the circuit judge was in error in passing upon the constitutionality of &sect; 7829-2 when that question was not then before him for determination. The organizers contended that the Board of Bank Control had no legal authority to impose certain conditions. The court found that ordinarily the constitutionality of an act should not have been determined on an application for a discovery or for the issuance of a writ of certiorari. However, the circuit judge did not pass upon the constitutionality of &sect; 7829-2 without notice to the organizers, or without giving them a hearing, and only did so with their apparent approval. Thus, the court found that the order of the Circuit Court correctly decided the constitutional questions.</SPAN></P>

Myers was charged by indictment pending in the Court of General Sessions for Kershaw County with crime of murder. The General Sessions Court, Kershaw County, G. Duncan Bellinger, J., granted state's motion for order committing defendant to state hospital for insane for period of 30 days for examination as to his sanity, and defendant appealed. The Supreme Court, Oxner, J., held that when insanity is interposed as defense, compulsory examination of accused by experts for purpose of determining his mental condition and testifying in regard thereto does not violate either constitutional privilege of accused of not being compelled to be witness against himself or constitutional guarantee of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the order of commitment did not violate defendant's right against self-incrimination under Article 1, &sect; 17 of the Constitution, nor did it constitute a denial of the constitutional guaranty of due process of law. The court noted that defendant was only being required to submit himself to observation by the medical experts in order that they might pass upon his mental condition. The court held that the guaranty against self-incrimination had no application to physical evidentiary circumstances that may be revealed by an open exhibition of defendant's body.

The Supreme Court, Stukes, J., held that, where county instituted action against probate judge and his surety for an accounting on basis of $ 4.00 marriage license fee, and thereafter a person who was required by probate judge to pay $ 4.00 marriage license fee instituted action against county and probate judge and county treasurer for recovery of $ 3.00 on the ground that the proper fee was only $ 1.00, any possibility of future adjudication in the second case that the statute fixing $ 4.00 fee is unconstitutional would not affect the outcome in the instant action and the judge and his surety would be bound by the statute in the instant action.</SPAN></P>

On remand, the probate judge and his surety procured a stay upon the ground that a separate action's results would determine the law's constitutionality. On appeal, the court held that a law's actual existence, prior to a determination of unconstitutionality, was an operative fact and might have consequences which could not justly be ignored. The court held that the past could not always be erased by a judicial declaration and that the effect of a subsequent ruling as to invalidity had to be considered in various aspects, with respect to particular relations, individual and corporate, and particular conduct, private and official. In reversing, the court held that the probate judge and his surety could not procure another litigant to question the law's validity.

The court examined the requirements of Code &sect; 7232-1, Acts 1946, Page 1376 and found that the time limitations prescribed for filing a contest or suit applied to annexation petitions and not just to the validity of the election proper. The court held that &sect; 7232-1 applied to the whole annexation process, and it was not unreasonable or arbitrary. After examining the time limitations fixed by the 1946 Act, the court held that they were not unreasonable or arbitrary because it was reasonable that the issues were to decided without undue delay.

The Act also provided for a general retail sales tax from which the bonds authorized by the Act were to be paid. The court dismissed relator's petition and held that the Act was constitutional.

The Common Pleas Court, Orangeburg County, James M. Brailsford, Jr., J., dissolved temporary injunction and denied injunction pendente lite, and plaintiff appealed. The Supreme Court, Per Curiam, held that rural electric power cooperative for distribution of electricity was public service corporation even though its consumers were members of cooperative and that legislative intent by creation of such cooperative and investing it with power of eminent domain and to distribute, sell, supply, and dispose of electric energy in rural areas was to make the cooperative a public service corporation</SPAN></P>

The landowner argued that the electric cooperative's exercise of eminent domain was unconstitutional because the property to be condemned was to be used for the benefit of the cooperative's members and not the public at large. The trial court dissolved a temporary injunction and denied injunction pendente lite. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court and found that the proposed condemnation was for a public purpose because the electric cooperative existed for a public purpose. As evidenced by the legislative act allowing for its creation, the electric cooperative's purpose was to extend the benefits of electric power into areas not served by conventional utility companies. This in itself was a public purpose and it was irrelevant that only the only the members of the cooperative would benefit directly. Nor was it relevant that the electric cooperative was not subject to the authority of the public service commission because the cooperative was still subject to regulation by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  William De Treville, and others, brought an action against Emmette Groover, Mayor, and W. J. Stubbs, and others, Councilmen of the Town of Forest Acres, to enjoin enforcement of town ordinance prohibiting the buying of water unless bought from town or public works commission, for use in town, and prohibiting the selling of water unless water was bought from town or public works commission. The County Court, Richland County, Legare Bates, J., issued an injunction pendente lite and the town appealed. The Supreme Court, Oxner, J., held, inter alia, that a prima facie showing was made that ordinance arbitrarily and unreasonably interfered with plaintiff's rights to use and enjoyment of plaintiff's property so as to justify issuance of injunction pendente lite.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town asserted on appeal that there was no basis for injunctive relief, that the claimed invalidity of the ordinance could be interposed as a complete defense to any prosecution based thereon, and that the residents had an adequate remedy at law. The court found that the showing made by the residents as to the unreasonableness of the ordinance was alone sufficient to warrant the trial court in issuing an injunction pendente lite. The court further found that there had been a prima facie showing that the ordinance in controversy arbitrarily and unreasonably interfered with the residents' rights to the use and enjoyment of their property and that the challenged ordinance would be unreasonable and oppressive as to the plaintiffs or any other residents and property owners to whom the town was unable to supply water. The court held that the residents' showing was sufficient to warrant injunctive relief until there could be an inquiry into the merits of the controversy. The court further held that the showing on the issue of estoppel was also sufficient to justify injunctive relief until the case could be determined on its merits.</SPAN></P>

Nesbitt, suing for himself and all other taxpayers of Gaffney School District No. 10 of Cherokee County, South Carolina, brought an action against Arthur Gettys, and others, as trustees of Gaffney High School District No. 11, attacking the validity of the Act creating Gaffney High School District No. 11 and providing that Gaffney School District No. 11 should assume title to the present high school buildings, equipment and grounds previously operated in Gaffney District No. 10. The Common Pleas Court, Cherokee County, Bruce Little John, J., rendered a judgment adverse to the defendants and the defendants appealed.

The taxpayers objected to the new district assuming title to the school buildings, equipment and grounds formerly owned by district no. 10, and contended that the act was unconstitutional as it deprived taxpayers of property without due process and in violation of equal protection. The trial court granted judgment in favor of the taxpayer and the school district trustees appealed. The court reversed and held that upon consolidation, the new district was properly authorized to take all of the property of the former district and also became liable for the debts of all. The ownership of the property was a trust for educational purposes. It was not something to be bartered or sold to personally profit or reimburse the taxpayers. It will be no less devoted to its public trust purpose after the consolidation than before and no less benefit to the taxpayers of district no. 10.

The Common Pleas Court, Richland County, T. B. Greneker, J., denied the petition and affirmed the Board's order and petitioner appealed. The Supreme Court, Per Curiam, held that evidence sustained finding of the State Board of Education that petitioner used fraudulent aid and assistance when she took teacher examinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decree affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following is the opinion of Judge Greneker, in the Court below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The above-entitled matter came before me to be heard on the petition of the above-named petitioner, asking for a Writ of Certiorari and Supersedeas, and praying that the action of the South Carolina State Board of Education revoking her certificate to teach in the public schools of South Carolina be reversed, and that she be restored to her former status and permitted to continue to teach in the public schools of South Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hearing on this petition was held before me in Columbia on November 21st and 22nd, at which time the facts and circumstances out of which this matter&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arose were gone into and developed in detail, and the evidence was carefully considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel for both parties agreed that I should consider this matter on its merits, and the record and exhibits prayed for in the 10th paragraph of the petition, as well as some additional exhibits, were all introduced in evidence for my consideration at the hearing, and have been carefully considered by me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the facts upon which this proceeding is based are rather lengthy and involved, its importance to the State of South Carolina, and also the number of individuals that may be affected, seem to require that they should be set out in some detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the teacher certification program in South Carolina, yearly teacher examinations, designated National Teacher Examinations, are held at various places in this State. The last such examination was held on February 19th, 1949. The questions contained in these examination are compiled, edited and published by an organization known as the Educational Testing Service, whose principal office is in Princeton, New Jersey, and the evidence discloses that no one in South Carolina has any part in the preparation of these examination questions. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some time prior to February 19th, 1949, these examination questions, contained in three booklets, with separate sheets upon which the answers to these questions were to be recorded, special pencils known as &quot;electrographic&quot; pencils, and certain score cards and possibly other material, were shipped from Princeton, New Jersey, to Dr. McColl, of the School of Education of the University of South Carolina, who is the administrator in charge of managing the details of conducting this National Teacher Examination in South Carolina. This examination material was packaged to conform to the predetermined number of those who were to take the examination in each room where it was to be given, and all the material was in sealed packages. Dr. McColl kept this material in its original sealed-package state in a store room at the University of South Carolina, in Columbia, until Wednesday and Thursday before the examination, which was given on Saturday, when he called in the local administrative heads of the examination, designated &quot;local examiners&quot;, to get the examination material to be used at their respective local centers. These local examiners were furnished room lists, showing the names and numbers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the individuals who had registered to take the examination who were assigned to particular rooms at the places where these local examiners were to conduct the examination, and these examiners thereupon broke the seals of the packages, checked the examination material against these room lists and, upon verifying the fact that they each had the correct and proper material, replaced it in the packages and resealed them. Each local examiner then took his material and kept it until Saturday morning, February 19th, when it was taken to the local examination centers, and distributed to those taking the examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just prior to the examination, a rumor or report was circulated that there might be efforts made to use unlawful or fraudulent aid by some of those taking the examination, with the result that those in charge of conducting the examination were warned to be alert to discover any such improper attempts. In each room where the examination was held, there was a designated &quot;room examiner&quot; in charge of such room, with one monitor or proctor for each thirty examinees, or fractional part of thirty, in the room, to assist the room examiner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In conducting the examination, question&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  booklet number I was first distributed, with its corresponding answer sheet; after the lapse of a prescribed period of time, booklet number I and answer sheet number I were collected and question booklet number II and answer sheet number II were distributed; then, after the lapse of the designated time, booklets number II and answer sheets number II were collected and booklets number III and answer sheets number III were distributed; and finally, when the allotted time for the entire examination had expired, booklets number III and answer sheets number III were collected. The question booklets were then checked, enclosed in sealed packages, and shipped by express direct from each examination center in this State to the offices of the Educational Testing Service, in Princeton, New Jersey, and the answer sheets, containing the examinee's answers to the questions contained in the examination, were enclosed in sealed envelopes, and sent by first class mail to the same organization in Princeton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These answer sheets, which the average layman would normally refer to as examination papers, were scored or graded by the Educational Testing Service, in Princeton, and no one in South Carolina&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had any part in grading them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Teacher Examination is composed of questions, slightly more than six hundred, which are described as &quot;multiple choice&quot; questions. Each question has a number of suggested answers, generally five, from which the examinee chooses and marks the one which, in his opinion, is correct. There is but one correct answer to each question, leaving, in most subdivisions of the examination, four incorrect answers to each. The answer sheets issued to the examinees, corresponding to the question booklets, had the number of choices of answers to each question indicated for each question, and the examinees indicated their choices with the electrographic pencils distributed to them. These pencils were so described because of the fact that their leads contained a high content of electricity-conducting material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the answer sheets, or examination papers, of those taking the examination in South Carolina were received by the Educational Testing Service, in Princeton, New Jersey, from the individual examination centers in South Carolina, they were then graded or scored by said Educational Testing Service in accordance with its general procedure. These&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  examination papers are graded or scored by machines, and the evidence discloses that the manner of grading these papers is by constructing a master correct stencil, or answer sheet, in which the correct answer to each question is punched, or perforated, and then the answer sheets or examination papers of those taking the examination were compared with this master correct answer sheet, or stencil, by electrical impulses. Where the examinee answered the question correctly, by choosing the correct answer, the machine would indicate a correct answer, and where the examinee gave an incorrect answer, the machine, by electrical impulse, would also show that the examinee had answered a question incorrectly. These machines make no calculations whatsoever for omissions, and these omissions are not considered in computing the scores which the examinees made upon the examination. It appears that what these educational testing experts term &quot;raw scores&quot;, which are the bases for arriving at the grades made by the examinees on the subdivisions of the examination, are computed by taking the number of correct answers and subtracting from that number the number of incorrect answers divided by the number&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of ways in which each question could have been answered incorrectly. After these raw scores, which represent the total number of correct answers less a fractional part of the incorrect answers, have been computed, they are then reduced to what are designated &quot;scale scores&quot;, and these scale scores are the marks, or grades, which are reported to have been made by the examinees upon the examination. The evidence shows that each examinee's examination paper is run through not less than two or three scoring machines, to be certain that the examination papers are graded, or scored, correctly, If the two machines coincide identically, then it is assumed that that particular paper has been graded correctly. If there is any discrepancy between the grades indicated by the two machines, then the papers are run through a third machine and then sometimes the final grading is done by an individual employee of the Educational Testing Service comparing this particular examinee's examination paper with the correct master answer sheet. After the examination papers from South Carolina were graded, or scored, by the Educational Testing Service, in Princeton, the grades made by the respective teachers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were reported to the teachers in South Carolina who took this examination directly from the Educational Testing Service, and copies of these grades were sent to the South Carolina Department of Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the National Teacher Examination was conducted in South Carolina, on February 19th, 1949, the room examiners, monitors and proctors had been warned to be particularly alert to detect any one's attempting to use illicit or fraudulent aid or assistance while taking the examination, in view of the rumors that attempts to use such aid and assistance would be made which had circulated prior to the examination, hereinabove mentioned. While the examination was in progress, room examiners and proctors perceived several of those taking the examination using, or attempting to use, such aid and assistance, and these room examiners and proctors confiscated the material that these examinees were using, or attempting to use, for their aid and assistance in answering the questions contained in the examination. In all, some seven different instruments, containing, or purporting to contain, the answers to a considerable number of the questions contained in this National Teacher Examination&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were confiscated from individuals who were taking the examination. These instruments, generally referred to as &quot;fraudulent keys&quot;, were confiscated from various places in this State. Some of these documents, or fraudulent keys, were rather complete instruments, and covered most of the sections contained in the examination, while other of these fraudulent keys contained two or three sections of the examination only. These fraudulent keys were delivered to Dr. McColl, of the University of South Carolina, the following day; and, upon examining them, Dr. McColl perceived, according to his testimony, that they were answers, or purported answers, to certain of the questions contained in the examination. He then, individually, made copies of each of these seven instruments, or fraudulent keys, and mailed them to the Educational Testing Service, in Princeton. The Educational Testing Service took these seven instruments, and, upon examining them, determined that they were actually fraudulent aids, or keys to parts of the examination. One significant feature of these instruments is that, where the content was similar with reference to subdivisions of the examination covered, the information contained&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under those subdivisions was practically identical. In other words, if two of these instruments purported to answer the same sections of the examination, the information contained under those sections was almost identically similar; the variation between these various instruments being so small as to be practically negligible, and such as might easily have resulted from a mistake or mistakes in transcribing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having determined that these seven instruments were fraudulent aids, or keys for assistance of those taking the National Teacher Examination, in 1949, the Educational Testing Service, at the request of the South Carolina Board of Education compared the examination papers of every teacher who took the examination in South Carolina with the fraudulent key. The Educational Testing Service took the seven fraudulent keys, and from their content prepared what was designated as a composite or master fraudulent key. This master fraudulent key represents the content of the seven fraudulent instruments confiscated from those taking the National Teacher Examination in South Carolina, and was prepared by copying the subject-matter of the seven fraudulent keys so confiscated. In those&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rare instances where there was a variation between the various seven fraudulent keys, the Educational Testing Service took that purported answer which was contained in the majority of the fraudulent keys. The seven fraudulent keys covered, in whole or in part, every section contained in the National Teacher Examination with one exception; the one portion not covered by the fraudulent key being that subdivision designated Verbal Comprehension, Part I.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having prepared this master or composite fraudulent key, the Educational Testing Service then cut a stencil, to be used in its scoring or grading machines, for the purpose of comparing this master fraudulent key with all examination papers from teachers in South Carolina who took the examination in 1949. This stencil was cut to show the answers contained in the fraudulent key regardless of whether they were correct or incorrect. When the examination papers from South Carolina were run through these scoring or grading machines, the comparison with this master fraudulent key would indicate the extent, if any, to which these examination papers corresponded to this key. In all there were some four thousand eight hundred papers from South&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Carolina compared with this fraudulent master key, and this comparison indicated that somewhat more than six hundred of the papers from South Carolina corresponded to this master fraudulent key to such extent as to indicate that there was more than accidental or coincidental correspondence. Every examination paper from South Carolina, whether the examinees were white or colored, was compared with this master fraudulent key. It is self-evident that these grading or scoring machines would have no idea of the identity of the examinee whose paper was being compared with the master fraudulent key.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After having compared all papers from South Carolina with this master fraudulent key, the Educational Testing Service then deemed it advisable to compare examination papers from other States, and particular stress was given to papers from examination centers around Augusta, Georgia, Charlotte, North Carolina, and examination centers from States like Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, Alabama, and other States in the general vicinity of South Carolina. Also, inasmuch as the principal offices of the Educational Testing Service are in Princeton, New Jersey, it was deemed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  advisable to compare sizable numbers of papers from New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania with this master fraudulent key. In addition, samples were taken from practically every State in the United States and compared with this master fraudulent key.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of all of these comparisons, the Educational Testing Service ascertained that only in South Carolina were there examination papers that corresponded in any degree of any consequence to this master fraudulent key, and that there were only somewhat more than six hundred papers in South Carolina that did correspond to this master fraudulent key to a marked degree. Upon taking the names of those whose papers corresponded to such marked degree to this master fraudulent key, it was ascertained that all of them were Negroes who had taken the National Teacher Examination at various examination centers in South Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In preparing this list of those whose examination papers corresponded to such marked degree to the master fraudulent key as to clearly indicate that those examinees must have used a fraudulent key in preparing their answers, the Educational Testing Service gave the examinees the benefit of doubt and the evidence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shows that, in those instances where the similarity was not so great as to preclude doubt, the Educational Testing Service dismissed that examinee from suspicion of having used the fraudulent key.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When this matter was heard before me, there was presented in evidence the complete record of the hearing of Julia Pettiford upon a Rule to Show Cause as to why her certificate should not be revoked, a certified copy of her answer sheet or examination paper, a certified copy of the master fraudulent key, a certified copy of the correct master key, showing the correct answers to each question contained in the examination, and the seven fraudulent instruments, or keys, which were confiscated from individuals taking the examination while in the act of using, or attempting to use, such instruments or keys. An inspection of this master fraudulent key revealed that it is by no means complete. There were ten large subdivisions of the National Teacher Examination; and, as above stated, there is no key at all for Part I of Verbal Comprehension. In other sections, the fraudulent key does not purport to answer every question, but omits varying numbers in the various sections. Also, the answers contained&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the fraudulent key are not always correct and, in a number of sections, there are almost as many incorrect answers as there are correct answers The section entitled Child Development and Educational Psychology had sixteen questions answered correctly, fifteen questions answered incorrectly, and fourteen questions omitted. No questions were covered by the fraudulent key after question 36. The section entitled History, Literature and Fine Arts contained ninety questions, but the fraudulent key purported to answer forty of those questions only, answering twenty-three of them correctly and seventeen incorrectly. The manner in which this fraudulent key answered incorrectly, omitted and stopped furnished a rather definite pattern to which the examination papers from South Carolina could be compared. Particularly significant were the incorrect answers set out in the fraudulent key; for, in all but one or two sections, there are four incorrect answers to each question contained in the examination, and it is difficult to conceive just how or why an examinee choosing the incorrect answer should choose that one of the four incorrect answers which was contained in the fraudulent key with any&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  substantial regularity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were a number of circumstances which indicated the use or nonuse of the fraudulent key, which may be summarized briefly, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) The correspondence of correct answers in an examinee's paper to the correct answers contained in the fraudulent key;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) The correspondence between incorrect answers in an examinee's paper to the incorrect answers in the fraudulent key, and particularly whether the incorrect answers corresponded in the same identical manner of answering incorrectly;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) The correspondence between omissions in an examinee's paper and the omissions in the fraudulent key;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) The correspondence between stopping points in the sections of an examinee's paper and stopping points in corresponding sections of the fraudulent key; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) Scores made by an examinee on those sections where there was a marked and substantial degree of correspondence to the fraudulent key and scores made on those sections where there was no correspondence of any consequence to the fraudulent key.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having determined, in the opinion of its officers and employees, that there were somewhat more than six hundred examinees in South Carolina&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  whose examination papers corresponded to such extent to the fraudulent key as to indicate the use of a similar instrument by such examinees when taking the examination, the Educational Testing Service advised the South Carolina State Board of Education and Department of Education of the names of those on this list, with the result that numerous proceedings, similar to the one now before me, were instituted in this State. The powers of the State Board of Education, insofar as they are pertiment to this proceeding, are concerned and are as follows: &quot;The State Board of Education shall have power: * * * (4) to grant state teachers' certificates and to revoke them for immoral or unprofessional conduct, profanity or evident unfitness for teaching&quot;. From this, the State Board of Education has power to grant teachers' certificates, and to revoke them, under the statute, for cause: those causes being immoral or unprofessional conduct, profanity or evident unfitness for teaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 17th, 1949, the petitioner herein was served with a Rule to Show Cause, directing her to appear before the State Board of Education on August 24th, 1949, to show cause why her State Teachers' Certificate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  should not be revoked; the grounds for such proposed revocation being that she had been guilty of immoral or unprofessional conduct, or was evidently unfit for teaching by reason of the fact that she had secured certain information in the form of answers to questions contained in the National Teacher Examination, which examination she took in Columbia, South Carolina, on February 19th, 1949, and used such information for her aid and assistance in taking the examination, to cheat upon said examination, and to obtain a higher score or grade upon said examination than she herself was naturally capable of earning, by reason of her knowledge and intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to this Rule to Show Cause, the Petitioner herein appeared before the State Board of Education, on August 24th, 1949, at which time a hearing was held in connection with her alleged cheating upon the National Teacher Examination. The facts which I have stated hereinabove were developed from individual witnesses, and then a Mr. Crane, who is an employee of the Educational Testing Service, and engaged in educational testing work, was called as a witness to compare the examination paper, or answer sheet, of the petitioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  herein with the master fraudulent key. It might be well to state that, at this hearing, the petitioner herein was well and capably represented by counsel throughout the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In comparing the examination paper of this petitioner with the master fraudulent key, the following facts were established: In the section of the examination entitled Child Development and Educational Psychology, there were forty-five questions. The fraudulent key started with question one and concluded with question thirty-six; and, of these thirty-six questions covered by correct answers, incorrect answers and omissions, it had sixteen answered correctly, fifteen answered incorrectly, and five omissions. Of the sixteen correct answers in the fraudulent key, this petitioner had fifteen of those sixteen answered correctly; of the fifteen incorrect answers in the fraudulent key, this petitioner answered thirteen of those fifteen incorrectly, and incorrectly in the same identical manner, although she might have answered any one of those thirteen questions incorrectly in four different ways; and, of the five omitted between questions one and thirty-six, this petitioner omitted three of those five which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the fraudulent key omitted. Of the nine questions remaining in that section beyond where the fraudulent key ended, this petitioner attempted five of those nine, getting one correct and four incorrect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the section entitled Non-Verbal Reasoning, there were forty-eight questions in all. The fraudulent key covered the first thirty-two questions, of which it answered twenty-eight correctly, three incorrectly, and omitted one. There were sixteen questions beyond where it ended. Of the twenty-eight questions answered correctly in the fraudulent key, this petitioner had twenty-six of those twenty-eight correct, as did the fraudulent key; of the three answered incorrectly in the fraudulent key, this petitioner answered those same three incorrectly in the same identical manner, although she might have answered each of them incorrectly in four different ways; and, of the one omitted, this petitioner attempted it, answering it incorrectly. Of the sixteen questions remaining beyond where the fraudulent key stopped, this petitioner attempted three, getting one correct and missing two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that section of the examination entitled Current Affairs, there were ninety questions in all. The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fraudulent key purported to cover the first twenty-seven only of these questions, leaving sixty-three questions beyond where it ended. Of the first twenty-seven questions, the fraudulent key answered fifteen correctly, answered four incorrectly, and omitted eight. The petitioner herein answered the same fifteen that the fraudulent key had answered correctly in the same manner, correctly; of the four incorrect answers in the fraudulent key, petitioner answered three of those four incorrectly in the same manner, although there were four incorrect choices to each question; and, of the eight omissions in the fraudulent key between questions one and twenty-seven, petitioner omitted six of those eight and attempted to answer the other two, getting one correct and one incorrect. Of the sixty-three questions remaining beyond the point where the fraudulent key ended, this petitioner attempted eleven of those sixty-three, getting five correct and six incorrect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were two parts to Verbal Comprehension, designated as Part I and Part II. So far as the evidence discloses, there was no fraudulent key for Part I of Verbal Comprehension. In this section, there were forty questions. Of those&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  forty questions, petitioner attempted eleven, getting three correct and eight incorrect, and making what is termed a raw score of one on that section. However, there was a fraudulent key covering Verbal Comprehension, Part II, and this part contained thirty questions in all. The fraudulent key covered all thirty of the questions, by correct answers, incorrect answers and omission, having twenty-five answered correctly, four answered incorrectly, and one omitted. The petitioner answered sixteen correctly of the twenty-five answered correctly in the fraudulent key; answered incorrectly three of the four answered incorrectly in the fraudulent key in the same manner as they were answered incorrectly in the fraudulent key, although they might have been answered incorrectly in any one of four different manners, and omitted the other question answered incorrectly in the fraudulent key, and attempted the one question omitted in the fraudulent key, answering it incorrectly. Her raw score on this section was fourteen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the section entitled Guidance and Measurements in Education, there were forty-five questions in all. The fraudulent key stopped after question forty; and, between questions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  one and forty-one, it had twenty-six answered correctly, six answered incorrectly, and five omissions. Of the twenty-six answered correctly by the fraudulent key, petitioner had twenty-one of those twenty-six likewise correct; of the six answered incorrectly by the fraudulent key, the petitioner answered those same six questions incorrectly in the same identical manner as did the fraudulent key, although there were four incorrect choices to each of those six questions; and, of the eight omissions through the first forty questions, the petitioner omitted five of those eight that the fraudulent key omitted. There were five questions remaining beyond the point where the fraudulent key stopped, and the petitioner attempted one of those five, answering it incorrectly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The above represents, in substance, the evidence presented to the State Board of Education to establish the fact that this petitioner used fraudulent assistance in the form of an aid or key while answering the questions contained in the National Teacher Examination, which she took on February 19th, 1949, in Columbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioner denied, in express terms, that she used any outside aid or assistance of any nature&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***25]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  while taking the examination, and specifically denied the allegations contained in the Rule to Show Cause. She testified that the answers which she gave to the questions contained in the National Teacher Examination were the result of her own knowledge, and that she had no illegal or fraudulent aid or assistance while taking the examination. She further testified that, for a period of some four or five months prior to taking the examination, she studied practically every afternoon and every night to prepare herself better for this examination. The evidence indicates that she introduced before the two members of the Board of Education who took the testimony various books and periodicals which she had studied. Petitioner lives in Columbia, but teaches in a school at Prosperity, in Newberry County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In further support of petitioner's position that she did not use any unlawful aid or assistance while taking this examination, her husband testified that he had observed her studying practically every afternoon and every night for some four or five months prior to the date when this examination was held, in February, 1949. One Daniel Thompson, who works for a newspaper in Columbia, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***26]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has worked for this newspaper continuously since 1942, testified that the reputation of petitioner for truth, veracity and honesty, was excellent, and that he did not believe that she would be guilty of any unlawful or dishonest conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose and scope of writs of certiorari are clearly expressed by The Supreme Court of South Carolina in Feldman v. South Carolina Tax Commission, 203 S.C. 49, 26 S.E.2d 22, 24, where it states: &quot;A writ of certiorari cannot be made a substitute for an appeal or writ of error, as seems to have been done in this case. We have held in numerous cases that this Court on writ of certiorari will confine its review to the correction of errors of law only, and will not review the findings of fact of an inferior Court or body except when such findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence.  McKnight v. Smith, 182 S.C. 378, 189 S.E. 361; Young v. Sapp, 167 S.C. 364, 166 S.E. 354; Smith v. Saye, 130 S.C. 20, 125 S.E. 269; State ex rel. Davis v. State Board of Canvassers, 86 S.C. 451, 68 S.E. 676. Judges of the Courts of Common Pleas are bound by the same rule and limitation.  Charles v. Byrd, 29 S.C. 544, 8 S.E. 1; State ex rel. Sawyer v. Fort, 24 S.C. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***27]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  510&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same rule is likewise announced in Smoak v. Rhodes, 201 S.C. 237, 22 S.E.2d 685; Jennings v. McCown, 97 S.C. 484, 81 S.E. 963; and Rawl v. McCown, 97 S.C. 1, 81 S.E. 958.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A careful review of the evidence in this case indicates that there was ample, and more than ample, testimony to support the finding of the State Board of Education when it held that this petitioner had used fraudulent aid and assistance, similar to that contained in the keys or aids appropriated from those actually taking the examination, when she took this examination on February 19th, 1949. The comparison between her examination paper or answer sheets, and the fraudulent key shows such striking similarity that it is almost an inescapable conclusion that this petitioner necessarily used aid similar to that of the fraudulent key when she took this examination. While it may be stated, as an abstract proposition, that almost anything is possible, the possibility of the similarity between her examination paper and this fraudulent key being accidental or coincidental is so extremely remote as to be almost infinitesimal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consequently, I am convinced, and hereby hold, that there was ample evidence, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***28]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and much more than ample evidence, to support the finding of the State Board of Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such being the situation as regards the facts and evidence in this matter were any errors of law committed by the State Board of Education when hearing the matter of this petitioner under the Rule to Show Cause issued by it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner alleges numerous errors committed by the State Board of Education in conducting this proceeding, chief of which is the fact that but two members of the State Board of Education took the testimony; whereas, petitioner asserts that it was necessary that a quorum of the State Board of Education take the testimony at the hearing in the proceeding in which she was involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 5280 of the Code of 1942, which relates to the State Board of Education, among other things, provides as follows: &quot;A majority of the board shall constitute a quorum for transacting business&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record discloses that the State Board of Education appointed two of its members, who may be designated &quot;hearing members&quot;, to take the testimony at those hearings and to report such testimony to the full State Board of Education in meeting duly assembled, at which time the full&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***29]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State Board of Education received the report of the hearing members, considered the testimony taken by these hearing members, and then rendered its decision. The petitioner asserts that allowing but two members of the Board of Education to take the testimony constituted an unlawful delegation of power, with the result that the proceeding in which the testimony in the matter in which petitioner was involved was taken was illegal, null and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In determining whether there was or was not sufficient evidence to determine that this petitioner had used unlawful, fraudulent aid or assistance while taking the National Teacher Examination, it is clear that a quorum of the State Board of Education would have to pass upon this, since the determination of that question would clearly constitute transacting business, which requires the presence of a quorum of the Board of Education. The facts conclusively show, however, that two hearing members of the Board did not render decisions, but simply took the testimony and reported it to the full board. It is my opinion, and I hereby hold, that such action did not constitute an unlawful delegation of power by the State Board of Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***30]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is a good discussion of this particular question in 42 Am. Jur., Public Administrative Law, Paragraph 141, Pages 484 et seq., a portion of which is as follows: &quot;Due process of law does not require that the actual taking of testimony be before the same officers as are to determine the matter involved. A hearing is not inadequate or unlawful merely because the taking of testimony is delegated to less than the whole number, or even to a single member, of the administrative tribunal, or to an examiner, hearer, or investigator employed for this purpose, even though such procedure has not been expressly authorized by the legislature. The actual decision must remain with and be made by the body constituted by the legislature, but it may be made on the report of the examining officer or body. * * * Where a hearing is required as a prerequisite to action by an administrative officer, the one who decides must hear. This rule does not, however, preclude practicable administrative procedure in obtaining the aid of assistants in the department. Assistants may prosecute inquiries. Evidence may be taken by an examiner. Evidence thus taken may be sifted and analyzed by competent subordinates. But&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***31]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  there must be a hearing in a substantial sense, and to give the substance of a hearing, which is for the purpose of making determinations upon evidence, the officer who makes the determinations must consider and appraise the evidence which justifies them&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctrine is fully discussed and stated by Mr. Chief Justice Wolfe, of the Utah Supreme Court, concurring specially in the decision in Crow v. Industrial Commission of Utah, 104 Utah 333, 140 P.2d 321, 148 A. L. R. 316. In that case, but one member of the Utah Industrial Commission attended the hearing, which was held on June 19th, 1941. This attending commissioner ceased to act as a member of the commission on June 30th, 1941, and the commission rendered its decision on August 14th, 1941. When the Commission rendered its decision, the commissioner who had heard the testimony, and who had ceased to act as a commissioner in the interim, was not present, and the evidence established the fact that he not only did not participate in the decision, but he made no findings, either written or oral, which made his opinion of the evidence available to the commission in making its decision. On this ground the decision of the Industrial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***32]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Commission was reversed. In its majority opinion, however, the Court uses the following language, 149 A. L. R. 319: &quot;This does not necessarily require that all of the commissioners must be present at the hearing, or even that the one hearing the evidence must concur in the result, but his opinion on the testimony must be available to the commission in making its decision&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his special concurring opinion, Mr. Chief Justice Wolfe reviews the authorities on this question in some detail, Crow v. Industrial Comm., 104 Utah 333, 140 P.2d 326, 148 A. L. R., at pages 320-323, and, in summarizing the doctrine applicable, states it to be as follows: &quot;The upshot of the matter is that even where the Administrative Agency is performing functions in their nature judicial, as is the case in hearing compensation claims, the requirements of due process do not require that he who conducts the hearing must make or participate in the decision. It is not analogous to the situation where a judge dies or resigns after hearing the evidence but before registering his conclusions. There is usually continuity of personnel on Administrative Agencies even though there may be rotation in office. What is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***33]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  required to satisfy the demands of due process, that is, of a full or fair hearing, is that he who observes the witness and listens to the evidence must transmit his observations or conclusions to those others who, whether they are superiors or associate members of the same agency, are to decide and this may be done in the form of tentative findings or by a report or recommendations or orally in conference. And ordinarily where the examiner is still connected with the agency at the time it renders its decision it will be presumed that he has communicated his observations and conclusions to the body which employes him or of which he is a part but where he has, shortly after the hearing and before decision is handed down, severed his connection with the agency, I see no objection to requiring that the record show that the remaining or new members who are to make the decision have had the actual benefit of his impressions and conclusions, and especially is this desirable where, as in the instant case, the outcome depends on nondocumentary evidence which is in sharp conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As pointed out by Mr. Chief Justice Wolfe, there has been considerable misconception of the doctrine announced&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***34]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Morgan v. United States, 298 U.S. 468, 56 S. Ct. 906, 912, 80 L. Ed. 1288. The Morgan case does not hold, as it is sometimes cited as holding, that the administrative agency which renders a decision, in a quasi-judicial proceeding, must actually hear the evidence and see the witnesses. It does hold that the administrative agency which makes the findings must address itself to the evidence, and upon the evidence before it must conscientiously reach a conclusion which it deems such evidence to justify. In announcing this rule, however, the Supreme Court of the United States, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, says: &quot;This necessary rule does not preclude practicable administrative procedure in obtaining the aid of assistants in the department. Assistants may prosecute inquiries. Evidence may be taken by an examiner. Evidence thus taken may be sifted and analyzed by competent subordinates, Argument may be oral or written. The requirements are not technical. But there must be a hearing in a substantial sense. And to give the substance of a hearing, which is for the purpose of making determinations upon evidence, the officer who makes the determinations must consider and appraise&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***35]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the evidence which justifies them&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the matter now before me, the record shows that two members of the Board of Education actually took the testimony, which, as hereinabove set out, was fully developed, with petitioner's counsel cross examining witnesses as he saw fit. This testimony was not only presented to the full Board of Education when it met in regular meeting, but the record shows that a written summary of the evidence introduced against and in favor of the petitioner was presented to the full Board of Education when it met to consider the evidence and render its decision in the matter of petitioner herein. While the record in this particular matter does not so indicate, it was brought out at the hearing before me, as a matter of public record, that all nine members of the State Board of Education had attended a considerable number of these hearings, and this fact seems to be conceded by counsel for the petitioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence showing the comparison between the master fraudulent key and this petitioner's examination paper, or answer sheets, is documentary in its nature, and the only evidence peculiarly applicable to this petitioner is the comparison between her&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***36]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  examination paper and the fraudulent key, her testimony in denying that she used any fraudulent or illicit aid and assistance, the testimony of her husband that he knew that she had studied hard and constantly for some months prior to the examination, and the testimony of one character witness. The other evidence applies with equal force to each of those who were found by the Educational Testing Service to have submitted examination papers which corresponded substantially to the master fraudulent key; and, having heard this general testimony a number of times, a further repetition of hearing this testimony would not serve to enlighten the State Board of Education in its deliberations upon the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I construe the doctrine, due process requires that an administrative board, or body, when acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, must consider all the evidence before rendering its decision upon any particular question. This does not mean that this administrative board, or body, must itself hear the evidence, but it must have the evidence before it, and consider such evidence when rendering its decision. The record and evidence shows that this requirement has been met in rendering&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***37]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  its decision in the matter of the petitioner herein by the South Carolina State Board of Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner next asserts that, in notifying her that her certificate as a teacher in the public schools of South Carolina had been revoked, the State Board of Education notified her that it had been revoked for good and sufficient cause, and that such revocation is illegal, unlawful, and of no force and effect by reason of the fact that the State Board of Education does not have power to revoke Teachers' Certificates for good and sufficient cause, but only for immoral or unprofessional conduct, profanity, or evident unfitness for teaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In notifying petitioner that her state teachers' certificate had been revoked, the State Board of Education advised her that said Board, at its meeting on Wednesday, September 7, 1949, carefully considered the evidence brought out at the hearing on August 24th, 1949, when she was ruled to show cause why her certificate should not be revoked. The notice then proceeds to state that her certificate was revoked for good and sufficient cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rule to Show Cause, upon which a hearing in the matter of the petitioner was held on August 24th, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***38]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1949, clearly advised the petitioner that it had been made to appear to the State Board of Education that her State Teachers' Certificate should be revoked for immoral or unprofessional conduct and/or evident unfitness for teaching in that she had procured illicit or fraudulent aid and had used such aid for her assistance in taking the National Teacher Examination for the purpose of making a higher grade upon said examination than she was naturally capable of making and to cheat and defraud the State of South Carolina, its taxpayers and certain of its school children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the light of the specifications set out in the Rule to Show Cause served upon petitioner, upon which a hearing was held on August 24th, 1949, it is hardly subject to controversy that this petitioner knew exactly why, and upon what grounds, her certificate was revoked by the State Board of Education. Had she never been granted a hearing, had she not heard all the evidence pertiment to her particular case, then it might be said, with some merit, that the notification to her of the revocation of her certificate was defective. However, she has had a full hearing, has been fully advised of the grounds upon which her&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***39]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  certificate was revoked, and I find no merit in her position that the letter notifying her that her certificate had been revoked for good and sufficient cause, when considered with the Rule to Show Cause and hearing which preceded such letter was an unlawful exercise of power by the South Carolina State Board of Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are numerous other objections offered by petitioner to the validity of this finding of the South Carolina State Board of Education, but I find nothing in any of them which would justify setting aside the decision of the State Board of Education for error of law in the proceeding which is the basis for the revocation of this petitioner's teachers' certificate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven original fraudulent keys were all in evidence, the master fraudulent key was in evidence and available for comparison with each and all of these fraudulent keys confiscated from those taking the examination in South Carolina, a lengthy comparison of petitioner's examination paper with this master fraudulent key was made and, if petitioner desired further comparison made, her counsel was present at the hearing and had ample opportunity, on cross examination, to have those sections which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***40]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had not been compared actually compared by this representative of the Educational Testing Service; and, in general, it appears to me that petitioner has been fully advised and acquainted with all the evidence, facts and circumstances which are the basis for the Board's decision revoking her teachers' certificate, and has had ample opportunity to present all the evidence that she desired in opposition to such evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the foregoing reasons, therefore, it is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordered that the Petition of petitioner in this proceeding be, and the same hereby is, denied in every respect and detail, and that the action of the South Caroliina State Board of Education be, and the same hereby is, affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And It Is So Ordered.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher filed an action against the board that sought to reverse the board's finding that she had cheated on the teacher's examination. The trial court denied the teacher's petition and affirmed the board's order. The teacher appealed and challenged the admission of certain evidence at the trial court. The court affirmed the trial court's decree and overruled the teacher's exceptions. The court held that evidence of the fraudulent keys was properly admitted. The evidence established that seven fraudulent keys were used to compile the master fraudulent key. A comparison of the examination papers with the master key disclosed that cheating had taken place on a wide scale. Further, the court found that the trial court's inadvertence in considering matters outside of the record resulted in no prejudice to the teacher. The trial court judge referred to the fact that every member of the board attended certain hearings. The court found that the court's reference to that fact was immaterial and did not affect the trial court's conclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  George W. McKown, as a citizen and taxpayer of Cherokee County, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, and Lee Allison, former sheriff of such county, and Roland T. Clary, present sheriff thereof, respectively, brought proceedings against J. O. Daniel, as County Supervisor, and Bez Blanton and others, constituting the Board of County Commissioners, for writs of mandamus commanding the Board to pass on plaintiffs Allison's and Clary's claims for fees due them for performance of their duties as sheriff during certain periods of their incumbencies. From a judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Cherokee County, J. Henry Johnson, J., reducing the amounts of the claims and ordering payment of the reduced amounts, on appeal from the Board's orders approving the claims in part and rejecting them in part, all the parties appealed. The Supreme Court, Per Curiam, held that defendants' contention that sums alleged to have been illegally paid plaintiffs as fees for periods before those involved in the proceedings should be offset against the instant claims was properly rejected by the Common Pleas Court as outside the pleadings, which were expressly limited to specific claims submitted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to and passed on by the Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgment modified and affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Order of Judge J. HENRY JOHNSON in the Clary Case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause arises out of a controversy over certain fees and costs asserted by the Plaintiff, the present Sheriff of Cherokee County, and is before this Court upon appeal from an Order of the Defendants, constituting the Board of County Commissioners of Cherokee County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A brief recital of the background and history will be sufficient to disclose the nature of the controversy and the manner in and extent to which it is before this Court. The appeal in this Court was argued before the undersigned while presiding over the Court of Common Pleas for Cherokee County and was taken under advisement, with the understanding that the Attorneys for the contesting parties would prepare and file written Briefs, which have been filed and have been of substantial assistance to the Court, but the nature of the questions involved, the detail which the questions present and the importance of the points to be decided necessarily entailed some delay in the preparation and filing of the Briefs, and thereafter of this Order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Plaintiff is Sheriff of Cherokee&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  County and has held that office since January 7th, 1947. His claims for fees and costs were paid to July 1st, 1947, and thereafter he filed claims for the period from July 1st, 1947, to December 31st, 1947, aggregating $ 7,296.87. The County Board of Commissioners having failed or refused to pass upon these claims (except some small amounts of no consequence), Plaintiff instituted an action against the Defendants, constituting the County Board of Commissioners, seeking a writ of mandamus to require this Board to pass upon his claims for this six months period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Petitioner, George W. McKown, in his capacity as a taxpayer and as an intervenor in this case, was not a party to that proceeding, formally entering this controversy as hereinafter stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Plaintiff's Petition for a writ of mandamus was heard before Hon. T. S. Sease, Resident Circuit Judge of the Seventh Circuit, who issued the writ prayed for, but required, upon the application of the Defendant-County Board, that the claims be audited by an independent auditing firm, not resident in Cherokee County, and the Order specifically providing that this audit should be for the period from July 1st, 1947, to December&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  31st, 1947, and for no other months. In consequence of that Order, the Defendant-Board employed the auditing firm of Geo. G. Scott &amp; Company of Charlotte, North Carolina. Thereupon, the Petitioner herein, through his Attorneys, served formal Notice upon the members of the County Board, Defendants herein, and upon the County Attorney, demanding that the audit include detailed consideration of certain specific matters, demanding that such intervening Petitioner and his Attorneys be given due notice and opportunity to be heard with respect to any matters relating to the controversy, objecting to the allowance of various types of the claimed fees and costs, demanding that previous periods also be audited and disallowance made for such previous periods of items asserted to be illegal, and that the Board, Defendants herein, appeal from any adverse allowance of such fees and costs and the other points covered by this formal demand. These matters all appear by reference to this formal written Notice, demand and objections, signed by the Petitioner's Attorneys and served on all interested parties, it not being necessary to further detail the contents thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently for the reason&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that it was impossible for the auditing firm to complete the audit by the deadline fixed by Judge Sease's Order, the time for filing the same was extended by consent and thereafter the audit was duly filed with the County Board and evidently copies thereof furnished to the Petitioner and to the Plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a companion case to this one, similar in most respects to this case, involving Lee Allison, a former Sheriff of Cherokee County, and which is being disposed of by a separate Order which will be filed at the same time as this Order. In that case Judge Sease likewise issued a writ of mandamus and the audit was made by the same firm of accountants, having been filed prior to the audit in the Clary case, and the controversy in the Allison case having actually been heard prior to the filing of the audit and the hearing in the Clary case. In the Allison case the Petitioner filed an independent proceeding, asking relief including many of the matters covered by his contest in this case, and that proceeding was heard by Special Judge Proctor A. Bonham and resulted in an Order that Petitioner be formally made a party to the contest over the Allison claim for fees, and that all&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  questions be determined in that main contest before the Defendant-Board, the result of which is that the Allison case, as well as this case, has been litigated by the proceedings before the County Board and by appeal from its Orders. Substantially the same course of procedure was adopted in this case, that is, that Petitioner in his capacity as a taxpayer, was considered and regarded, and in fact was, a party to these proceedings and his right to such position as a party in this litigation recognized by the Plaintiff and by the Defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under this situation a hearing was first held in the Allison case before the Defendant-Board, at which certain evidence was taken and proceedings were had, in fact constituting a trial between the Petitioner and the Plaintiff over the various legal and factual questions involved, before the Defendant-Board as the body holding original jurisdiction. The Board reached its conclusion in that case, disallowing certain of the fees and costs claimed by former Sheriff Allison, but allowing a certain amount as just claims against the County. As in this case, both the Plaintiff and the Petitioner appealed from that Order of the Board in the Allison case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thereafter the Clary case likewise and in a similar manner came on for trial before the Defendant-Board, and at that hearing further proceedings were had and further evidence taken, in addition to which it was stipulated among the parties that the evidence taken in the Allison hearing would have equal application to the Clary case, except as the details of the two claims were different. Following that hearing the County Board of Commissioners issued, under date of November 17th, 1948, the following Order in this case:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pursuant to and in compliance with the Order of Honorable T. S. Sease, Resident Circuit Judge, Seventh Judicial Circuit, in the case of Roland T. Clary, Plaintiff, v. J. O. Daniel, as Supervisor, and Bez Blanton, Kye Royle, Monroe Sanders, L. B. Jolly, W. F. Burgess and W. R. Hambright, as members of the County Board of Commissioners for Cherokee County, Defendants, it was moved and seconded and passed unanimously of all present (all being present except W. R. Hambright) that all the claims of Roland T. Clary be and the same are hereby passed upon and approved in the sum of Four Thousand Eight Hundred Four and 50/100 ($ 4,804.50) Dollars, and find that this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  amount is a just claim against the County of Cherokee; and find further that the remainder of the said claims as filed be and the same is hereby disapproved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Done in Board assembled at Gaffney, South Carolina, this the 7th day of October (November?), Anno Domini, 1948.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was signed by the Supervisor and the four members of the Board of Commissioners attending the hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this Order of the Board and from certain rulings at the hearing, Petitioner has appealed to this Court, specifying a number of different points in which he asserts that the Board was in error. The Plaintiff likewise appealed, his single exception being to the effect that the Board was in error in not allowing the entire amount of the claim as filed by him. It is not necessary that the exceptions be considered seriatim, as the exceptions are in written form and will disclose the points presented by them and what is said in this Order will dispose of these contentions according to their substantial nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim filed by the Plaintiff, Clary, as presented to the County Board of Commissioners for the period from July 1st, 1947, through December 31st, 1947, aggregates $ 7,296.87. With&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  corrections made by the Auditor for errors in addition and for amounts allowed, but not claimed, the total claim under consideration comes to $ 7,344.40. Of this amount the Auditor recommended the disallowance of $ 2,539.90, and the allowance of the difference of $ 4,804.50, which latter amount is the one found by the County Board of Commissioners to represent the fees and costs for this period for which the Plaintiff has &quot;a just claim against the County of Cherokee&quot;. Except to the extent that the findings of the Board are modified herein, I am of the opinion, and so hold, that the findings of fact and conclusions of law which are implicit in the conclusion reached by the Board should be concurred in and approved by the Court, and it is so ordered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount found by the Board in favor of the Plaintiff is $ 4,804.50. This must be modified to this extent: That the Plaintiff is also entitled to the allowance of $ 22.00 additional for arrest warrants by Deputy Sheriffs, but of the amount allowed by the Board there should be disallowed $ 675.75 for arrest warrants served by rural policemen, $ 56.50 for dieting of Blacksburg prisoners and $ 8.00 for duplications of dieting prisoners&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the County Jail, which leaves a net amount of $ 4,086.25, which is adjudged to be the total amount of valid claims in favor of the Plaintiff, Roland T. Clary, as Sheriff of Cherokee County, to and including December 31st, 1947. All other claims on his part to and including that date be and the same are hereby disallowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brief explanation should be made of the modifications herein made of the amount approved by the Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first of these is the allowance to the Plaintiff of $ 22.00 additional for arrest warrants for Deputy Sheriffs. This comes about in this way: That where an arrest warrant contained the name of more than one Defendant, the Auditor and the Board only allowed $ 1.00, regardless of the number of persons named in the arrest warrant, whereas under the Statute (Section 4955 of the 1942 Code) the charge should be $ 1.00 for each person named in the warrant, and the record shows that $ 22.00 is the amount that should be allowed to give full credit on this basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have disallowed $ 675.95 representing claims on the part of the Plaintiff for arrest warrants served by rural policemen of Cherokee County. The Auditor and the County Board of Commissioners&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  disallowed the Plaintiff's claims for mileage of rural policemen, evidently upon the proper principle that the County paid the salaries and travel expenses, as well as costs of uniforms of the rural policemen, therefore, the Sheriff is not entitled to mileage for transportation which the County has already paid for. However, the Auditor and the Board allowed the Plaintiff's claims for arrest warrants served by rural policemen. In this the Board was in error. The Sheriff is not entitled to any fees or costs for services performed by rural policemen (it should be stated that the record shows that where both a rural policeman and a Deputy Sheriff were present when an arrest was made, that the Plaintiff's claim was allowed, but it is only in those cases where the participating officer was a rural policeman only that there is a disallowance). The services performed by rural police are services performed, not by the Sheriff, but by separate officers created by separate statute and paid for by the County. The compensation claimed in this connection falls under Section 4955, the Statute designating the fees for Magistrates' Constables, upon the theory that the Sheriff acts as Constable for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Magistrate and is, therefore, entitled to these fees. This is true as to the Sheriff and his Deputies, but not to the separate and independent officers comprising the rural police force of Cherokee County. It is provided by Section 3861 of the Code that the amounts payable to Constables shall be reduced by the amounts paid to any other person for performing the services which the Constable otherwise would have performed. And, clearly, the rural police are officers for whose services the Sheriff is not entitled to make claim for fees and costs. The rural police system of Cherokee County was created by an Act which is now Section 3792-11 of the 1942 Code and, without reciting the details of this Act, it is plain that the intent and effect of the Act was to create a separate law enforcement body, different from the Sheriff's organization, and the payment for whose services the County provides directly. In the Cherokee County Supply Act is contained the salary of these officers, as well as the mileage and uniforms, so the County is entitled to the results of the services so paid for, and not the Sheriff. The Act specifically provides that the reports and records of the rural policemen&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shall be kept separate from all other items handled by the Sheriff in his office, and that &quot;All fines and penalties collected or received by the sheriff resulting from the work of the rural policemen * * * shall be kept separate from other funds in his office and shall be turned over to the treasurer's office every three months and shall take a receipt in due form for same&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the idea that the Sheriff is entitled to the fees and costs for services performed by the rural policemen is a sound one, then the quoted provision convicts the Legislature of having done a foolish thing for it would have no meaning or effect under those circumstances. It also seems plain to me that the use of the words &quot;All fines and penalties&quot; is an obvious legislative error, and that what was intended to be said was that all fees and costs of the rural policemen should be kept separate and turned into the treasurer's office. Neither the Sheriff, Deputy Sheriffs, nor rural policemen collect or are entitled to any fine or penalty, so the language would be meaningless if read literally. The purpose of judicial construction of Statutes is to arrive at the intent of the Legislature and, where wrong words&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are used, but the real intent is obvious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Courts are not always confined to the literal meaning of a statute; the real purpose and intent of the lawmakers will prevail over the literal import of the words * * *. A Statute as a whole must receive a practical, reasonable and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design and policy of the lawmakers * * * It is also an old and well-established rule that words ought to be subservient to the intent, and not the intent to the words&quot; (Ashley v. Ware Shoals Mfg. Co., 210 S.C. 273, 42 S.E. 390).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I conclude, therefore, and so hold, that the Sheriff of Cherokee County is not entitled to any fees or costs for services performed by the rural policemen of Cherokee County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The item of $ 56.50 disallowed under the designation of dieting Blacksburg prisoners arises in this way: Many, if not most, prisoners arrested in the vicinity of Blacksburg are placed in the Town jail there and are not brought to the County jail at Gaffney at all. Under an arrangement made by the Sheriff with a cafe in Blacksburg these prisoners were fed there and the Sheriff filed claim for the amounts so paid this cafe. However, it developed that these&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  same prisoners, though never brought to the County Jail, were included on the jail list and, therefore, on the claims for dieting prisoners at 70 [cents] per day, and this is an obvious duplication, so that when the Sheriff is reimbursed for the costs of feeding these prisoners in Blacksburg, he is not entitled to charge for having fed them at the County jail. This amounts to the disallowed total of $ 56.50.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $ 8.00 item disallowed under the designation duplications for dieting prisoners arises from the fact that certain prisoners were placed in jail under two warrants and, when the claim for dieting prisoners was made up, claims for some of these prisoners were made twice for the same day, because of the duplication of charges against them. Obviously the Sheriff is entitled to only one per diem dieting charge for the same day for any prisoner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now proper to make brief reference to the nature of the claims for fees and costs disallowed by the Board, as affirmed by this Order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sheriff filed claim for services performed solely by State Highway Patrolmen and State Constables and for mileage for these State officers. The State pays these officers, furnishes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  their vehicles and they operate under special Statutes relating to their duties and jurisdictions. Clearly the Sheriff is not entitled to charge the County for services performed by peace officers of the State nor for mileage in the use of the State's vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have already pointed out one of the reasons why no charge may be made by the Sheriff for any services or expenses of rural policemen, but it is worthy of comment that much of the disallowed claim of the Sheriff consisted of claims for the service of witness warrants by rural policemen and for mileage of rural policemen. As is held hereinabove, the Sheriff is entitled to no charge on account of the rural policemen, but further the claim for witness warrant fees is likewise disallowable for the same reason as claimed charges for the service of witness warrants of all other officers, most of which has been disallowed. The disallowance is based upon the proposition that the evidence shows that, with very few and isolated exceptions, no witness warrants were even issued, and very few served. The Statute makes a distinction between witness warrants and arrest warrants, but even if it be concluded that the inclusion of the names&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the witnesses in the arrest warrant is tantamount to the issuance of a witness warrant (which I conclude it is not), nevertheless the fee for witness warrants, so far as the Sheriff is concerned, is for the service of the warrant and not simply for its issuance. And the record discloses to a large extent on the testimony of former Sheriff Allison and Plaintiff-Sheriff Clary that witness warrants were not actually served in but very few cases. The propriety of disallowing these claims is further emphasized by the fact that the overwhelming percentage of the witnesses for whom claims were made on the basis of alleged service of witness warrants were the arresting officers. The evidence shows that no service was ever effected on these arresting officers, and if the Sheriff had had one of his Deputies serve another Deputy, who was the arresting officer, it appears that this would not constitute a substantial basis for a charge for the service of a witness warrant, as there would be no occasion therefor. Except, therefore, as allowed, the charges for witness warrants represent claims for services that were not performed and they were properly disallowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other items disallowed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are comparatively small in amount, but what has been said to the principal items is of like application to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should be commented that this case only involves claims for fees and witnesses in criminal cases. The Sheriff apparently collects his civil fees as his own property and no contest is involved as to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff contends that the Auditor, and the Board, have failed to take into account the Sheriff's own records and have proceeded upon unreliable records in the case of some of the Magistrates. But my examination of the evidence is such that I find that the Board reached the proper conclusion, even though the evidence may be in dispute as to its allowance and disallowance of the several portions of the Plaintiff's claims, and that, under the evidence, the Board reached the same conclusion to which my own study of the record leads me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains only to dispose of certain legal contentions advanced by the Petitioner. First of all, it should be commented that the Petitioner stresses the underlying proposition that it is exclusively a legislative function to levy taxes and appropriate public moneys and fix the purposes for which and the amounts within which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such public money shall be expended, and that deficit spending should be discouraged and prevented. The Court is in entire accord with this laudable purpose of the proper control over public funds, and with the Petitioner's underlying argument in that respect. However, the positions taken by the Petitioner, in undertaking to limit the allowance of costs to the Plaintiff in this case to the amounts appropriated by the Cherokee County Supply Act, and other positions connected therewith, cannot, in my opinion, be sustained under the present status of the Statutes, and I will briefly recite the Petitioner's contentions and explain my reasons for denying such contentions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner contends, first of all, that the amounts appropriated by the Cherokee County Act are the maximum amounts for which claims may be approved for Sheriff's costs, and relies upon Section 4084 of the 1942 Code, as applying specifically to Cherokee County, and Sections 1508, 1592, 3073, 3074 and 3143 as statewide Statutes prohibiting the approval of claims or the expenditure of public moneys beyond the amounts appropriated by law. There was no Supply Act enacted for Cherokee County for the year 1947, so under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the general State Statute the 1946 Supply Act was applicable for 1947. Under that Supply Act there were appropriated for the Sheriff's office the following amounts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salary for Sheriff $ 1,000.00; Sheriff's Constables $ 5,000.00 (this is the appropriation for the costs, fees and expenses involved in the Plaintiff's claims herein); and jail expenses, including dieting of prisoners $ 5,000.00 (there were also appropriated the further following amounts for law enforcement which are not directly involved in this controversy; Salaries of rural police $ 6,480.00; travel allowance for rural police $ 2,400.00; uniforms for Deputy Sheriffs and rural policemen $ 420.00, and salaries for Deputy Sheriffs $ 4,860.00).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is obviously true that, since practically $ 10,000.00 had been approved and paid for fees, costs, mileage and dieting prisoners for the period up to July 1st, 1947, that the allowance of additional claims to the Sheriff for the rest of the year will exceed the amounts appropriated for these purposes, and it is the position of the Petitioner that the allowance of such claims would be violative of the sections of the Code referred to, as well as the provisions of the Supply&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Act. It is recognized that officers (other than as specifically mentioned by the Constitution, inapplicable here) have no vested right in the emoluments of the office and that they may be changed from time to time as the Legislature sees fit. The Statutes, however, under which the Sheriff here claims are statewide Statutes and, until 1935, it was not permissible that the Legislature make special provision as to a particular County different from these general Statutes. Salley v. McCoy, 182 S.C. 249, 189 S.E. 196. But it was held by the Supreme Court that, notwithstanding the 1935 amendment to Article 3, Section 34, subdivision IX permits such special legislation with respect to the compensation of the officers of particular Counties, that could not be done by the Supply Act (Scott v. Anderson County, 195 S.C. 92, 10 S.E.2d 359). Petitioner recognizes this rule, but contends that the enactment of Section 4084 and the other sections mentioned in the 1942 Code constitutes the enactment of a Statute in accordance with the 1935 amendment as required by the rule stated in the Scott case. However, it is my opinion that this is not a sufficient legislative adoption specifically of a change&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the method of paying the Sheriff of Cherokee County, so as to limit the amounts payable to him as costs and fees to the amounts appropriated by the Supply Act. It is not questioned but that, since the 1935 amendment, this could be done, but it is my view that the necessary Statute has not been enacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner also contends that the allowance of additional claims for this period to the Plaintiff-Sheriff is violative of the provisions of Section 11 of the Cherokee County Supply Act under consideration, which provides in effect that the amounts therein appropriated shall be paid out as near as practical one-twelfth each month, and if there is any overpayment in any one month, that it shall be deducted the following month. If it had sufficiently been legislated as to Cherokee County to make special provision for the payment of compensation to the Sheriff so as to remove him from the general effect of the statewide Statutes, and limit him to the amounts appropriated in any particular Supply Act, then this would be a correct position, but, as indicated just above, the necessary special legislation has not been enacted to accomplish this purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner also insists that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the allowance of claims to the Plaintiff for this period of time should not be made without determining and deducting the amounts paid to the Sheriff for preceding periods for amounts that represent fees not legally collectible, such as fees for witness warrants not served, unallowable mileage, etc., similar to those disallowed for the period under consideration. It is true that the evidence shows that claims for fees were made and allowed in previous periods on exactly the same basis as made for this period, and that, therefore, it would appear that there have been paid amounts in previous periods for items of costs not legally applicable. This is demonstrated by the testimony of former Sheriff Allison (made applicable to the Clary case) and by the testimony of the Special Auditor who prepared this audit. The Petitioner also has insisted throughout that an audit should be made for this previous period, if necessary, in order to establish the exact amount of such disallowable, but previously paid, items. I am of the opinion that this position should be overruled. The period of time involved in this litigation is only from July 1st, 1947, to December 31st, 1947, and the Order of Judge&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sease specifically limited the making of the audit to this six-month period, and no other months. Furthermore, the claims for these previous months have already been allowed and paid, and it does not seem to me that now the approval of the claims by the County Board of Commissioners, and their payment upon such approval, can be reopened and inquired into. See Richland County v. Miller, 16 S.C. 244, and 16 S.C. 236, and Section 3871 of the 1942 Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are other positions incidental to these major contentions, but what has been said substantially disposes of all positions of the Petitioner presented by the exceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All exceptions of both Plaintiff and Petitioner, except those sustained by the findings and holdings herein made, be and the same are hereby overruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is Ordered and Adjudged that the Plaintiff, Roland T. Clary, as Sheriff of Cherokee County, is entitled to and has valid claims against Cherokee County for $ 4,086.25 for the period from July 1st, 1947, to December 31st, 1947, and the same are approved to this extent, but all others claims disallowed and refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is Accordingly so Ordered.</SPAN></P>

What has been said in the Clary Order is of equal application to this case, except as to amounts and that Order is, therefore, made a part of this Order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Order of the County Board of Commissioners is this case approved as valid claims in favor of Lee Allison against Cherokee County in the amount of $ 1,393.45. This finding is approved with these modifications:</SPAN></P>

R. Bull, individually and as executor of the will of Walter P. Bull, and B. M. Bull, copartners, doing business under the trade-name and style of Star Cleaners &amp; Laundry, and John Burns was appointed receiver of Star Cleaners &amp; Laundry. The National Cash Register Company, a corporation, filed its claim in the receivership proceedings for balance due for cash registers which it had sold to the Star Cleaners &amp; Laundry under title retention, installment contracts which were chattel mortgages, and which provided for monthly payments of $ 105.00. The County Court of Greenville County, W. B. McGowan, J., rendered an order directing the receiver to pay the National Cash Register Company, a corporation, five per cent a year on balance of $ 1,077.00 owing for the cash registers, and the National Cash Register Company, a corporation, appealed. The Supreme Court, Stukes J., held that the National Cash Register Company, a corporation, was confined for its remedy to the forum of the receivership, but that County Court could not prevent enforcement of the liens of the National Cash Register Company, a corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to receivership, the creditor had sold the company cash registers, payment for which was $ 105 monthly. The creditor established its claims with the receiver and without notice to the creditor, the trial court ordered that payments to the creditor should be $ 50 per month. The creditor petitioned for possession of the machines in accordance with the contracts and amended at the hearing to ask in the alternative for a sale of the mortgaged property by the receiver in foreclosure of the liens. The trial court denied the petition and modified the order. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The trial court erred when it prevented enforcement of the liens. The installment contracts were properly considered by the parties as chattel mortgages and the validity of them as liens was unquestioned. The legal right to enforcement had already been suspended unduly long by the receivership. The court held that the trial court violated the constitutional limitations and abused its discretion with respect to the administration of the property in receivership. It was unjust and therefore inequitable to deny the creditor the right to enforcement of its liens.</SPAN></P>

From decisions of the Common Pleas Court of Charleston County, William H. Grimball, J., holding the acts to be unconstitutional, F. O. Smith and others and Harry L. Carter, Jr., and others, respectively, appealed. The Supreme Court, Stukes, J., held that Act April 14, 1948, 45 St. at Large, p. 1996, and Act April 24, 1948, 45 St. at Large, p. 2004, authorizing commissioners of the public service district of Charleston County to promulgate and enforce zoning regulations, were invalid as violative of constitutional prohibition against enactment of a special law in cases where a general law can be made applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Common Pleas Court of Charleston County (South Carolina) declared invalid two acts authorizing the commissioners of a certain public service district to promulgate and enforce zoning regulations. Appellants sought review of the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents argued, and the lower court concurred, that the acts in question were invalid because they conflicted with &sect; 34 of Art. III, subsection 9, of the State Constitution of 1895, which prohibited the enactment by the legislature of a special law in cases where a general law could be made applicable. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that there was no showing in the record of any need for special legislation for the named public service district. The court found that the authority of government to zone the use of privately owned property was founded in the police power. The court found that there no good reason appeared why the police power should be exercised by the corporate authorities of one district and not by the others, particularly when those districts were comparable in size and population. Nothing in the acts authorizing the commissioners to promulgate and enforce zoning regulations justified the classification. The court found that because the subject of the legislation was reasonably susceptible to general treatment, the special treatment contained in the acts violated the constitutional prohibition.</SPAN></P>

Harrell and others, personally and on behalf of all persons having similar interests, and H. G. Moore and others, personally and on behalf of all persons having similar interests, brought separate suits against the City of Columbia, its mayor and members of the city council, for judgment declaring elections for annexation of areas to the city, null and void, and for injunctive relief. The Court of Common Pleas of Richland County, T. B. Greneker, J., ordered that the complaints should be dismissed and rules to show cause dissolved, and plaintiffs appealed. The Supreme Court, L. D.

The evidence showed the town's population, the use of the streets, and the need of the public for the crossing. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court was bound by the findings of fact of the board, which were approved by the circuit court judge, as there was evidence upon which to base the findings. The evidence supported the order for the street crossing. The order was not a taking in violation of the railroad's due process rights, as the railroad was subject to state police power, and it received its charter and franchise subject to the implied right of the state to open streets across its right of way.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action by G. A. Kalber against J. B. Redfearn and others, constituting the Board of Trustees of Hartsville School District No. 32 of Darlington County, the State of South Carolina, for determination of whether joint resolution proposing amendment to constitution was required to be presented to Governor before becoming effective. From an adverse judgment, plaintiff appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exceptions overruled and judgment affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Order of Judge Lewis follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This matter comes before me on motion of the plaintiff to overrule the demurrer to his complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff is a resident and taxpayer of Hartsville School District No. 32, of Darlington County, the State of South Carolina. The defendants constitute the Board of Trustees of said School District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue here requires the determination of a constitutional question, novel in this jurisdiction. It is the question of whether it is required that there be presented to the Governor, in the manner contemplated by Section 23, Article IV, of the Constitution, Joint Resolutions adopted by the General Assembly pursuant to Section 1 of Article&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  XVI, proposing amendments to the Constitution of the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1948 session of the General Assembly adjourned sine die on Thursday, April 15th, 1948. On that date, three Joint Resolutions, each proposing Amendments to the Constitution, were duly enrolled, ratified, and signed by the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives. Each of these contained proposals that Section 5 of Article X of the Constitution be amended by enlarging the then existing debt limits of three school districts (See Permanent Senate Journal for 1948, pages 1473, 1479 and 1481). The Joint Resolution, which is concerned in this litigation, 45 Stat. at Large, page 2586, proposed that the original provisions of Section 5, Article X, imposing a limit on Hartsville School District No. 32 be stricken therefrom and in lieu of the original provisions that said School District be authorized to issue bonds to an amount not exceeding fifteen per centum (15%) of the assessed value of all taxable property therein. Section 3 of the Joint Resolution provided that the Resolution should take effect upon its approval by the Governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears that after the original Joint Resolution was enrolled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and ratified by the action of the two Houses, and signed by the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House, it was delivered on the same day by the Clerk of the Senate to the Governor, in accordance with Rule 7 of the Joint Rules of the Senate and House. Thereafter, the Governor wrote across the cover of the Joint Resolution:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Amendment to Constitution--Governor's Signature not required. J. Strom Thurmond, April 17, 1948.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governor Thurmond's action in respect to this Resolution was similar to his action on every Joint Resolution proposing amendments to the Constitution that were adopted by the General Assembly during his term of office. But in all cases, except with respect to the three Resolutions enrolled on this particular day (April 15th, 1948), his failure to return them to the House in which they originated within the time limit prescribed by Section 23 of Article IV, had the same effect upon these other Joint Resolutions, as though he had signed them. Cf. Goree v. Greenwood County Supervisor, 93 S.C. 312, 76 S.E. 705.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notwithstanding the fact that the Governor failed to approve the Joint Resolution, the Secretary of State submitted the question proposed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the Joint Resolution in the General Election held on November 2nd, 1948, on which occasion the same was approved by a vote of 3,392 to 605. During its 1949 session, the General Assembly ratified the proposed amendment as a part of the State Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Governor's action in refusing to approve this Joint Resolution squarely raises the question of whether his approval was necessary, for it is seen from the foregoing recitation of facts that the General Assembly's adjournment on the day that the Joint Resolution was presented to him prevented the running of the three-day period provided for in Section 23, Article IV of the Constitution. His action also raises the subordinate question as to whether this particular Resolution became effective in time to justify the submission of the question at the 1948 Election, notwithstanding that it might be unnecessary for the Governor to sign Resolutions of this sort, because by its own terms it provided that it should not take effect until it had been signed by the Governor. If the answer to this question be the negative, then the Joint Resolution did not finally become effective until two days following the convening of the 1949 General&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Assembly, to wit, on January 13th, 1949, with the result that the proposal submitted at the election held in November, 1948, was prematurely submitted. I shall discuss these questions in the order presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question 1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do Joint Resolutions proposing Amendments to the Constitution of this State and agreed to by two-thirds of the members elected to each House fall within the purview of Section 23, Article IV of the Constitution, which provides that &quot;Every Bill or Joint Resolution which shall have passed the General Assembly, except on a question of adjournment, shall, before it becomes a Law, be presented to the Governor * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, of course, a recognized principle of American constitutional law that questions relating to the Constitution of the several States must be interpreted by the Courts of each State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The conformity with the State Constitution of the proceedings in the enactment of the law is a question for the determination of the State Court and its judgment is final.&quot; Smith, Rec'r. v. Jennings, 206 U.S. 276, 27 S. Ct. 610, 611, 51 L. Ed. 1061.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this reason, decisions of other courts interpreting questions arising under the Constitution of their&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  respective States are interesting and, perhaps, persuasive, but they are not controlling. Consequently, it occurred to me that I should first examine this question from the standpoint of the present Constitution of South Carolina, and former Constitutions of this State, and decide the question, if possible, by reference to those documents, and afterwards determine if my views found support in the Courts of other jurisdictions. With that in mind, I have examined not only the provisions of our present Constitution, but I have referred also to our former Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its disavowance of allegiance to the British Crown, South Carolina has had five Constitutions. The first is that adopted by the Congress held in Charleston over the period beginning November 1st, 1775, and ending March 26th, 1776. This document is referred to as the &quot;Constitution of South Carolina, 26th of March, 1776&quot;. Two matters, of interest to this question, appear in this document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first place, there is no provision in the document for its amendment. In this respect, the document is statutory in nature, for its alteration could take place by subsequent statutory enactments. Just such an alteration&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  did take place with the enactment of March 19, 1778, which was the Act of the General Assembly establishing the Constitution of 1778.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second matter of interest in the 1776 document is the provision of Article VII, which vested the legislative authority of the Colony, as this State was referred to in that document, in the President (of the Colony), the General Assembly (a body comparable to the present House of Representatives) and the Legislative Council (a body whose modern counterpart with enlarged powers is the Senate). Article VIII provided that all bills must be presented to the President and that they would not become law without his assent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitution established in 1778 vested the legislative authority in a General Assembly to consist of two distinct bodies, a Senate and a House of Representatives. It thus removed the veto power which existed under the Constitution of 1776. It also provided that the document itself might not be amended without 90 days notice and unless a majority of the members of the House of Representatives and the Senate consent. The Constitution of 1778 remained in force until that adopted in 1790, which, because of the fact that it is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  our first Constitution adopted subsequent to the adoption of the Constitution of the United States and afterwards remained in effect for 78 years, makes it a document of considerable significance. Under this document there was no power of veto, the applicable Section providing merely that Bills and Ordinances should have the force of law when the same had been read three times on three several days in each House, had the Great Seal affixed to it, and had been signed in the Senate House by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives (Section 16, Article I). Article XI provided for the amendment of the Constitution and because there exists a significant difference between this provision and those appearing in the Constitutions of 1868 and 1895, I shall make reference to it. It states, in part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No part of this constitution shall be altered, unless a bill to alter the same shall have been read three times in the house of representatives, and three times in the senate, and agreed to by two-thirds of both branches of the whole representation * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I shall later emphasize that those writing this document contemplated that the vehicle proposing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  amendments to it be in the form of a Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitution of 1868 restored the veto power of the State's Chief Executive. Section 22, Article III. The provisions of this Section are, for the purposes of this discussion, substantially identical to the provisions now appearing in the present Constitution and found therein as Section 23 of Article IV. The veto power in both documents provides that,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every Bill or Joint Resolution which shall have passed the General Assembly, except on the question of adjournment, shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the Governor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitution of 1868 contained provisions permitting its amendment. Article XV of that document prescribes the way in which the Constitution is to be amended, and while, once again, minor differences exist between the provisions of the Constitution of 1868, dealing with the amendment of that document, and those found in the Constitution of 1895, as Article XVI, for the purpose of this discussion, the provisions may be deemed identical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provisions of the two Constitutions dealing with the manner of proposing amendments, provide:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That any amendment or amendments to this Constitution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  may be proposed in the Senate or the House of Representatives if the same be agreed to by two-thirds of the members elected to each House, such amendment or amendments shall be entered on the Journals respectively, with the yeas and nays taken thereon; and the same shall be submitted to the qualified electors of the State, at the next general election thereafter for Representatives * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some twelve amendments were made to the Constitution of 1868. An examination of the Statutes at Large of South Carolina for the applicable years shows that in every instance the amendments were proposed by Joint Resolutions. Apparently, each was presented to the Governor for in every instance there appears a notation that the same was approved. Countless amendments have been proposed to the Constitution of 1895, and from an examination of the legislative action taken in proposing these amendments, it seems that the Joint Resolution has invariably been the vehicle used by the General Assembly. In every instance, they were submitted to the Governor for his approval and most of them contain a provision similar to that found in Section 3 of this Resolution, providing that the Joint Resolution should&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  take effect upon its approval by the Governor. In at least one instance, the Governor has undertaken to veto a Joint Resolution. In 1938, the General Assembly, by Joint Resolution, proposed to amend the Constitution to provide for the retirement of Judges of the Supreme Court and Circuit Courts. This Resolution was delivered to Governor Johnston on May 9th, 1938, and he vetoed it subsequent to the adjournment of the General Assembly on July 23, 1938. Notwithstanding his veto, the question proposed was submitted in the election held in November of that year, but failed to carry. When it was returned to the House of Representatives, from whence it originated, the Speaker ruled the matter of the veto out of order because of the fact that the proposal had failed to carry in the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been strongly argued to me, that this course of conduct on the part of the General Assembly, in submitting Joint Resolutions proposing Amendments, to the Executive, since the restoration of the veto power by the 1868 Constitution, requires the Court to construe Section 1 of Article XVI, and Section 23 of Article IV in such a way as to harmonize the two. It has been urged that the longstanding&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  precedent, followed by each General Assembly, for a period of nearly 90 years, and the acquiescence therein by all of the State's Chief Executives, except the present incumbent, establishes a persuasive, if not a binding precedent. I recognize that the Courts, where possible, will adopt a construction of a constitutional provision in keeping with the construction given to the provision by the coordinate branches of the Government. But such constructions are not controlling. In the last resort, the Constitution must be interpreted by the Court. Gentry v. Taylor, 192 S.C. 145, 5 S.E.2d 857. For this reason, I do not consider the precedent of these many years controlling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My attention has also been directed to decisions of our Court declaring that Joint Resolutions, proposing amendments to the Constitution, were subject in certain respects to the Enrolled Bill Rule. For example, there is the case of Lucas v. Barringer, 120 S.C. 68, 112 S.E. 746, 750, in which the following appears:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The plaintiff had introduced in evidence, over objection of defendants, the whole Senate and House Journals for 1918, and attempted to show that the joint resolution had not received three readings&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in either the Senate or House, and on the third reading in the Senate it had not been entered in the journal in form as amended, and that the journal entries were not in accordance with the requirements of article 16, &sect; 1 of the Constitution. The defendants objected to any further examination of the Journals being made, inasmuch as they had shown that the joint resolution had been entered once on both the Senate and House Journals with the yea and nay votes thereon, and this one entry fulfilled the constitutional requirements, and, as the certificate of the Secretary of State attached to the copy of the joint resolution certified that it had been read three times on three several days in each house of the General Assembly, duly ratified and signed by the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives, approved by the Governor and the great seal of the state impressed thereon, the court was not at liberty to inquire further into what the journals of the two houses may show as to the successive steps which may have been taken in the passage of the original joint resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I sustained the objection and would not allow the introduction of the balance of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  journals, and did so under the ruling in the case of State ex rel. Hoover v. Town Council of Chester, 39 S.C. 307, 17 S.E. 752, and Graham v. Ervin, 114 S.C. 419, 103 S.E. 750.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar indications that a Joint Resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution was subject to certain phases of the Enrolled Bill Rule appear in Stevenson v. Carrison, 122 S.C. 212, 115 S.E. 251, and Fleming v. Royall, 145 S.C. 438, 143 S.E. 162, 167.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctrine of the Enrolled Bill Rule was established in this State by the decision of our Supreme Court in the case of State ex rel. Hoover v. Chester, supra, a decision which overruled earlier decisions of our Court, approving the examination of the original Journals of the Houses to determine the contents of Statutes. The definition of the Enrolled Bill Rule given in the case of State ex rel. Hoover v. Chester, supra, has been frequently quoted as follows [39 S.C. 307, 17 S.E. 755]:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We announce that the true rule is that, when an act has been duly signed by the presiding officers of the general assembly, in open session in the senate and house, approved by the governor of the state, and duly deposited in the office of the secretary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the state, it is sufficient evidence, nothing to the contrary appearing upon its face, that it passed the general assembly, and that it is not competent either by the journals of the two houses, or either of them, or by any other evidence, to impeach such an act. And, this being so, it follows that the court is not at liberty to inquire into what the journals of the two houses may show as to the successive steps which may have been taken in the passage of the original bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a casual reading of the foregoing, it would seem that the Governor's signature upon an Act is one of the essentials to the application of the doctrine. However, such cannot be the case because the Enrolled Bill Rule has been applied to vetoed bills. Cf. State ex rel. Coleman v. Lewis, 181 S.C. 10, 186 S.E. 625, and because of this, I have concluded that the Governor's signature is not one of the essentials of the Enrolled Rule Bill. For this reason, references to the necessity of the Governor's signature upon Joint Resolutions proposing amendments to the Constitution, in order to bring them within the Enrolled Bill Rule, are of no real significance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When those writing Article XV of the Constitution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of 1868 and its present counterpart, Article XVI of the Constitution of 1895, omitted therefrom any descriptive reference to the nature of the legislative vehicle to be used in proposing an amendment, it was done advisedly and with full knowledge of the fact that under the Constitution of 1790, the legislative vehicle to purpose the amendment had been specifically designated as a Bill. I have already pointed out that under the Constitution of 1790, Executive assent or approval to legislative Acts was not required. However, with the restoration of the veto, Executive assent or approval, except on matters of adjournment, was required to every Bill or Joint Resolution. Bills and Joint Resolutions are the accepted style of legislative enactments. Consequently, the omission of any designation of the proposing legislative vehicle is highly significant and must mean that those writing the provisions of our last two Constitutions dealing with their amending intended that the Executive should take no part in the amending process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was held in the case of Fleming v. Royall, supra, that a Title to a Joint Resolution proposing a constitutional amendment was not essential. And, in that case, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Court pointed out that in many respects the Legislature in proposing constitutional amendments is not subject to rules controlling ordinary legislative action. Now, the Constitution provides that every Act or Resolution having the force of law shall relate but to one subject, and that shall be expressed in the Title. Section 17, Article III. Consequently, in reaching the conclusion which it did in the Fleming case, supra, the Court recognized the principle, that legislative action in proposing amendments to the Constitution did not fall within the purview of Acts or Joint Resolutions, as those documents are contemplated by other provisions of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that notwithstanding its designation as a &quot;Joint Resolution&quot;, the legislative vehicle here was not a Joint Resolution of the sort referred to in either Section 23, Article IV, or Section 17, Article 3, and that, consequently, the Governor's action on the matter was completely unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A still further and compelling reason leads me to this conclusion. In order for legislative vehicles, proposing joint resolutions, to become effective, they must be voted upon favorably&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by two-thirds of the members elected to each House. This means that 83 members of the House of Representatives must vote favorably upon the proposing vehicle, and, at present, 31 members of the Senate. On the other hand, vetoes may be overriden by two-thirds of a quorum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Smith v. Jennings, supra, it was specifically held that under the Constitution of 1895 2/3 of a quorum may override a veto. This decision cites other South Carolina judicial precedents dealing with the comparable provision of the Constitution of 1868. Now, a quorum of each House is a mere majority. Section 11, Article III. Consequently, it is to be seen that even if the Governor's approval was necessary, his action could be overriden by as few as 43 members of the House (2/3 of 63) and 11 Senators (2/3 of 16). Such a result would be wholly illogical. Accordingly, I conclude, and so hold, that the Governor is not a part of the legislative machinery contemplated by Section 1 of Article XVI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel for the defendants call my attention to the fact that my ruling here is in keeping with an opinion of the Attorney General of the State. While the opinions of the Attorney General are not binding upon the Court, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  they are persuasive, for that official occupies a quasi judicial position and it is gratifying to find that my views are in harmony with his opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As previously pointed out, there is an absence of judicial precedent on this question in this State. However, similar questions have been presented to other Courts in several other jurisdictions, including the Supreme Court of the United States. In every instance that I have found, with but one possible exception, the results reached sustain my views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the course of the argument before the United States Supreme Court in the case of Hollingsworth v. Virginia, 3 Dall. 378, 1 L. Ed. 644, it was argued that the 11th Amendment to the Constitution had not been proposed in due form, for the reason that it had not been presented to the President of the United States for his approval. The Attorney General of the United States, in answer, pointed out that the same course had been pursued relative to the adoption of the 11th amendment as had been pursued in the case of the 10 other Amendments previously adopted. At this point in his oral argument, he was interrupted by Justice Chase of the Supreme Court, who made the following statement: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;There can, surely, be no necessity to answer that argument. The negative of the President applies only to the ordinary cases of legislation. He has nothing to do with the proposition or adoption of amendments to the Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the United States Supreme Court did not deliver a written opinion, it was unanimously ruled on the following day that the 11th Amendment was constitutionally adopted. This case appears to be the one occasion when this question was presented to the United States Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other cases sustaining my views are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People ex rel. Stewart v. Ramer, 62 Colo. 128, 160 P. 1032; Collier v. Gray, 116 Fla. 845, 157 So. 40; State of Louisiana v. American Sugar Refining Co., 137 La. 407, 68 So. 742; Warfield v. Vandiver, 101 Md. 78, 60 A. 538, 4 Am. Cas. 692; Commonwealth ex rel. Elkins v. Griest, 196 Pa. 396, 46 A. 505, 50 L.R.A. 868; State ex rel. Morris v. Mason, 43 La. Ann. 590, 9 So. 776; In re Senate File 31, 25 Neb. 864, 41 N.W. 981; Green v. Weller, 32 Miss. 650; and Keohler v. Hill, 60 Iowa 543, 14 N.W. 738, 15 N.W. 609.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passing comment on some of these appears to be in order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of People ex rel. Stewart&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  v. Ramer, supra, a Resolution of the General Assembly of the State of Colorado had been vetoed by the Governor, and the question was, therefore, squarely before the Supreme Court of that State. The Court held that the veto was inoperative and that the Governor was not a part of the legislative machinery involved in proposing amendments to the Constitution of that State. It appears from the decision of the Court that the Colorado Constitution gave to the Governor the power to veto other legislative matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case of Louisiana v. American Sugar Refining Company, supra, is of considerable interest because the Court took occasion to make reference to the many Constitutions the State of Louisiana seems to have had. In the case before it for decision, it held that the Governor was not required to approve any proposed amendment to the Constitution, calling attention to the fact that under earlier Constitutions the Governor had been given that right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision in Commonwealth ex rel. Elkins v. Griest, supra, was a decision before the Court of last resort of the State of Pennsylvania. An examination of the facts stated in the opinion shows that the Constitution of Pennsylvania&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contained provisions substantially similar to the two provisions in our own Constitution, which I have been discussing. The Court held that the approval of the Governor of Pennsylvania to amendments to the Constitution was not required, pointing out that the only authorities which have any right to assent or dissent to any constitutional amendment were the two Houses of the General Assembly and the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case reported as In re Senate File 31, supra, it had been urged upon the Supreme Court of Nebraska that it had been the long-standing custom to submit to the Executive of that State proposals to amend the Constitution. In answer to that contention, the Nebraska Supreme Court said [25 Neb. 864, 41 N.W. 984]:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Suppose, however, that, through mistake or a superabundance of caution, it is submitted to him, and he approves it, or, as in this case, retains it for more than five days, Sundays excepted, in what way does that affect the Resolution? It is still but a proposition, which has gained nothing from approval of the governor; but, to be of any validity it must be adopted by * * * the electors * * *. Suppose each branch of the legislature, under a mistake as to their&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  duty, should cause the bill or resolution to be read at large on six different days (the Constitution of Nebraska required one reading on three different days), or perform any other act in its passage not required by law, would the bill or resolution, therefore, be void, if the acts done included all that the law requires? No one will so contend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court then stated that there was a material difference between a failure to perform all that the Constitution required and the performance of more than was requisite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the course of its opinion in Warfield v. Vandiver, supra, the Maryland Court, holding that the approval of the Governor was not necessary to a Joint Resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of Maryland, took occasion to point out that [60 A. 541]:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless the express language of the Constitution has unequivocally clothed the Governor with such an authority in relation to proposed constitutional amendments, as is the case in Delaware, but in no other state, it cannot be borrowed from some other provision pertaining to a wholly different subject. Whilst the Governor is intrusted with power to protect the people against hasty legislation, he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is not given a prerogative to guard them against themselves in the matter of amending the organic law. He is not superior to them. It is their will which he must obey; it is not his will which they must subserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like South Carolina, the Maryland Constitution contained a provision requiring executive approval of every Bill passed by the General Assembly of that State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only seeming authority against the proposition to which my attention has been called is the California case of Hatch v. Stoneman, 66 Cal. 632, 6 P. 734. Unfortunately, the volume containing this decision was not available to counsel, and the holding of the California Court has been ascertained from comments made by other Courts, whose decisions were available. While it appears that the Supreme Court of California had held that before the question of amending the Constitution be submitted to the people, the approval of the Governor was required, it would seem that the method required of the California Legislature differed substantially from the method provided for in our Constitution and in other State Constitutions. Two legislative steps appeared necessary. The first was the adoption by the Legislature&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***25]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of California by the requisite vote of the proposed Amendment, and the second was the enactment of a Bill directing that the proposals thus agreed upon be submitted. The decision of the California Court seems to be that the Governor's approval on the Bill submitting the question was essential for the reason that the Bill was similar to other legislative enactments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have earlier, in this opinion, indicated that authorities from other jurisdictions would not be controlling upon the Courts of this State. It is, however, a matter of satisfaction to find that other authorities do sustain the position which I have taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question 2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was this particular Resolution adopted in such a way as to justify the submission of the amendment it proposed to the electors at the election held November 2nd, 1948?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel have argued to me that notwithstanding that it was unnecessary to secure the Governor's approval to the Joint Resolution proposing the Amendment, the Legislature saw fit to make the effective date of the Resolution the occasion that it be approved by the Governor, and since it was presented to the Governor on the day of sine die adjournment, it did not become effective&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***26]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or operative until two days following the convening of the 1949 General Assembly. They have argued that because of this, the act of the Secretary of State in causing the question of the adoption of the Amendment to be submitted in the 1948 General Election was premature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recognize that as a general proposition, the Legislature may designate in the future the date upon which legislative action shall take effect. I have no argument with the soundness of this general rule, but, for the reasons which I shall point out, one Legislature may not make the effective date of a Joint Resolution proposed by it the occasion when a new or subsequent Legislature convenes. The provisions of Section 1, Article 16 of the Constitution, specifically state that if an Amendment be proposed and agreed to it must be submitted at the next general election thereafter for representatives. Furthermore, in order for it to become effective, it must be ratified by the next General Assembly. In other words, the approving action of two succeeding Legislatures is required. Consequently, if the argument advanced by the plaintiff were to be followed, we would have a case where one General Assembly, the 87th, proposed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***27]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the amendment; it became effective upon the convening of the 88th, and would have to be ratified by the 89th. In other words, we would not have the action of two successive General Assemblies upon the amendment. An entirely different General Assembly would intervene. This is counter to the plain mandate in the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is argued to me, however, that a Court cannot restate the language of legislative enactments in order to make it agree with some possible conclusion as to its intention. In support of this contention, they cite the case of Bray v. City Council of Florence, 62 S.C. 57, 39 S.E. 810, 812, wherein our court said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The language declaring the intent of an act is as much beyond our power as the subject to which that declaration relates, and it would violate the principles of law to change the phraseology of a statute to make it conform to the assumed purpose of the lawgiver in any other way than as warranted by the rules of construction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, the proposition propounded by the plaintiff is correct, but it overlooks the fact that it is not only within the power of the Court, but its duty to declare the true legislative intent. One can be left in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***28]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  no doubt as to the legislative intent, if the Resolution as a whole is read. Section 2 directs the question propounded therein be submitted to the qualified electors at the next general election. That could mean but one thing viz., the election of November 2nd, 1948.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been pointed out that it was beyond the power of the General Assembly to,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) require the Governor's approval to the legislative vehicle, proposing the amendment to the Constitution, and,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) That it could not make it effective upon the occasion of the convening of the next General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this reason, the provisions of Section 3 are unconstitutional and of no effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does this destroy the Act in toto? I think not. It is the duty of the Court to sustain the constitutional portions of an Act, when the constitutional part is capable of being severed from the unconstitutional part, so that each part may be read and stand by itself. Gillespie v. Blackwell, 164 S.C. 115, 161 S.E. 869. The situation here falls within that rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When, therefore, did the proposing resolution become effective? The answer is obvious. At such time as was necessary in order to permit the Secretary of State&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***29]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to perform the functions required by law of him in order that the proposal be properly submitted to the people at the election in 1948.  </SPAN></P>

The court reversed because the trial judge lost jurisdiction to pass upon the amount of attorney's fees to be allowed after adjourning court sine die and leaving the circuit where the action was brought. The only issue with reference to attorney's fees heard by the trial judge while holding court where the action was brought was whether or not any fee was allowable. The order made in the other circuit that fixed the amount of the fee contained and constituted new matter not presented to him or marked &quot;heard.&quot; It was in no sense supplemental or germane to the enforcement of the original judgment; therefore, it was void for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Two of the directors, who had never resided in South Carolina but were residents of other states, filed a motion to vacate and set aside the service made under 1947 S.C. Acts 277.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stockholder filed the action on July 14, 1945. The two directors resigned and had ceased to be directors on December 20, 1946. After several unsuccessful attempts of service, the stockholder sought to serve the directors under the provisions of 1947 S.C. Acts 277. The trial court found that the provisions of the Act for substituted service did not apply retrospectively to former directors of a domestic corporation who had ceased to be directors prior to the effective date of the Act, May 19, 1947. On review, the court affirmed, holding that the Act evinced an legislative intent that it should operate prospectively. Under the Act, the Secretary of State was considered as an attorney in fact upon whom process may be served only when certain acts were done by a non-resident after the passage of the Act. A retroactive intent of the legislature would not be assumed, and it was in fact doubtful whether the legislature was empowered to make it so. Further, a statute would not be given retrospective effect unless such a construction was required by the express words of the statute or was necessarily implied from its terms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a taxpayer and qualified elector, brought suit against defendant, members of the county council, to have declared unconstitutional a special election Act, 1948 S.C. Acts 764, providing for a system of municipal government for Charleston County. Plaintiff alleged that the Act was in conflict with various provisions of the Constitution of South Carolina.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The special election Act provided for a system of municipal government, administered by a County Council as the corporate authority, including a delegation of the police power to the Council. The court held that the legislature could not delegate its power to pass a charter governing a city or county to any other body or community. It could, however, draft a charter or optional form of government for municipalities, and make its adoption dependent upon the vote of the locality. Although the word &quot;levy&quot; was not used in the constitution, the authority of the General Assembly to delegate to cities and towns the power to levy taxes was clear. However, there was no more right inherent in a city than in a county to have this power bestowed upon it, and counties were included along with cities and towns. Thus, the court found that the police power could not have been delegated to the corporate authorities of one county and withheld as to all others, especially in view of S.C. Const. art. 8, &sect; 1. The court determined that there was nothing in the Act to justify this classification; thus, that portion of the Act purporting to delegate the police power to the County Council was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court enjoined the county from exercising any of the powers conferred by a certain part of the Act, but in other respects the petition was dismissed. The court held that the Act was constitutional, except that part which purported to delegate the police power to the County Council. When that portion of the Act was eliminated, the remaining Act was capable of execution in accordance with the legislative intent.</SPAN></P>

(S.C.), authorized a county to issue general obligation bonds to finance construction of a war memorial, a health center, and a cattle barn and show ring. The war memorial commission filed an action to determine the constitutionality of the act, i.e., whether it was authorized by Article 10, &sect; 6 of the South Carolina Constitution. This provision prohibited the General Assembly from authorizing a county to issue bonds for any purpose except for education, to build and repair public roads, buildings, and bridges, and for a few other purposes. The court held that the act was invalid insofar as it authorized the issuance of bonds to pay for the war memorial. A war memorial, although serving a public purpose, did not serve a purpose embraced in Article 10, &sect; 6. Further, the proposed memorial, although housing a public library, was not a public building within the meaning of Article 10, &sect; 6, because a large part of its was to have been given over to the American Legion, which was a private organization. The act was valid as to the cattle barn and show ring because that building was intended to serve an educational purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intestate died unmarried, without leaving a father, mother, brother, sister, or any lineal ancestor or descendant. She was survived by the uncle, who was of the whole blood, and numerous first cousins, all children of nine predeceased uncles and aunts of the whole blood. The case was governed by &sect; 8906, Volume 4, Code of Laws 1942, as amended by Act May 14, 1945, No. 194 of the Acts of the South Carolina General Assembly for the year 1945, 44 St. at Large, p. 313. The title of the amendatory Act read: &quot;An Act to Amend Subdivision (6) of &sect; 8906, Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1942, Relating to the Distribution of Intestate Estates, so as to Further Provide for the Distribution of Such Estates.&quot; Subdivision (6), as amended, provided that if an intestate died, leaving no surviving spouse, the estate was to descend in equal parts to the uncles and aunts and that the children of a deceased uncle or aunt were to take among them the share to which their parent would have been entitled had the parent survived the intestate. In affirming the distribution among the uncle and cousins, the court held that the amendment was constitutional and that the legislative intent was plain.</SPAN></P>

Under &sect;&sect; 9 and 19, if the Act increased the compensation to members of the General Assembly, it would be deemed unconstitutional. The court found that the direction that the members be paid official expenses for work during and in between sessions and that such payment could be made without itemization, was a violation of the constitution. It not only increased compensation to the members, it allowed such payment without the itemization required under &sect; 3141, Code of Laws (South Carolina).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal from Common Pleas Circuit Court of Georgetown County; L. D. Lide, Judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding by J. Frank Byrd for an order requiring Charles W. Lawrimore, as Treasurer of Georgetown County, S.C., to perform his alleged official duty by collecting, from the International Paper Company, county taxes claimed to be payable for the years 1942 to 1946 inclusive. From the decree, petitioner appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order of Judge Lide follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J. Frank Byrd, the petitioner herein, a resident, citizen and taxpayer of the County of Georgetown seeks an order from the Court requiring Charles W. Lawrimore, Treasurer of Georgetown County, to perform his alleged official duty as such Treasurer by collecting from International Paper Company county taxes claimed to be payable for the years 1942 to 1946, inclusive, aggregating $ 403,950.53.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although not formally named as a party to the proceeding, petitioner has had the petition and the rule to show cause granted thereon served on International Paper Company as well as on the respondent, Charles W. Lawrimore, Treasurer of Georgetown County. Both the named respondent and International Paper Company have filed a return, and it is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  understood that both of them are before the Court just as if they had been named as respondents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition alleges that International Paper Company is a corporation doing business for gain and special benefit to the owners of its capital stock, that under Article 8, Section 8, of the Constitution it was entitled to claim exemption from all county taxes except for school purposes for the years 1937 to 1941, both inclusive, a period of five years, which exemption was granted, and that it also claims exemption for the years 1942 to 1946, inclusive, an additional period of five years, under a joint resolution of the General Assembly of South Carolina passed in 1937, April 27, Acts 1937, No. 231, 40 St. at Large, p. 356. It is further alleged that the joint resolution of 1937 under which the exemption is claimed is null and void because in conflict with Article I, Sections 17 and 29, Article 8, Section 8, and Article 10, Sections 1, 4 and 5 of the Constitution of South Carolina, and with Section 2835, Code of 1942, and for the further reason that it is so indefinite as to be impossible of administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The return of Charles W. Lawrimore, as Treasurer of Georgetown County, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the return of International Paper Company each denies that it is the duty of the Treasurer of Georgetown County to collect the County taxes from International Paper Company for the years 1942 and 1946, inclusive, referred to in the petition, and in substance alleges that International Paper Company has been properly exempted from the payment of these taxes by the joint resolution of 1937 referred to in the petition and that such resolution was in all respects valid and effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The return of International Paper Company also contends that the proceedings herein are improperly brought in that the State is not made a party.  Runion v. Latimer, 6 S.C. 126, may possibly lend some color to this contention, but the much later case of Milster v. City of Spartanburg, 68 S.C. 26, 46 S.E. 539, seems to hold to the contrary, and this contention of International Paper Company will, therefore, be overruled at this time and given no further consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither return was in any way traversed by the petitioner other than the allegations in each of them to the effect that the location of the plant of International Paper Company in Georgetown County was beneficial to the County. The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  remaining allegations of the returns must, therefore, be accepted as true.  Bryan v. Auditing Board, 94 S.C. 43, 77 S.E. 736; Pendarvis v. City of Orangeburg, 157 S.C. 496, 154 S.E. 756.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although petitioner has not traversed the allegations of the returns other than as above stated, yet he has filed a motion to strike out certain allegations of the returns relating to the inducements leading up to the location of the plant of International Paper Company in Georgetown County and the benefits derived therefrom by the County. This motion is based on the ground that such allegations are irrelevant and redundant. It does not seem, however, that these allegations, in substance all relating to the enhancement of the public interests by the location of the plant in Georgetown County, are entirely without relevancy, and petitioner's motion to strike out will, therefore, be refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The joint resolution under which the exemption is claimed is as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 1. Certain manufacturing enterprises exempt from county taxes, Charleston, Georgetown, and York Counties.--Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina: That any and all manufacturing enterprises&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hereafter locating in either Charleston or Georgetown or York Counties, or any manufacturing enterprise recently located in either one of the said counties, and the plant or plants of which are in process of construction, and the capital stock of which is not less than Three Hundred Thousand ($ 300,000.00) Dollars, be, and the same are hereby, exempt from the payment of county taxes for a period of ten (10) years from this date; in the case of enterprises already located and now under construction, such exemption shall date from the commencement of the work of construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;&sect; 2. All Acts or parts of Acts; Joint Resolutions or parts of Joint Resolutions inconsistent with the purpose of this Joint Resolution be, and the same are, hereby repealed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the faith of the joint resolution of 1937 Southern Kraft Corporation erected and put into operation in Georgetown County a pulp and paper mill with a capacity of 450 tons of paper per day at an original cost of $ 8,140,000, and International Paper Company subsequently succeeded to all property, rights, privileges, powers, franchises and other interests of Southern Kraft Corporation and has expended the further sum of $ 12,330,000&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for additions and improvements to the plant since acquiring it. It is admitted that International Paper Company comes within the terms of the joint resolutions and is entitled to the exemption therein provided for, if it is a valid legislative enactment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not apparent how this joint resolution of 1937 can in any respect be in conflict with Article I, Section 17, of the Constitution providing that private property shall not be taken for private use without the consent of the owner, nor for public use without just compensation being first made therefor, or with Article I, Section 29, providing that the provisions of the Constitution shall be taken to be mandatory and prohibitory, and not merely directory, except where expressly made directory or promissory by its own terms, or with Section 2835, Code of 1942, providing that contracts entered into with intent to evade payment of taxes or in fraud of the tax laws of the State are against public policy. Nor am I able to see anything so indefinite about the joint resolution as to render it impossible of administration. In fact, petitioner's contentions in none of these respects seem to be seriously pressed, and in any event I am&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the opinion that they are without substantial substance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real weight of petitioner's attack upon the validity of the joint resolution under which the tax exemption is claimed is based on these propositions: That the General Assembly has no power to exempt property from County taxes except such as is granted by Article 8, Section 8, or by Article 10, Section 1 or 4, of the Constitution, that the property of International Paper Company does not come within any of the classes of property thereby exempted or permitted to be exempted, and that Article 10, Section 5, is an express mandate requiring the property of International Paper Company to be taxed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Clarke v. South Carolina Public Service Authority, 177 S.C. 427, 181 S.E. 481, 484, in discussing the rules by which the Court must be governed in considering the constitutionality of an act of the Legislature it is said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In determining this question it is to be observed that it is a well-settled rule in South Carolina that: A statute will, if possible, be construed so as to render it valid; that a legislative act will not be declared unconstitutional unless its repugnance to the Constitution is clear and beyond&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reasonable doubt; that every presumption will be made in favor of the constitutionality of a legislative enactment; that it will be declared unconstitutional only when its invalidity appears so clearly as to leave no room for reasonable doubt that it violates some provision of the Constitution; that all reasonable presumptions must be made in favor of the validity of the Act; and that the Constitution of South Carolina is a limitation upon, rather than a grant of, legislative power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in the same case the Court also went on further to say:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The General Assembly has a right to pass such legislation as in its judgment may seem beneficial to the state, and to create such agencies of government as may be necessary to carry out its purpose, unless expressly prohibited by the Constitution. To the Legislature of South Carolina, consisting of the House and Senate, is granted the legislative power by the Constitution of 1895, article 3, &sect; 1, in this broad language: 'The legislative power of this State shall be vested in two distinct branches, the one to be styled the &quot;Senate&quot; and the other the &quot;House of Representatives,&quot; and both together the &quot;General Assembly of the State of South&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Carolina.&quot;'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our courts have held that by the use of this language the people of the state vested the General Assembly with the entire legislative power of the state, subject only to such restrictions upon and regulations of such power as were contained in the Constitution itself. It is the theory and intent of the Constitution of South Carolina that the powers vested in the General Assembly include all powers not specifically reserved by the Constitution. Massey v. Glenn, 106 S.C. 53, 90 S.E. 321; State v. City Council of Aiken, 42 S.C. 222, 20 S.E. 221, 26 L.R.A. 345; Mauldin v. City Council of Greenville, 42 S.C. 293, 20 S.E. 842, 27 L.R.A. 284, 46 Am. St. Rep. 723; Cathcart v. City of Columbia, 170 S.C. 362, 170 S.E. 435.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is well declared by Mr. Justice Stabler, now Chief Justice, in the case of Park v. Greenwood County, 174 S.C. 35, 176 S.E. 870, 871, in the following language: 'In the recent case of Heslep v. State Highway Department, 171 S.C. 186, 171 S.E. 913, 915, the opinion was closed with this observation, pertinent here: &quot;It has always been, and is now, the law that the General Assembly may enact any act it desires to pass, if such legislation is not expressly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prohibited by the Constitution of this state or the Constitution of the United States. We find nothing in either of the Constitutions which prohibited the enactment of the law attacked in this case.&quot;'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The general statement of the rule is that the powers of the General Assembly are plenary as to all matters of legislation unless limited by some provision of the Constitution. Waterloo School Dist. v. School District, 106 S.C. 292, 91 S.E. 257; State v. Gossett, 117 S.C. 76, 108 S.E. 290, 16 A.L.R. 1299; Walpole v. Wall, 153 S.C. 106, 149 S.E. 760.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The position of petitioner in relation to Article 8, Section 8, of the Constitution is that the specific exemptions therein contained exclude all other exemptions. I do not think that this position can be sustained, if as said in Clarke v. South Carolina Public Service Authority, supra, the Constitution vested &quot;the General Assembly with the entire legislative power of the state, subject only to such restrictions upon and regulations of such power as were contained in the Constitution itself,&quot; and if the theory and intent of the Constitution is &quot;that the powers vested in the General Assembly include all powers not specifically reserved&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 8, Section 8, as originally adopted only contained the following: &quot;Cities and towns may exempt from taxation, by general or special ordinance, except for school purposes, manufactories established within their limits for five consecutive years from the time of the establishment of such manufactories: Provided, That such ordinance shall be first ratified by a majority of such qualified electors of such city or town as shall vote at an election held for that purpose.&quot; There is certainly nothing in this prohibiting the exemption of manufacturing establishments from county taxes for a reasonable period of time, and in so far as Article 8, Section 8, as originally adopted was concerned there was no reason why the General Assembly could not exempt manufacturing establishments from county taxes. It is, therefore, evident that all the subsequent amendments to Article 8, Section 8, authorizing the General Assembly to grant exemptions were entirely superfluous, because the General Assembly already had the power, and the erroneous opinion that it was necessary to adopt these amendments in order to give any power obviously could not take away the power that already&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  existed, particularly when the right to make such exemptions was elsewhere expressly recognized by Article 10, Section 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relevant parts of Article 10, Sections 1, 4 and 5, invoked by petitioner in his attack upon the joint resolution of 1937 are as follows: for a uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 1. &quot;The General Assembly shall provide by law and shall prescribe regulations to secure a just valuation for taxation of all property, real, personal and possessory, except mines and mining claims, the products of which alone shall be taxed; and also excepting such property as may be exempted by law for municipal, educational, literary, scientific, religious or charitable purposes * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 4. &quot;There shall be exempted from taxation all County, township and municipal property used exclusively for public purposes and not for revenue, and the property of all schools, colleges and institutions of learning, all charitable institutions in the nature of asylums for the infirm, deaf and dumb, blind, idiotic and indigent persons, except where the profits of such institutions are applied to private uses; all public libraries, churches, parsonages and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  burying grounds; but property of associations and societies, although connected with charitable objects, shall not be exempt from State, County or municipal taxation * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 5. &quot;The corporate authorities of counties, townships, school districts, cities, towns and villages may be vested with power to assess and collect taxes for corporate purposes; such taxes to be uniform in respect to persons and property within the jurisdiction of the body imposing the same. * * * And the General Assembly shall require that all the property, except that herein permitted to be exempted within the limits of municipal corporations, shall be taxed for corporate purposes and for the payment of debts contracted under authority of law. * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be observed that Section 1 requires the General Assembly to provide by law for a uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation of all property, except mines and mining claims, the products of which alone are to be taxed, and also except such property as may be exempted by law for municipal, educational, literary, scientific, religious or charitable purposes. From this it is apparent that the right of the General Assembly to make laws exempting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  property from taxation for municipal, educational, literary, scientific, religious or charitable purposes is expressly recognized by the Constitution itself, and if the exemption in this case is for any of these purposes it seems clear that the validity of the joint resolution of 1937 cannot be questioned. The exemption of the property described in Section 4 is made mandatory, and the General Assembly of course has no power to tax it at all, but this plainly does not prohibit the General Assembly from exercising its expressly conferred right to make laws exempting other property for the purposes stated in Section 1. Section 1 makes no mandatory exemption as to any particular class of property except mines and mining claims, leaving it to the Legislature to make exemptions by law for municipal, educational, literary, scientific, religious or charitable purposes. It is, therefore, necessary to inquire if the exemption under the joint resolution of 1937 is for a municipal purpose, it being readily apparent that it is not for an educational, literary, scientific, religious or charitable purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem thus presented has been so clearly and definitely answered adversely to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contentions of petitioner in Duke Power Company v. Bell, County Treas., 156 S.C. 299, 152 S.E. 865, 870, that it would seem only necessary to refer to that case, but it is so conclusive of the questions with which we are now concerned that extensive quotations therefrom seem justified. The exemption there claimed was under a joint resolution approved March 5, 1925, 34 Stat. at Large, 891, exempting manufactories desiring to locate in Lancaster and certain other counties from all county taxes except for school purposes for the period of five years from their establishment, and in the course of its consideration of the validity of the joint resolution, after setting forth the provisions of Article 10, Section 1, the Court said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That under this provision of the Constitution the power to exempt property from taxation for 'municipal' and certain other named purposes is expressly reserved to the lawmaking department of the Government is entirely clear. The exception written into this section of the Constitution, reserving to the General Assembly the power to exempt property from taxation for certain purposes, is as much a part of the fundamental law as the provision requiring the General&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Assembly to provide for a uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation 'of all property.' Our chief concern here, therefore, is with the proper construction and interpretation of the words municipal purposes as here used. In 42 C. J., p. 214, the term municipal purposes is thus defined:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Municipal Purposes. A term without any definite technical import, defined as a public or governmental purpose, as distinguished from a private purpose; a purpose intended to embrace some of the functions of the government, local or general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The word municipal, as used in another section of the Constitution, to wit, section 11, art. 7, providing that the General Assembly 'may make special provision for municipal government,' etc., has been held by our court to refer to and embrace the governmental affairs of counties.  State v. Touchberry et al., 121 S.C. 5, 113 S.E. 345; [Carolina]&nbsp;Grocery Co. v. Burnet, 61 S.C. [205] 213, 214, 39 S.E. 381, 58 L.R.A. 687; Carroll v. York, 109 S.C. 1, 95 S.E. 121. Fortunately, however, the particular language of this section here under consideration has been very fully construed and interpreted by our Supreme Court in the case of Chester County v.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  White Bros. 70 S.C. 433, 50 S.E. 28, 32. In that case the precise question involved was whether the General Assembly could exempt from State, county, and municipal taxes the bonds of a county in the hands of a purchaser. The Circuit Court (Judge Gage) held that such exemption was prohibited by sections 1 and 4 of article 10. The Supreme Court speaking through Mr. Justice Jones, in an exceedingly clear and able opinion, said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'The fundamental error of the circuit court is in holding that the phrase &quot;municipal purposes,&quot; used in section 1, in conjunction with property, means the same thing as &quot;municipal property,&quot; used in section 4, and that the exemption might have been omitted from section 1, or section 4 might have been omitted altogether, and the same meaning accomplished as is compassed by the two sections. This method of construction violates the rule which requires that the language of a constitution should receive a natural and reasonable construction, and that different portions thereof should, if possible, receive a construction which would give some meaning to each of such provisions. The construction by the circuit court would strike from the constitution the provision&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in section 1, &quot;and also excepting such property as may be exempted by law for municipal, educational, literary, scientific, religious or charitable purposes.&quot; The phrase, &quot;as may be exempted by law,&quot; does not simply mean, &quot;as may be exempted by section 4, art. 10, of the Constitution,&quot; but clearly includes such exemption as the Legislature may lawfully make for the purposes named. This provision of the Constitution implies that the Legislature has the power to exempt property from taxation for municipal or other specified purposes, provided the exemption is not expressly or impliedly prohibited by other portions of the Constitution. It is a well-established principle that the Legislature has all the power not denied it by the Constitution expressly or by necessary implication. Section 4, art. 10, is mandatory, and is self-executing, so that further legislation would not be necessary to exempt from taxation all property falling within the specified classes, and the Legislature would have no power to tax what is therein exempt. But this section, in so far as it exempts property, is not a limitation on the power of the Legislature to make further exemptions falling within the exceptions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contained in section 1. Section 4 declares that the specified property shall be exempt, while section 1 permits legislative discretion in exempting other property not named in section 4, provided the exemption is for municipal purposes or other purposes named. The Constitution does not require that all property shall be taxed, but it only requires that all property not exempt under the Constitution, and not exempt by a valid act of the Legislature, shall be taxed. So that, whenever the right of the Legislature to exempt property from taxation is disputed, the question is whether such exemption is expressly or impliedly forbidden by the Constitution. If the exemption falls within the classes named in section 4, we need go no further. If the exemption does not fall within section 4, then we may inquire if it falls within the legislative discretion to make exemptions, implied in section 1. * * *'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court then further went on to say:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under the foregoing decision it is not open to question, I think, that the term municipal purposes as used in this section of the Constitution is the equivalent of, or fairly embraces, county purposes; that is, an exemption for county purposes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is an exemption for municipal purposes if within the scope of the legitimate governmental purposes of a county for which the Legislature may provide by law. If so, our sole remaining inquiry is whether the exemption granted by this Statute is an exemption granted for a legitimate governmental purpose of the County of Lancaster. Since, in the absence of constitutional restriction, the power of the Legislature to exempt from taxation is as broad as its power to tax, and since under this provision of Section 1, Article X, the power of the Legislature to exempt from taxation for municipal purposes is expressly reserved, the Legislature's discretionary power to determine what is a municipal or county purpose is as broad as its discretionary power to determine any question of legislative or governmental policy. That it is within the legislative power to exempt from taxation manufactories, or manufacturing enterprises, as a matter of public or governmental policy, is well settled. At the time of the adoption of our Constitution of 1895, the policy of exempting property used in a manufacturing industry was more or less common among the States of the American Union, See 26 R. C. L., 328, &sect;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  287. It was, indeed, a policy recognized and expressly approved and sanctioned in our fundamental law (section 8, art. 8, Constitution of 1895). The rationale of that policy is very well stated by the Rhode Island Court in the case of Crafts v. Ray, 22 R. I. 179, 46 A. 1043, 1045, 49 L.R.A. 604, holding that an exemption from taxation for ten (10) years of two private corporations on condition that they locate manufacturing property in a town was not unconstitutional. It is a matter of common knowledge that during the past quarter of a century many of the towns and cities of this State have availed themselves of the self-executing provision (section 8, art. 8) of the Constitution of 1895 and exempted manufacturing enterprises from taxation. It is also a matter of common knowledge that within the past few years the pressure of economic conditions which made it desirable for towns and cities to encourage the investment of capital in manufacturing enterprises by exempting such property from taxation for a limited period has extended to and become equally as exigent for counties and even for the States themselves. Ours is distinctively an industrial age, and the prosperity of counties&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and of states, as well as of cities and towns, is becoming increasingly dependent upon the opportunity afforded their people for employment in manufacturing industries and upon the taxable value of property devoted to and used in manufacturing enterprises. The conditions are keenly competitive, and it is not surprising that within the past few years a large number of the counties of this state have sought and received authority from the Legislature to exempt manufactories located within their borders from county taxes for a limited period of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That the municipal purpose, from the standpoint of a county, subserved by the exemption from taxation for a limited period of years of a manufactory located or constructed within the county is not essentially different from that subserved by the exemption from taxation of county bonds in the hands of purchasers ( Chester County v. White, supra), would seem to be apparent. The ultimate object of exemption in either case is to promote the interests and to lighten the burden of the taxpayers of the county. * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there is ample basis in reason for the adoption of such a legislative policy. If so, it follows that the exemption&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of 'manufactories' from county taxation for a limited period of years is a 'municipal' purpose within the power reserved to the General Assembly by this section of the Constitution. At all events, in view of the foregoing considerations, I am far from being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the exemption granted by this statute was not for a 'municipal' purpose within the meaning of the constitutional provision. Defendant's contention in that regard must, therefore, be overruled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Duke Power Company case is also conclusive against petitioner's contention to the effect that Article 10, Section 5, is an express mandate requiring the General Assembly to tax the property of International Paper Company and others similarly situated. In that case the Court had the following to say in connection with the effect of Article 10, Section 5:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) Section 5, art. 10, of the State Constitution of 1895. This section provides that taxes shall 'be uniform in respect to persons and property within the jurisdiction of the body imposing the same,' and that the 'General Assembly shall require that all the property, except that herein permitted to be exempted within the limits of municipal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  corporations, shall be taxed for corporate purposes,' etc. The equality and uniformity clause of this section is, in substance, exactly the same as that contained in section 1, except that it is directed and applied to taxation by and within a taxing subdivision of the State. In this section as in section 1, property 'herein permitted to be exempted,' etc., is expressly excepted. The word 'Herein,' as is clearly disclosed by the context, embraces the whole of article 10, if not the whole of the Constitution itself. If, as we have seen, the exemption here in question is for a municipal purpose within the meaning of the exception or reservation contained in section 1, it follows, of course, that it is not prohibited by this section 5 of article 10.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authority of the Duke Power Company case has never been questioned, and to the contrary it has been repeatedly recognized by the Supreme Court as binding authority.  Clarke v. South Carolina Public Service Authority et al., 177 S.C. 427, 181 S.E. 481; Ellerbe v. David, 193 S.C. 332, 8 S.E.2d 518; Trustees of Wofford College v. City of Spartanburg, 201 S.C. 315, 23 S.E.2d 9. Unless it is to be overruled the petition in this case will&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***25]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  necessarily have to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner suggests that the Duke Power Company case is not controlling in this case for the reason that the property involved in the Duke case was an electric power plant and that Duke Power Company was a public utility. It is evident, however, that this is not a valid distinction, because the property of Duke Power Company, even though devoted to the service of the public, nevertheless remained private property just the same as that of International Paper Company. Moore v. Columbia &amp; G. R. Company, 38 S.C. 1, 16 S.E. 781; Mays v. Seaboard Air Line Ry. 75 S.C. 455, 56 S.E. 30; Savannah Bldg. Supply Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 85 S.C. 405, 67 S.E. 1135.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps reference should be made to some of the cases chiefly relied upon by petitioner, all of which have been duly considered and are not thought either to require or to justify any conclusion contrary to that reached by the Court in the Duke Power Company case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner refers to a statement contained in the opinion of Mr. Chief Justice McIver in Germania Sav. Bank v. Town of Darlington, 50 S.C. 337, 27 S.E. 846, 859, to the effect that if the General Assembly had undertaken&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***26]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to exempt the property of Darlington Manufacturing Company from taxation, the effort would have been futile, because in violation of the Constitution; but Judge McIver went on further to say: &quot;But, in addition to this, the general assembly has not undertaken to exempt any of the property of the company from taxation.&quot; It is thus quite apparent that the statement of Judge McIver relied upon by petitioner was wholly obiter dictum, and in addition to this the other members of the Court concurred in the result only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attempted tax exemptions held to be invalid in Garrison v. City of Laurens, 54 S.C. 449, 32 S.E. 696, and Milster v. City of Spartanburg, 68 S.C. 26, 46 S.E. 539, were both made by city ordinances alone and while the Constitution of 1868 was in effect. Since a city or town has such powers only as are granted in express words or such as are necessarily or fairly implied from or are incident to the powers expressly granted ( Luther v. Wheeler, 73 S.C. 83, 52 S.E. 874, 4 L.R.A., N. S., 746, 6 Ann. Cas. 754), naturally the Court was required to hold that the ordinances were invalid and void. As the Court said in the Milster case [68 S.C. 26, 46 S.E. 542]:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The effort&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***27]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to bind the city amounts to no more than if the council had undertaken to legislate or make contracts for another municipality or for the entire state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Feldman &amp; Co. v. City Council of Charleston, 23 S.C. 57, 55 Am. Rep. 6, an exemption from taxation was not involved at all, but the question before the Court was the validity of an act of the General Assembly authorizing the City of Charleston to issue bonds to assist private individuals in carrying out private enterprises. The Court held that the bonds were invalid, since the power to issue the bonds necessarily implied the power to levy taxes to provide for their payment, and that the Legislature had no power to authorize the levy of taxes to assist private individuals in carrying out private enterprises. It is readily apparent that the question involved in the Feldman case was very different from the question with which we are concerned in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Ellerbe v. David, Co. Treas., 193 S.C. 332, 8 S.E.2d 518, involved the validity of two joint resolutions of the General Assembly passed in 1938, 40 Stat. at Large, pp. 2630, and 2631, providing for the relief of certain taxpayers in certain school districts of Marlboro&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***28]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  County who had suffered damage from hail in the year 1937. Under these resolutions the County Treasurer was authorized to borrow sufficient money to refund the 1937 taxes which had been paid by the hail sufferers, and provision was made for the levy and collection of taxes for the repayment of the loan. It will be noted that this involved the collection of taxes to repay a loan used wholly for the benefit of certain private individuals, although there were citizens and taxpayers of the County in other school districts who suffered hail storm damage and for whom no relief was provided. The Court held the resolutions invalid, but the authority of the Duke Power Company case was in no respect questioned, and to the contrary was distinguished and in effect reaffirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Gentry v. Taylor et al., 192 S.C. 145, 5 S.E.2d 857, 858, involved the validity of an Act of the Legislature authorizing the County of Spartanburg to issue bonds, and to levy a tax for their payment, to aid in enlarging an airport in the City of Spartanburg. It was held that the act violated Article 10, Section 6, of the Constitution providing: &quot;The General Assembly shall not have power to authorize any county or township&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***29]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to levy a tax or issue bonds for any purpose except for educational purposes, to build and repair public roads, buildings and bridges, to maintain and support prisoners, pay jurors, county officers, and for litigation, quarantine and court expenses, and for ordinary county purposes, to support paupers, and pay past indebtedness.&quot; The construction of an airport quite plainly not fitting any of the other purposes stated in this provision of the Constitution, the only question to be determined was whether it was an ordinary county purpose. It was held that the construction of an airport was not an ordinary county purpose, and that the act consequently violated Article 10, Section 6, of the Constitution. The distinction between that case and the one now before the Court is obvious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Doran et al. v. Robertson et al., 203 S.C. 434, 27 S.E.2d 714, was a proceeding to enjoin the issuance of county bonds in compliance with a contract between the Board of County Commissioners of Charleston County and a private corporation for the construction of dwellings for war workers and the use of the proceeds of the bonds for the construction of sewers in rural communities. Following Gentry v. Taylor, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***30]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  supra, it was held that the issuance of these bonds not being for an ordinary county purpose, it was expressly forbidden by Article 10, Section 6, of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Parrott v. Gourdin, 205 S.C. 364, 32 S.E.2d 14, involved the validity of an act authorizing Williamsburg County to issue notes and levy a tax for their payment for the purpose of acquiring land for the construction of an airport. Again following Gentry v. Taylor, supra, it was held that the construction of an airport not being an ordinary county purpose the act violated Article 10, Section 6, of the Constitution. In connection with this case it may be properly noticed, however, that an amendment to the Constitution was adopted in 1945, see Acts 1945, p. 11, authorizing counties or townships to levy a tax and issue bonds for the construction and maintaining of airports or landing strips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the cases arising under Article 10, Section 6, of the Constitution are wholly foreign to the subject involved in this case is clearly indicated by Benjamin v. Housing Authority of Darlington County, 198 S.C. 79, 15 S.E.2d 737, 739. It was held in that case that the property of the housing authority might properly be exempted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***31]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from taxation, but the Court further said: &quot;Of course, if the County of Darlington were responsible for the payment of any portion of the contemplated bond issue, or if it were in contemplation that a tax be levied on property in said County to pay any portion of the cost or maintenance of this project, it would be in violation of Article X, Section 6 of the Constitution. See Gentry v. Taylor et al., 192 S.C. 145, 5 S.E.2d 857.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would scarcely seem necessary to point out that the cases of Trustees of Wofford College v. City of Spartanburg et al., 201 S.C. 315, 23 S.E.2d 9; Converse College v. City of Spartanburg et al., 201 S.C. 335, 23 S.E.2d 16, and Trustees of Wofford College and Converse College v. Burnett et al., 209 S.C. 92, 39 S.E.2d 155, have no application to the questions involved in the present case. In those cases the question was whether certain lands of the colleges were exempt from taxation under Article 10, Section 4, of the Constitution exempting from taxation certain property of schools, colleges and institutions of learning. The lands involved not being buildings and premises actually occupied by the colleges, it was held that their exemption from taxation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***32]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was expressly forbidden by the following provision of Article 10, Section 4: &quot;Provided, That as to real estate this exemption shall not extend beyond the buildings and premises actually occupied by such schools, colleges, institutions of learning, asylums, libraries, churches, parsonages and burial grounds, although connected with charitable objects.&quot; The Court in no respect questioned the authority of Duke Power Company v. Bell, supra, but distinguished it on the ground that in the college cases there was an express prohibition, while such was not the case in the Duke Power Company case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being satisfied after careful consideration that the joint resolution of the General Assembly granting the exemption claimed by International Paper Company is not in conflict with any provision of the Constitution, and that it is in all respects a valid enactment, it is ordered, that the petition herein be, and hereby is, dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the child's mother died, the father gave the child to the adoptive parents, who were a deaf mute couple without children of their own. After his discharge and return from service in the United States Navy, the father filed a petition to deprive the adoptive parents of custody of the child, alleging that she was neglected and under improper and insufficient control. After the children's court found that it would be in the best interest of the child if custody was not returned to the adoptive parents, they filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. The proceedings on certiorari were transferred to the court of common pleas, which opined that it was for the best interest of the child that the judgment of the children's court be sustained. In their brief, the adoptive parents raised for the first time the question of the jurisdiction of the children's court, and challenged the constitutionality of the statutes that created that court. Affirming, the court held in part that the constitutional questions were nowhere raised in the lower courts, so far as the record disclosed, and were clearly not available on appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the General Sessions Circuit Court of Cherokee County (South Carolina) convicted defendant of armed robbery, and he was sentenced to a term of 25 years. He appealed, claiming that the trial court's sentence was unreasonable and that the trial court had abused its discretion in imposing that sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a companion robbed a store. The companion held a gun on the clerk at all times, and the clerk was locked in the vault under a promise that someone would be notified that he was there. A passerby became suspicious and on entering the store, heard a noise in the vault and rescued the clerk. Defendant's companion was never found. At trial, defendant claimed that he participated out of fear of the gun that his companion held. The trial judge referred to defendant's &quot;cock and bull&quot; story and said that they had gone there to take a life. On review, the court was unable to say that the trial judge abused the discretion that he had under &sect; 1140, subsection 1 of the South Carolina robbery statute to sentence defendant to 25 years for the crime. The court noted that defendant had a criminal record, that neither defendant or his companion notified anyone about the clerk in the vault, and that the clerk could have died. The court also explained that if a statute fixing a punishment was not unconstitutional, a sentence with the statutory limits was not cruel and unusual punishment. The court also concluded that no prejudice or partiality had motivated the trial judge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action by Frank S. Hay, C. Norwood Hastie, P. L. Bootle, Coastal Terminals, Inc., a corporation, Josie Stewart, W. R. Patrick, Charles E. Gibson, Charles E. Gibson, Inc., a corporation, and certain interveners too numerous to be named, against William J. Leonard, as County Treasurer of Charleston County, and Gedney M. Howe, Jr., as Solicitor of the Ninth Judicial Circuit, to restrain the enforcement of a statute levying an annual license tax for privilege of engaging in business in county of Charleston except in city of Charleston. From an adverse judgment, plaintiffs appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Order of Judge Eatmon follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The above entitled action was instituted to challenge the validity and restrain the enforcement of an Act of the General Assembly of South Carolina passed at the 1947 Session, 45 St. at Large, p. 589. The defendants in the cause are the County Treasurer of Charleston County, to whom the tax is payable by the terms thereof, and the Circuit Solicitor of the Ninth Judicial Circuit, as the prosecuting officer in Charleston County. The Act in question was approved May 19, 1947, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under the same there was levied an annual license tax for the privilege of engaging in each and every business and occupation in the County of Charleston, except in the City of Charleston, which comprises School District No. 20 of said County. This tax is graduated as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On not exceeding the first Five Thousand ($ 5,000.00) Dollars of annual gross receipts therefrom, the sum of Twenty ($ 20.00) Dollars;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the excess over Five Thousand ($ 5,000.00) Dollars to Thirty Thousand ($ 30,000.00) Dollars of annual gross receipts therefrom, an amount of money equal to one-fourth (1/4) of one (1%) per cent thereof;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the excess over Thirty Thousand ($ 30,000.00) Dollars to One Hundred Thousand ($ 100,000.00) Dollars of annual gross receipts therefrom, an amount of money equal to one-sixth (1/6) of one (1%) per cent thereof;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the excess over One Hundred Thousand ($ 100,000.00) Dollars to Two Hundred Thousand ($ 200,000.00) Dollars of annual gross receipts therefrom, an amount of money equal to one-eighth (1/8) of one (1%) per cent thereof;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the excess over Two Hundred Thousand ($ 200,000.00) Dollars of annual gross receipts therefrom, an amount of money&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  equal to one twenty-fifth (1/25) of one (1%) per cent thereof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act requires each taxpayer to file with the County Treasurer of Charleston County on or before each July 15th, commencing with July 15, 1947, a statement under oath showing his gross receipts for the preceding fiscal year, and to pay a tentative tax calculated on the basis of such statement. A like statement must be filed on or before the following July 15th on the basis of which the tentative tax is reconciled with the actual tax due, by rebate or additional payment, and the tentative tax for the ensuing fiscal year is paid, with reconciliation in similar manner at the end of such fiscal year. A taxpayer commencing any business or occupation in a fiscal year must estimate his gross receipts for such year, and pay a tentative tax on the basis thereof, subject to like reconciliation at the end of the fiscal year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 6 of the Act provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The County Treasurer shall place to the credit of the Trustees of each school district the amount of the license fees collected by him under this Act in such district, and the same shall be expended by such Trustees for educational purposes within the District. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Where a license fee covers the engaging in a business or occupation in more than one such school district the said license fee shall be prorated among such school districts on the basis of annual gross receipts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no penalties for late payment, but willful misstatement of gross receipts in an application for a license, as well as engaging in a business or occupation without first having obtained a license so to do, are subject to criminal prosecution and punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the plaintiffs here is a distributor of petroleum products with a place of business in the County of Charleston outside of the City. He alleges that his gross receipts are derived partly from deliveries in that portion of Charleston County in which the Act is applicable, and partly from deliveries made in the City, in which the Act is not applicable, by its express terms. When credit is extended, collection is made for him in Columbia, S.C., by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another plaintiff operates a floral nursery and an exhibition garden in the portion of Charleston County in which the Act is applicable. He alleges that he sells a large part of his output of plants and shrubs&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in interstate commerce, in the course of which they are shipped to places outside the State. He also alleges that the admissions charged by him to his exhibition garden are already subject to the State admissions tax, and that the tax levied by the Act in question constitutes a second license tax on the same gross receipts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third plaintiff conducts a road-side restaurant and a tourists' home in that portion of the County in which the Act is applicable. His contention is that he is subject to the tax while his competitors in the City are not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fourth plaintiff maintains deep water terminals in that portion of the County in which the Act is applicable, and offers its services in the handling of bulk petroleum products to various dealers in such products. Such products move through its terminals into other states, into other counties in this State, and into the City of Charleston, as well as into that portion of the County in which the Act is applicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fifth plaintiff resides in that portion of the County in which the Act is applicable, but engages in her occupation entirely in the City, in which the Act is not applicable by its express terms. In the argument before&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  me it was indicated that this plaintiff works for wages, and is not engaged in an occupation with gross receipts, overhead and expenses and net receipts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sixth plaintiff is engaged in the wholesale distribution of confectioneries and tobaccos, with his place of business in the City of Charleston. He makes sales and deliveries in the portion of the County in which the Act is applicable, and some of the collections for such sales are made at his place of business in the City. He alleges that the merchandise sold by him is already subject to State and Federal excise taxes and that not only is the tax in question a third tax on such merchandise, but also that it constitutes a tax upon such taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A seventh plaintiff is a truck farmer in that portion of the County of Charleston in which the Act is applicable. He markets his produce through the medium of the eighth plaintiff, which is a corporation engaged in the business of supplying farmers with merchandise and also of distributing and selling the products of their farming operations. Almost all of such sales are made by the corporation to purchasers in other states and in Canada. It is alleged that the tax in question will&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fall on the gross amount of the sales made by the corporation for the farmers and also on the amount paid over by the corporation to the farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several of the plaintiffs allege that the Act in question will cause them to make a complete change in their method of keeping their books and accounts, which will involve more than a nominal expenditure by them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The specific points of attack upon the Act are briefly:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) That it violates Article I, section 5, of the State Constitution, and also Article 14 of the Amendments to the United States Constitution, and that it is a denial of equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) That it violates Article I, section 6, of the State Constitution in that the tax is imposed on gross income from property owned by one or more plaintiffs, and hence constitutes a tax on such property which is not in proportion to its value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) That it violates Article III, section 34, of the State Constitution, in that it is a special law where a general law may be made applicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) That it violates Article X, Section 1, of the State Constitution, in that it does not provide for a uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation, and is not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  within any of the exceptions in that section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) That it violates Article X Section 5, of the State Constitution, in that it vests the corporate authorities of the County of Charleston with power to assess and collect taxes for the corporate purposes of the said County without making such taxes uniform in respect to all persons and property within the jurisdiction of the County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) That it violates Article I, section 8, of the United States Constitution, insofar as it undertakes to impose a tax on interstate commerce done in the portion of the County of Charleston in which the Act is applicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Complaint also alleges that the plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law under section 2807 et seq. of the Code of Laws of 1942, first, because the tax in question is not one within the scope of those sections, and secondly, because those sections do not provide for the recovery of interest on taxes paid under protest, and hence the plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the loss of interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the time of answering, the defendants gave notice of Separate Demurrers before me, as the Judge of a Circuit adjoining the Circuit in which the County of Charleston&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lies, there being then and now no regular or special Judge in that Circuit. The matter has been argued fully before me by very able counsel for the parties. The grounds of the Demurrers are substantially the same, and they will be considered together, although such grounds are not herein set forth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act involved here is a taxing statute, and as such it is to be construed and interpreted in the light of certain fundamental principles of constitutional law and established rules of constitutional and statutory construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except as limited by the State and Federal Constitutions, the taxing power of the State is general, and absolute and extends to all persons, property, and business within its jurisdiction or reach.  Santee Mills v. Query, 122 S.C. 158, 115 S.E. 202, 203; Fuller v. South Carolina Tax Commission, 128 S.C. 14, 121 S.E. 478; Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U.S. 37, 40 S. Ct. 221, 64 L. Ed. 445.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Within those limits the necessity, utility, and expediency of legislation are for the determination of the Legislature alone. Every presumption must be indulged in favor of the constitutionality of an act of the Legislature, and to justify a court in pronouncing legislation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unconstitutional, the case must be so clear as to be free from doubt and the conflict of the statute with the Constitution must be irreconcilable. Ordinarily, to doubt the constitutionality of the law is to resolve the doubt in favor of its validity * * *.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where the question is whether a state taxing law contravenes constitutional rights 'the decision must depend, not upon any mere question of form, construction, or definition, but upon the practical operation and effect of the tax imposed.' Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U.S. 37, 40 S. Ct. 221, 64 L. Ed. 445.&quot; Santee Mills v. Query, supra [122 S.C. 158, 115 S.E. 203]. See also American Mfg. Co. of St. Louis, 250 U.S. 459, 39 S. Ct. 522, 63 L. Ed. 1084.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While a tax statute is to be reasonably construed as a whole with the view of carrying out its purpose and intent ( Scottish U. &amp; N. Ins. Co. v. Bowland, 196 U.S. 611, 25 S. Ct. 345, 49 L. Ed. 619; Santee Mills v. Query, 122 S.C. 158, 115 S.E. 202), where the language relied upon to bring the particular person or subject within the law is ambiguous or is reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that would exclude the person or subject sought to be taxed, the well-established&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  general rule requires that any substantial doubt should be resolved against the government and in favor of the taxpayer ( United States v. Merriam [263 U.S. 179], 44 S. Ct. 69, 68 L. Ed. 240 [29 A.L.R. 1547]).&quot; Fuller v. South Carolina Tax Commission, supra [128 S.C. 14, 121 S.E. 481]; cf.  Jack Ulmer, Inc., v. Daniel, Atty. Gen., 193 S.C. 193, 7 S.E.2d 829, 832.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act under consideration imposes an occupation tax, and the value of the privilege extended is measured by the gross receipts of the particular business or occupation engaged in. Since gross receipts constitute the basis of the application of the tax, it would seem clear that, construed strictly, the Act does not apply to those who work for wages or salary, but only to those in business for themselves, so to speak, who have gross receipts, expenses and overhead, and net receipts from their endeavors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs view the Act as imposing a gross income tax which is not levied on a statewide basis, but on the contrary, is confined in its operation to a single county, and actually to only a portion of that County. In my opinion, however, the correct view is that it levies an occupation license tax as a school&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  district tax, imposed in each school district of Charleston County except the school district comprising the City of Charleston, known as School District No. 20 of said County. Its proceeds are to be placed to the credit of the trustees of the school district in which the same are collected, and provision is made for prorating between school districts on the basis of gross receipts any tax collected from a taxpayer engaging in a business or occupation in more than one school district. Such proceeds are to be used by such trustees for educational purposes within the several school districts. While the tax is to be collected by the County Treasurer of Charleston County, it is clear, from section 2776 of the Code of 1942, and from many other constitutional and statutory provisions, that the County Treasurer acts as the treasurer for each school district within the County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs argue that the Act has a large extraterritorial effect, in that, according to their interpretation, gross receipts from business done within the state but outside that portion of Charleston County in which the Act is applicable must be taken into consideration in graduating the amount to be paid by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  each taxpayer coming within the purview of the Act, as well as his gross receipts from business done in other states, and even in foreign countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants do not contend for so broad a construction. They point out that the tax is for the privilege of engaging in business or in an occupation in a limited area, and that it is graduated according to the gross receipts &quot;therefrom&quot;, i. e., from the business done in that area. They recognize the limitations imposed on the power of the state in such decisions as Gwin, White &amp; Prince v. Henneford, 305 U.S. 434, 59 S. Ct. 325, 83 L. Ed. 272; Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U.S. 249, 67 S. Ct. 274; and Joseph v. Carter &amp; Weeks Stevedoring Co., 330 U.S. 422, 67 S. Ct. 815, and concede that the Act in question must be interpreted to take into account, as to each taxpayer, only the gross receipts which may properly be subjected to state taxation, cf.  Ratterman v. Western Union Tel. Co., 127 U.S. 411, 8 S. Ct. 1127, 32 L. Ed. 229.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants further point out, however, that the State's power to tax property is not destroyed by the fact that it is intended for and will move in interstate commerce ( Lacoste v. Dept. of Conservation, 263&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  U.S. 545, 551, 44 S. Ct. 186, 68 L. Ed. 437; Chassaniol v. Greenwood, 291 U.S. 584, 54 S. Ct. 541, 78 L. Ed. 1004), or by the fact that it has moved into the state in interstate commerce ( McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., 309 U.S. 33, 60 S. Ct. 388, 84 L. Ed. 565, 128 A.L.R. 876; Askren v. Continental Oil Co., 252 U.S. 444, 40 S. Ct. 355, 64 L. Ed. 654; Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, 286 U.S. 472, 52 S. Ct. 631, 76 L. Ed. 1232, 84 A.L.R. 831, affirming 166 S.C. 117, 164 S.E. 588).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the court held in Chassaniol v. Greenwood, supra [291 U.S. 584, 54 S. Ct. 542]:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ginning cotton, transporting it to Greenwood, and warehousing, buying, and compressing it there, are each, like the growing of it, steps in preparation for the sale and shipment in interstate or foreign commerce. But each step prior to the sale and shipment is a transaction local to Mississippi, a transaction in intrastate commerce. Hence those engaged in performing any such local function may be subjected to an occupation tax, just as the property used, or processed, by them may be subjected to a property tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus it is well settled that manufacture, extraction and severance are local activities&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prior to the sale and shipment in interstate and foreign commerce, and that an occupation tax on such activities may be graduated on the basis of value, measured by the sale price, when sold, of the article or product manufactured, extracted or severed, even if the sale should ultimately be in another State or country.  American Mfg. Co. v. St. Louis, 250 U.S. 459, 39 S. Ct. 522, 63 L. Ed. 1084; Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord, 262 U.S. 172, 43 S. Ct. 526, 67 L. Ed. 929; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., 260 U.S. 245, 43 S. Ct. 83, 67 L. Ed. 237; Hope Natural Gas Co. v. Hall, 274 U.S. 284, 47 S. Ct. 639, 71 L. Ed. 1049; Lacoste v. Dept. of Conservation, supra; International Harvester Co. v. Evatt, 329 U.S. 416, 67 S. Ct. 444.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In State ex rel. Coney v. Hicklin, 168 S.C. 440, 167 S.E. 674, 680, affirmed in Hicklin v. Coney, 290 U.S. 169, 54 S. Ct. 142, 78 L. Ed. 247, certain parties questioned the validity of a license tax imposed on all carriers by motor truck for hire, on the ground:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That said tax, imposed by the terms of said Act upon the 'gross receipts' of such carriers, was a tax upon receipts from interstate as well as intrastate business, constituted a burden on interstate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  commerce in contravention of article 1, section 8, of the Constitution of the United States * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The enforcement of the Act was devolved upon the State Railroad Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court held, in part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the case at bar the evidence is clear that the Railroad Commission has not at any time undertaken to construe the acts in question as imposing any taxes upon interstate operations, and, until this is done, respondent has no cause for complaint.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Santee Mills v. Query, supra, after quoting from Shaffer v. Carter, supra, the court held:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No showing has been made that the injurious results anticipated have eventuated in fact or that plaintiffs have in fact suffered prejudice. In the view taken of the purpose, scope, and meaning of the act as herein construed, it cannot be held that its enforcement will necessarily infringe the constitutional guaranties invoked by plaintiffs, and the court cannot assume in advance that such results will eventuate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Brickell, 233 U.S. 304, 34 S. Ct. 493, 496, 58 L. Ed. 974, a case involving an occupation or license tax, the court observed:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it is argued that the courts cannot properly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sustain a statute which in direct terms applies to all commerce, by restricting it to cases of actual interference with interstate dealings. * * * This argument, we think misses the point. The statute under consideration does not in direct terms or by necessary inference manifest an intent to regulate or burden interstate commerce. Full and fair effect can be given to its provisions, and an unconstitutional meaning can be avoided, by indulging the natural presumption that the legislature was intending to tax only that which it constitutionally might tax. So construed, it does not apply to interstate commerce at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the construction urged by the defendants, it is fair to assume that they will apply the Act in such manner that its practical operation and effect will be consistent with, and not violative of, the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, and, under the authorities which are applicable, an injunction should not be issued on a different assumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to extra-territorial operation within the State, the power of the General Assembly, which is unaffected by the commerce clause, is much broader. Cf.  Triplett v. City of Chester, 209 S.C. 455, 40 S.E.2d&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  684, and cases therein cited, especially Bluefield Produce &amp; Provision Co. v. City of Bluefield, 120 W. Va. 111, 196 S.E. 568. Nevertheless, the defendants do not contend for a broader application of the Act to business done within the state (but outside the portion of Charleston County in which it is applicable) than it would have to business done without the State, and certainly the plaintiffs have no valid ground of complaint under such application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is suggested by the plaintiffs that the Act should not be construed to include within a taxpayer's gross receipts the amount of taxes which were previously paid on merchandise sold by him, the contention being that this would impose the instant tax on such previous taxes. But the tax is not on the property itself; it is on the privilege of dealing with it. The value of such privilege is measured by the gross receipts therefrom, and this is a familiar and valid method of ascertaining such value. The sale price of all merchandise includes previous taxation, and the fact that previous taxes may be visibly indicated by stamps on the merchandise does not change the legal effect of the Act, or its construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also suggested&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the Act should be construed not to cover an occupation already licensed by the State, as for instance by the State tax on admissions. But the legislation imposing such State taxes does not purport to exclude local license taxes on the same occupations, or to exempt such occupations from a proper exaction for the support of local service which they enjoy. Cf.  American Mfg. Co. v. St. Louis, supra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is the Act, as constituted herein, a valid exercise of the taxing power of the General Assembly? In my opinion it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article X, section 1, of the State Constitution specifically authorizes graduated license taxes on occupations and business; Article X, section 5, empowers the General Assembly to vest the corporate authorities of various political subdivisions, including school districts, with power to assess and collect taxes for corporate purposes; and Article XI, section 6, provides that any school district may by the authority of the General Assembly levy an additional tax for the support of its schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A license tax &quot;is a tax in the ordinary acceptation of that term&quot;, and &quot;as such it comes within the provisions of our tax laws,&quot; ( Western Union Tel. Co. v. Town of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Winnsboro, 71 S.C. 231, 50 S.E. 870, 872), and specifically comes within the provisions of Article X, section 5, supra.  State v. Touchberry, 121 S.C. 5, 113 S.E. 345.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the Act conflict with any constitutional limitation on the legislative power? In my opinion it does not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs contend that it is a special law where a general law may be made applicable, in violation of Article III, section 34, of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, like counties, the individual districts are each separate taxing districts under Article X, section 5, and a law that is special only in the sense that it imposes a lawful tax limited in application and incidence to persons or property within a certain school district does not contravene the provisions of that section of the Constitution. State v. Touchberry, supra; Anderson v. Page, 208 S.C. 146, 37 S.E.2d 289; Moseley v. Welch, 209 S.C. 19, 39 S.E.2d 133; Murph v. Landrum, 76 S.C. 21, 28, 56 S.E. 850; Nettles v. Cantwell, 112 S.C. 24, 99 S.E. 765.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act applies uniformly to all persons and property within the area in which it is applicable, and it necessarily follows that there has been no denial of equal protection of the laws under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the state and federal Constitutions, as claimed by the plaintiffs.  Smith v. Robertson, 210 S.C. 99, 41 S.E.2d 631; Anderson v. Page, supra; Nettles v. Cantwell, supra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax imposed by the Act is an excise tax, and not a property tax, and Article I, section 6, relating to taxation of property in proportion to its value as well as Article X, section 1, relating to uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation, are inapplicable to it.  Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, 166 S.C. 117, 164 S.E. 588, affirmed in 286 U.S. 472, 52 S. Ct. 631, 76 L. Ed. 1232, 84 A.L.R. 831; Alderman v. Wells, 85 S.C. 507, 67 S.E. 781, 27 L.R.A. (N.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act under consideration is, in my opinion, a valid enactment and its enforcement may not be enjoined by the court. Accordingly, and for the reasons stated herein, it is ordered adjudged and decreed that the Demurrers to the Complaint in this action be, and the same hereby are sustained, and that the Complaint herein be and the same is hereby dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the light of the construction of the Act which I have adopted, I did not deem it necessary to consider its specific application to the individual plaintiffs. They and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  all other taxpayers have an adequate remedy at law under section 2808 by paying any doubtful or disputed taxes under protest and bringing action against the County Treasurer to recover the same. Such procedure is far better adapted to precise determination of the rights of a contesting taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I repeat that the tax in question is a school tax, and under section 2807, without entering upon the consideration of the question whether, under our decisions, a school district may be held liable for interest on taxes so paid (cf.  Southern Ry. Co. v. City Council of Greenville, 49 S.C. 449, 27 S.E. 652, and Paris Mountain Water Co. v. Woodside, 133 S.C. 383, 131 S.E. 37, with Monarch Mills v. South Carolina Tax Commission, 149 S.C. 219, 146 S.E. 870, and Nutt v. Ellerbe, D. C., 56 F.2d 1058), it is sufficient to observe that the favored position of the government in respect to interest is an incident of sovereignty and demanded by public policy, the expediency of allowing interest on its obligations being for the consideration of the legislature.  Monarch Mills v. South Carolina Tax Commission, supra. The Courts would fail to recognize this principle if they undertook to exercise equitable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jurisdiction merely because the legislature may not have seen fit to make such provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the service of the Summons and Complaint in this action, the Judge of the First Judicial Circuit issued a rule to show cause why an injunction pendente lite should not be granted, the Judge of the Ninth Judicial Circuit being out of the circuit. This rule was made returnable before the Judge of the Ninth Judicial Circuit, and pending hearing and determination thereon the defendants were temporarily restrained from enforcing the Act. In addition to their Demurrers to the Complaint, the defendants moved before me to vacate the temporary Restraining Order, but since the dismissal of the Complaint a fortiori vacates the rule and the temporary Restraining Order it is unnecessary to pass upon the motion to vacate.  </SPAN></P>

The trial judge imposed a sentence of 30 years. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial judge erred in refusing a motion for a directed verdict of not guilty on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction and that the sentence was excessive in violation of S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to enable the jury to find defendant guilty. However, the sentence was set aside and the matter was remanded for resentencing. The court noted that the sentence imposed was the equivalent of a life sentence and that there was nothing to justify the trial judge in disregarding the jury's recommendation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1927, the attorney's client recovered an alimony judgment against the judgment debtor. The client assigned a portion of the judgment to the attorney. The judgment debtor died in 1945. The attorney filed suit to collect on the judgment in 1946 without having revived the judgment at any time. The executor alleged that the suit was untimely, either because the 10-year statute of limitations had run or because the Act of the South Carolina General Assembly approved March 22, 1946, 44 Stats. page 1436, had eliminated the 20-year statute of limitations. The trial court awarded a money judgment to the attorney. The court reversed on appeal. The court held that the attorney could not collect on an unrevived judgment that was more than 10 years old without permission of the trial court, which he did not obtain. Thus, the trial court had no jurisdiction over the action. The suit was not one in equity because only money was sought. In any event, a judgment lien could not be enforced in equity where it could not be enforced at law. As an alternate ground, the court held that the 1946 Act would also bar the suit.</SPAN></P>

Where there was no such reasonable likelihood, the burden was on defendant to prove actual vindictiveness. Defendant failed to meet the burden of proving actual vindictiveness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a South Carolina county and its administrator, argued that the trial court erred by concluding that appellants lacked the statutory authority to suspend employees of appellee, the elected county auditor. Specifically, appellants asserted that the powers granted to them by S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 4-9-25(1998) and S.C. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 17 may not, by law, be construed to limit their authority. Thus, their administration of personnel policies, including suspension, was not precluded by S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 4-9-30(7) -- barring counties from hiring or firing an elected official's employees -- as this provision did not expressly prohibit suspensions. The court disagreed, ruling that appellants lacked express authority to suspend appellee's employees. To give a county control over an elected official's employees, the court explained, could force appellee to place the county's interests over those of the electorate, and could have a devastating impact on appellee's ability to carry out his duties. However, the award of attorney fees to appellee pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 15-77-300 was improper, as the trial court failed to make the requisite statutory findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed that appellants, a South Carolina county and its administrator, lacked authority to suspend employees of appellee, an elected official, as appellants' power to administer personnel policies did not, absent explicit statutory authorization, extend to officials whose interests were to serving electorate, but reversed and remanded as to attorney fee award to appellee, as trial court failed to make requisite statutory findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought by appellant corporation alleging breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and civil conspiracy, appellant sought review of the trial court's decision granting respondent Chilean resident's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court held that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 36-2-803(1)(c) (1976), the state's long-arm statute, authorized service of process on respondent. Complaint alleged that respondent acted to cause appellant a tortious injury within the state. The court held that an exercise of jurisdiction over respondent comported with the due process requirements under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Respondent established minimum contacts with the state by allegedly committing several intentional torts by devaluing a state corporation. In addition, if respondent acted to compromise the financial condition of a state corporation, respondent could have reasonably anticipated being haled into the state court. The court held that jurisdiction would be fair given the significant state interest in preventing tortious injury within the state and because respondent should not be allowed to tortiously purchase state assets without having to abide by the state's laws.</SPAN></P>

It held that although neither the County and Municipal Employee Grievance Act, S.C.

The Board of Health and Environmental Control upheld the issuance of the permit. The Spartanburg Circuit Court (South Carolina) affirmed the board's decision and appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants raised several claims of error. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court rejected appellants' claim that the waste management company gave false and misleading information that they relied on in deciding not to file a petition. The court found that appellants were not prejudiced because this misinformation involved technical environmental issues that were not negotiable issues under the facility issues negotiation process. The court also found that the waste management company complied with the statutory notice provisions. However, the court held that the lower court erred in finding that appellants were afforded an adjudicatory hearing on the merits of the issuance of the permit. The court found that citizens had standing to request an adjudicatory hearing on the merits of the issuance of a landfill permit, but that they were never granted such a hearing because the hearing officer's decision only addressed the motion to dismiss. In addition, the court found that the lower court erred in finding that the waste management company complied with the statutory requirements regarding demonstration of the need for the expansion of its facility.</SPAN></P>

The trial court set aside the adoption finding that the birth mother's consent to the adoption was procured by fraud. The adoptive parents appealed and the court reversed and remanded. The court found that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 20-7-1800 provided that an adoption decree was not subject to collateral attack after a period of one year following its issuance.

Appellant brought an action alleging that the city's actions prevented him from making repairs. The trial court granted summary judgment to the city.

The master found a taking had occurred and ordered that the landowner be compensated. The council sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The council claimed that the master erred by basing his findings and conclusions of law on alleged irregularities committed by the council and that there was substantial evidence to support the council's denial of the permits.

The court held that the master's findings of the council's irregularities were irrelevant to the determination of a taking. The court agreed with the council that the record supported the denial of the permits on the basis that the lots were wetlands and that erecting bulkheads and adding fill to the lots would have an adverse environmental impact. However, the court upheld the determination that a taking had occurred because the denial of the permits left each of the landowner's lots without any economically beneficial use. Because there was insufficient evidence to support the compensation award made by the master, the court remanded the case for a determination of the appropriate amount to be awarded to the landowner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer's predecessor in interest purchased the property in 1991 for $ 16,610,000. At the time of the county's appraisal, the improvements on the property were one year old and 75 percent of the property's finished space was occupied. The county assessor analyzed the property using the cost method, the income capitalization method, and the sales comparison method. He then performed an equitable analysis comparing his appraisals of the property to those of other properties. The ALJ concluded that the cost approach yielded the most accurate valuation of the property and determined that the property should be valued at $ 9,000,000 for the 1992 tax year. On appeal, the proceeding before the ALJ is in the nature of a de novo hearing. There was sufficient evidence presented to support the $ 9,000,000 valuation of the property. While the state constitution required equality and uniformity in tax assessments, absolute accuracy with respect to valuation and complete equality and uniformity were not practically attainable. The fact that another property may be undervalued did not render the accurate valuation of the property constitutionally defective. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs entered into a contract to sell the property, sought to quiet title, and to partition the property by sale. The trial court held, in part, that the putative daughter was an heir by virtue of representation through her late father. The court reversed as to the putative daughter, but otherwise affirmed. At the time of the decedent's death, South Carolina law allowed illegitimate children to inherit only from their mothers. That law was later declared unconstitutional and given a limited retroactive application based upon a tripartite test. Although the putative daughter met two of the conditions, being that innocent persons would not be adversely affected and the estate administration was subject to further resolution, she failed a third criteria requiring that her paternity had been conclusively established either by court order or decree issued prior to the death of the father or by an instrument signed by the father acknowledging paternity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as to the determination that the illegitimate daughter could inherit her putative father's share.

He told the officer that he did not have a driver's license and that he had been drinking just before the accident. Defendant made a motion to suppress these statements, claiming they violated Miranda. At the scene, witnesses identified defendant as the driver of the truck, at which time defendant was arrested and read his Miranda rights. The court held that there was no custodial interrogation requiring Miranda warnings before defendant was arrested and given his rights. The court further held that the trial court did not err in denying his motion for a change of venue due to pretrial publicity because the trial court thoroughly questioned the jurors as to any publicity they had encountered. The court further held that the trial court did not err in allowing defendant to receive punishments for both reckless homicide and felony DUI causing death because the &quot;same offense&quot; test was not satisfied.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that there was insufficient evidence for the possession charges and that his convictions of possession with intent to distribute and distribution violate his double jeopardy rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant agreed to sell four ounces of crack cocaine to a narcotics agent, but because the agent decided at the last minute to buy two ounces, defendant's accomplice kept two ounces. As a result, defendant was convicted on drug charges. On appeal, the court vacated the convictions and sentences for possession with intent to distribute and possession with intent to distribute within proximity to a school. The court held that because defendant had actual knowledge of the cocaine kept by his accomplice, whether defendant had constructive possession with intent to distribute the cocaine found in the accomplice's apartment was a jury question. However, because both distribution of cocaine and possession with intent to distribute were found in S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-53-375(B) (Supp. 1994), and because a completed sale was not required to constitute distribution, defendant's conviction for distribution and possession with intent to distribute for the same acts violated defendant's rights against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Seven defendants sought review of a judgment rendered by the Circuit Court for Darlington County (South Carolina), which convicted them of trafficking in more than 400 grams of cocaine, in violation of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 44-53-370(e)(2)(e) (Supp. 1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In addition to double jeopardy, each defendant challenged various issues, including: sufficiency of evidence, admission of evidence of other drug-related bad acts, refusal to grant a mistrial despite the jury's exposure to hearsay evidence, admission of improper impeachment testimony, improper jury charge, and refusal to allow presentation of constitutional claims after the verdict. They also argued that the cocaine trafficking cocaine statute violates the Equal Protection Clause, and denied them the opportunity to participate in supervised furlough. The court upheld all of the convictions, except for one, holding that the State failed to present sufficient evidence to show transactions that constituted trafficking or participation in the conspiracy as to that defendant. As to the remaining defendants, the court stated that the evidence was sufficient to find them guilty and the State did not violate their rights to a fair trial or subject them to double jeopardy. The court also held that evidence of marijuana dealing, although a prior bad act, was admissible to show identity and motive. The constitutional attacks on the cocaine trafficking statute were without merit.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance did not violate defendant's constitutional right to freedom of speech. He was arrested while shouting obscenities and racial streets on a public street. He was arrested not merely for his words, but for his behavior. Defendant's behavior met the requirement of &quot;fighting words&quot; and the officers clearly exercised a higher degree of restraint than was expected from the average citizen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A contractor brought a foreclosure action against customers for their alleged failure to pay in full for renovations to their home. The customers counterclaimed for, among other things, breach of contract and unfair trade practices. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court affirmed the judgments against the customers. The findings of a cost plus contract and the customers' liability for extra costs, changes, and deficiencies were supported by sufficient evidence. There was no evidence to support their unfair trade practices claim. With respect to the contractor, the court affirmed the denial of prejudgment interest. The contractor failed to meet its burden of establishing a stated account and the parties' agreement, express or implied, that the account was a true statement due at a specific point. However, the court reversed the denial of attorney fees. The court held that, in order to protect the private interest of contractors who dealt directly with an owner, &quot;may,&quot; as used in S.C.

The police obtained a search warrant and searched defendant's cousins' house. The police found marijuana.

The trial judge ruled that the warrant was defective, but that the evidence was admissible under the good faith exception. Defendant was convicted of possession with intent to distribute marijuana. Defendant appealed. The court found that the trial judge correctly ruled that the warrant was defective because the affidavit did not contain information sufficient for the issuing magistrate to make a determination of probable cause. The court held that the good faith exception did not apply because there was no objective basis for concluding that the officer acted in reasonable reliance on the warrant, believing it to be valid. The officer testified that he knew the affidavit was supposed to contain information concerning the reliability of the informant, and he had no explanation for not having included the information.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was named executor under a 1980 will. Respondent was named executrix under a will allegedly executed in 1982. The original of the 1982 will was never presented to the probate court. The probate court ruled that the 1980 will was properly executed and the 1982 will had also been properly executed, but, because the original was never located, it was presumed destroyed animo revocandi. The probate court also held that the presumed destruction of the 1982 will did not revive the 1980 will because the evidence did not show that the decedent intended to revive the will. Appellant sought review and the court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The court found that the probate court erred in applying the 1987 Probate Code to the trial of the case. Because the decedent could have intentionally destroyed the 1982 will knowing that the law as it then existed would have revived the 1980 will, the presumption under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 62-2-508 (1987) would have frustrated the intent of the decedent. The court also found that the appellant, having made no objection, request for a curative instruction, or motion for a mistrial, could not complain of some of the probate court's remarks.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff's appeal raised the identical issues as raised in the trial court. On appeal, the court found that the judgment of the agency (the Department) was reasonable and proper. The record contained more than sufficient evidence to support the conclusions of the administrative review board. Further, it was clear from the board's order read as a whole that the board fully exercised its authority to weigh the evidence, and make a decision on the merits based upon the preponderance of evidence. Review of the hearing officer's report and recommendations and the transcript of record left no doubt that all of the issues raised by plaintiff were thoroughly addressed throughout the administrative process. The board's findings, with regard to inconsistency with the funding plans of the state Medicaid agency and failure to demonstrate financial feasibility, were supported by the record. The record also contained abundant evidence that the health care center's project was superior to that of plaintiff's.</SPAN></P>

The school district constructed a school on its property and built a drainage system to drain surface water away from its property. The property owner's land eroded and made it unsuitable for the planned development of the property. On appeal, the court stated that the property owner's complaint fell under the two exceptions to the Common Enemy Rule. The two exceptions were: that a landowner could not use his land in a manner to create a nuisance and that he could not discharge water in a concentrated form upon his neighbor's land. The court determined that the property owner's complaint was barred by the statute of limitations because his damages resulted from an incident that occurred more than six years prior to the date in which he filed his action.

In the alternative, the father argued that the statute was unconstitutional because, he claimed, the basis of the child's punishment, was his religious belief. The mother argued she was not guilty of neglect based upon the father's actions. The court found that, excluded from the definition of child abuse was corporal punishment that met certain guidelines, listed in &sect; 20-7-490(C)(1)(e). A doctor testified at the abuse hearing that a great deal of force was required to inflict the bruises on the child. The court found that the force used by the father was not reasonable. The court also found that &sect; 20-7-490 was not unconstitutional because it did not, as the father argued, impinge upon the father's right to free exercise of religion.

The trial court held that plaintiff landowner was not using its property in a manner prohibited by the Town's ordinance, and that its use constituted a preexisting, non-conforming use permitted by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The largest of the landowner's tracts was zoned as a planned unit development (PUD) and was the principal location of the development. The property involved in the appeal was a smaller parcel, referred to as the &quot;Cabana&quot; property. The Town alleged that the landowner was using the Cabana property for commercial activities that violated a zoning ordinance because the parcel was located in an R-1 district. The town claimed that the trial court applied the wrong standard in reviewing the Zoning Board's decision. In reversing, the court held that, under S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 6-7-780, the trial court was required to affirm the factual findings of the Board if there was any evidence to support them, and the findings were not influenced by an error of law. Further, &sect; 6-7-780 did not violate due process because the right to appellate review was not a necessary element of due process. The court opined that it was undisputed that the Cabana Property was in an R-1 zone, and that the prohibited commercial activities that the Town complained about were not taking place when the zoning ordinance was adopted. Thus, in the court's view, there was no prior non-conforming use.</SPAN></P>

Testimony by plaintiff's president that landowners contacted him about increased rents, in which he was attempting to show he had to pay more rent in order to keep his leases due to defendant's actions, was not hearsay. The issue of whether particular practices engaged in by the parties constituted improper interference and the issue of alleged unfair competition were matters for the jury to decide.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband sought a divorce on the ground of one year's continuous separation, and the wife counterclaimed for support for herself and the parties' children. The husband replied to the counterclaim with a general denial that he should be required to pay support to the wife. At a hearing on issues of equitable distribution and support, over the wife's objection that adultery had not been pled, the trial court concluded that the husband's general denial of the wife's request for support was sufficient to support the introduction of evidence on the wife's adultery and allowed the husband's attorney to cross-examine the wife regarding her adulterous relationships after the separation. The trial court then held that &sect; 20-3-130 (1976) barred the wife from recovering alimony. The court reversed. Insofar as the husband's adultery claim went beyond the wife's basic claim for support and depended on additional facts to defeat the support claim, it was an avoidance that introduced new matter and had to be pled pursuant to S.C. R. Civ. P. 8(c). Since it was not pled, the evidence relating to adultery was inadmissible, and the wife was not barred form receiving alimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the wife's marriage to the husband, the husband deeded the marital property to the son. A fire partially destroyed the house and insurance proceeds were paid into court. The court concluded that the trial court incorrectly subtracted her insurance recovery from her dower interest. The wife had no property interest to insure, and therefore what was insured was only her expectancy of dower in the property. The trial court did not err in declining to apply the law of quarantine. The doctrine of quarantine did not apply because the wife did not have an interest in the house after her husband died. Therefore, her dower interest could be offset against by amounts awarded to the son. The wife's right to receive interest on her dower award accrued only from the date she vacated the property after the fire. The wife was not entitled to interest on her award because she had not been deprived of her right to dower in the property. The wife was entitled to reimbursement for repairs on the property as she did not have an interest in the property. The son was entitled to $ 350 per month rent on the property while the wife lived on the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court consolidated two actions challenging the rezoning of certain land.

On appeal, the court held that the action of the county council in declining to change the zoning classification of the property from D-1 to C-3 and in changing the zoning classification of the property to C-1 was not patently unreasonable. It was not unreasonable to refuse to zone it as commercial property because the property was not surrounded by commercial property. The property abutted commercial and residential property. The court found that regardless of whether the county council's act of rezoning the subject tract was a legislative function or a quasi-judicial function, the court found that there was substantial evidence that the land in question was susceptible to a reasonable and lawful use under the classification imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, property developers, government agencies and officials, and related persons (developers), appealed the decision from a trial court in Lexington County (South Carolina), which denied the developers' demurrers to the amended complaint by plaintiffs, a class of property residents and owners (residents), in their suit for an alleged unconstitutional taking, negligent construction, and a breach of an implied warranty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners alleged that they suffered damage from a development project. The developers argued that the class should not have been certified, that there was improper joinder, and that the pleadings were insufficient. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court in part. Since the date of the trial court's order, a new rule on joinder, S.C. R. Civ. P. 18(a), went into effect. The rule was applied, and there was no longer a requirement that all causes of action affect all parties. The class was proper. The new rule on class actions, S.C. R. Civ. P. 23, allowed for more liberality in defining classes. There was no improper joinder of parties plaintiff under the new rule, that of S.C. R. Civ. P. 20(a). The fact that the class had a fluid membership did not render it indefinable. The failure of the developers to make positive improvements did not constitute a taking. Certain objections to the suit were raised for the first time on appeal and waived. A cause of action existed for an implied warranty of fitness of improved land. However, there had to be a sale, and the owners did not sufficiently allege facts alleging sales. The owners could obtain injunction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed in part and affirmed in part. The trial court incorrectly failed to dismiss the claim for an unconstitutional taking and the claim for a breach of an implied warranty of fitness. The trial court ruled properly in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

The mother's various motions at trial had been denied on the ground that at the time of the collision, the doctrine of parental immunity had been abolished in automobile accident cases. The mother argued that she was entitled to the defense of parental immunity because the doctrine had not been effectively abolished at the time the cause of action arose. The father conceded that the case law following the partial abrogation of the doctrine of parental immunity by the South Carolina Legislature supported the mother's position; however, he argued that an exception should have been made to allow the suit where insurance was available to satisfy any damages awarded. The court declined to carve out such an exception and overturned the decision below. The court first noted that the father had failed to raise preserve the issue for appeal. Second, the court could not look beyond the record on appeal in order to verify the insurance coverage.

The trial court erred in awarding attorney's fees without making findings of fact, so the trial court was ordered to determine appropriate attorney's fees on remand. The court found that the trial court properly considered four facts in determining whether support should have been ordered. However, two other considerations were to be taken into account when ordering support for an emancipated child to attend college: (1) the availability of grants and loans; and (2) the ability of the child to earn income during the school year or on vacation.

The mother and daughter were killed in an automobile accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the doctrine of parental immunity existed so as to bar suit by the daughter's estate against the mother's estate for damages resulting from the accident. Appellant maintained that the actions were not barred because S.C. Code &sect; 15-5-210 (1976) was in existence at the time the daughter received her fatal injuries in the crash. In affirming, the court noted that &sect; 15-5-210 had been held unconstitutional. Thus, on the date the actions were begun, the statute no longer precluded a parent from asserting the doctrine of parental immunity as a defense to an action brought by his or her unemancipated child for personal injuries received by the child in a motor vehicle accident. Moreover, because the abrogation of the doctrine of parental immunity applied prospectively only and the doctrine could be interposed as a defense to a tort action brought by an unemancipated child based on an event occurring before the doctrine's abrogation, the court concluded that the doctrine clearly afforded the mother's estate a complete defense to the tort actions brought by the daughter's estate, as they were based on an event that happened prior to the doctrine's abrogation.</SPAN></P>

The court traced the history of contributory negligence in South Carolina and concluded that it had been applied simply because it was never challenged. The court reviewed several statutes and concluded that there was no statutory basis for the general application of contributory negligence in South Carolina. The court reviewed the history of the comparative negligence doctrine and concluded that it had never been applied in South Carolina because the use of contributory negligence had not been challenged. The court determined that it had the implied authority from the state supreme court to abrogate contributory negligence. The court adopted a modified form of comparative negligence, holding that a plaintiff would be able to recover as long as his negligence was not greater than that of the defendant, and that the plaintiff's recovery would be reduced in proportion to the negligence. The court held that the doctrine would be applied prospectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board initiated a complaint against the doctor, a practicing psychiatrist. The board's disciplinary panel found that the doctor had been convicted of eight counts of housebreaking and grand larceny, had written prescriptions for controlled substances outside a bona fide physician-patient relationship, repurchased them, and had engaged in conduct which was indicative of sociopathic and possibly psychopathic behavior. The panel recommended revocation of the doctor's license. The board adopted the recommendation. The trial court dismissed the doctor's petition for judicial review of the board's decision. The doctor appealed. The court held that the panel findings were supported by substantial evidence and there was no abuse of discretion in the imposition of license revocation as a sanction for the doctor's violations of the law and board regulations. The court rejected the doctor's argument that the circuit court erred in not reversing the revocation order on the ground that the finding that he suffered from a mental disorder lacked a substantial evidentiary basis. The panel specifically disclaimed this finding as necessary to its recommendation that his license be revoked.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The society sought a refund of ad valorem taxes paid under protest. The court affirmed the ruling in favor of the society on tax exemption, finding that the society was a fraternal organization within the meaning of S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-37-220B(12) because it was formed with the purpose of engaging in charitable work, its hall was used primarily for holding the society's meetings and the conduct of its business, and no profit or benefit from such business inured to the benefit of any individual society member. The court reversed the trial court's failure to award interest on the refund, finding that S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 12-47-230 required a city or town to pay six percent interest from the date of payment on a refund of taxes paid under protest. The city argued that &sect; 12-47-230 was unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection under S.C. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3 because of the different treatment of cities and counties. The court determined that because there was no express authority in the South Carolina Constitution that allowed the city to challenge the validity of &sect; 12-47-230, the city was required to pay interest on the society's tax refund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband, who was a naval officer, was on involuntary sea duty for seven months of the one year period. He contended that including his period of military service in the 12 months needed for a no-fault divorce was contrary to public policy and a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed the order. When a spouse served in the military and the parties were separated before the military service began or when the separation was independent of military service, though during service, a divorce on the grounds of separation was proper. The parties' separation was independent of the husband's military service because the wife clearly manifested her intent to separate before the husband left for sea duty. Granting the divorce was not against public policy because a one-year separation was a ground for divorce under &sect; 20-3-10(5), which was passed to implement a constitutional amendment favorably approved by referendum. The husband's equal protection rights were not violated because &sect; 20-3-10(5) was presumed to be constitutional. Members of the military were protected by the rule that separation had to be independent of military duty.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the student's slander judgment. The court held that under modern rule, words were given their ordinary and popular meaning. Because the jury found the words were defamatory, the court refused to set aside their verdict. The court held that &sect; 15-75-10, which made the false imputation of unchastity to a female actionable without proof of special damages, was constitutional because it applied to males in the same way. The court reviewed the historical context that gave rise to the statute and found that the statute was adopted solely to change a rule set down in a case that happened to involve an accusation of unchaste behavior by a female. There was no reason that the statute would not apply equally to males who were accused of unchastity, therefore the statute treated both sexes the same.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate of a state penitentiary instituted several civil actions against that facility. The circuit court appointed two attorneys to represent in the inmate in those proceedings. The attorneys filed a motion seeking to be relieved of their appointment, contending that the circuit court deprived them of their constitutional rights under U.S. Const. amends. XIV and XV in requiring them to represent the inmate without compensation. The circuit court agreed that the inmate was not entitled to appointed counsel; despite this finding, however, the circuit court refused to vacate the order of appointment. The attorneys appealed. In remanding for reconsideration, the court concluded that courts had the power to do all things reasonably necessary to ensure that just results were reached, and this included the power to appoint lawyers to serve without compensation where justice so required. Before such appointment would be proper, however, the appointing court must determine that the case is extraordinary and requires the appointment of counsel in order to render justice and that the litigant is unable to secure a lawyer on his own.</SPAN></P>
