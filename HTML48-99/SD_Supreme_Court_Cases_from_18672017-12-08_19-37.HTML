</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer and the disposal corporation commenced an action against the secretary and the State by filing an application for peremptory writ of prohibition of a statewide special election and a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment concerning the State of South Dakota's entry into the Dakota Interstate Low-level Radioactive Waste Management Compact. The circuit court upheld 1984 S.D. Laws 240 from constitutional attack and denied the writ of prohibition. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. It held that the election could proceed because the legislature had inherent power to refer its own acts since the legislative power of South Dakota's legislature was unlimited. The court determined that whatever the representatives of the people were not forbidden to do by the organic law, they could do. The court reasoned that where there were unconstitutional provisions of an act, the unconstitutional provisions could be extracted and the remainder left intact. The court ruled that the taxpayer and the disposal corporation had standing to bring the action because the taxpayer did not have to suffer special injury to institute an action to protect a public right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court Second Judicial Circuit, Minnehaha County (South Dakota) convicting him of two counts of aiding and abetting the distribution of cocaine in violation of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-3-3 and one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-3-8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several co-conspirators testified that defendant had participated in an interstate scheme to sell cocaine. On appeal, the court held that the State was not limited to proving only those overt acts alleged in the indictment. The indictment adequately placed defendant on notice of the charge of conspiracy by alleging the elements of the offense, the code sections violated, the names of defendant's co-conspirators, and the two-year time span of the conspiracy. The State did not conceal the fact that it intended to present evidence of defendant's cocaine purchases in California; even though the State was tardy in responding to a bill of particulars, defendant had access to State's witnesses who testified to his California activities. Evidence of defendant's cocaine dealings with a deceased co-conspirator in California during the year before he was arrested was admissible to show preparation and plan. Testimony by defendant's accomplices was sufficiently corroborated under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-22-8 by the testimony of the deceased co-conspirator's wife. Publicity about the co-conspirator's sudden death on the day he was to have pled guilty did not require a change of venue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two deputies witnessed defendant's car weaving in its lane and crossing the center line. After pulling defendant over, the deputies noticed that defendant smelled of alcohol, slurred his speech, and had bloodshot eyes. Defendant admitted that he had been drinking and refused to perform field sobriety tests. The deputies then placed him under arrest and took him into custody. The trial court refused to suppress testimony regarding defendant's refusal to submit to the field sobriety test and defendant appealed from his conviction. The court affirmed the conviction and held that (1) dexterity tests were real physical evidence and were not protected by the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination; (2) S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-1.2 permitted implementation of the preliminary breath test as a field sobriety test, which, like the traditional mental and physical dexterity tests, could be given upon reasonable suspicion that a person had violated S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-1; (3) defendant's refusal to perform the tests was not communicative in nature; and (4) defendant was not in custody when he stated that he had been drinking, so his admissions were not covered by Miranda.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to &sect; 10-44-2(3), each unlicensed insurer doing business in the state was required to pay an insurance premium tax. The insurer, which was not licensed to transact business in the state, assumed ownership of certain policies insuring residents of the state. The insurer collected premiums from and paid claims to those policyholders. However, the insurer asserted that it was not doing &quot;insurance business&quot; in the state and was not subject to the premium tax. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment in favor of the state and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the state's complaint. The court held that &sect; 10-44-2(3) was unconstitutional to the extent that it imposed a tax on foreign insurers that was greater than that imposed on other insurers. The court found that the insurer's contacts with the state were sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction. The court also held that the state could maintain an action at law to collect taxes from foreign insurers that had no property within the state. However, the higher tax imposed on foreign insurers constituted an impermissible denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants state and secretary of revenue sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court on the Sixth Judicial Circuit, Hughes County (South Dakota) that found S.D. Codified Laws ch. 10-39-53 was an invalid discrimination violating S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 17 and 18. Plaintiff mining company alleged that the statute violated the state constitution by increasing the rate of taxation on the mine's income without a proper vote of the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mining company alleged that the mineral severance tax imposed by S.D. Codified Laws ch. 10-39-53 was unconstitutional as it increased the tax rate without proper legislative vote, it imposed unfair, unjust, arbitrary, and unequal taxes on the mining company and burdened interstate commerce in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The state and revenue secretary were granted partial summary judgment and both parties appealed. The court reversed the ruling that held that the 1,000-ounce exemption contained in S.D. Codified Laws ch. 10-39-53 violated the equal protection clause and held that the classification was based on the frequency and character of the activity engaged in and were permissible considerations for the legislature. Further, the court held that the tax imposed by S.D. Codified Laws ch. 10-39 constituted a tax on the privilege of severing precious metals within the state and was not a sales or income tax, and affirmed the trial court. The court held that the retroactive application of ch. 10-39 was confined to a short and limited period that did not extend beyond the calendar year and only included transactions consummated while in the process of enactment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate disputed the quashing of his application for a writ of habeas corpus and the dismissal of his amended application for habeas corpus by the Circuit Court of the Fourth Judicial Circuit, Lake County, South Dakota. The inmate argued he was denied his constitutional right to due process through ineffective assistance of counsel both at trial and when appellate counsel failed to perfect an appeal of his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellate counsel omitted a crucial step in attempting to perfect the appeal: he failed to timely file the notice of appeal with the clerk of courts. On appeal, the court noted that the appellate attorney's request for a late filing was properly denied because the time limit specified in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-32-15 was jurisdictional. After reviewing the standards for establishing ineffective assistance, the court agreed with the trial court that the inmate had not demonstrated prejudicial error at his trial proceedings, so appellate counsel's failure to properly bring the appeal was not in and of itself sufficient to entitle him to question his by collateral attack. Given that an in-court identification at trial was reliable and had a sound origin independent of a photo lineup, trial counsel had not been so ineffective as to deny the inmate his constitutional right of due process. Another trial issue raised by the inmate, whether his ex-wife's testimony should have been suppressed, was not an ineffective assistance issue, given that trial counsel had not moved for suppression. Thus, the inmate failed to show a likelihood of success on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) issued a civil investigative demand to appellant highway construction company president to appear and be examined under oath as to his knowledge concerning antitrust violations in South Dakota's highway construction industry. As a condition of compliance, appellant requested an order granting immunity under S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 23A-14-29 and 37-1-19, contending that inasmuch as &sect; 37-1-19 did not afford a grant of use and derivative use immunity, it was not coextensive with the U.S. Const. amend V, privilege against self-incrimination and was therefore unconstitutional. The district court concluded that &sect; 37-1-19 was constitutional and ordered enforcement of the demand subject to a grant of immunity solely under &sect; 37-1-19. Appellant sought review of the order and the court dismissed the case as moot because &sect; 37-1-19 was repealed between the appeal and appellant's appearance before the OAG, rendering a decision on &sect; 37-1-19 constitutionality wholly academic under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 13-34-16.2, 13-34-16.3 (Michie, as amended 1977), the federal district court granted the summary judgment in favor of the school district, which was affirmed in part on the taxpayers' facial challenge to the textbook loan statutes under the First Amendment. However, the federal appellate court ruled the district court had failed to adequately consider the taxpayers' federal constitutional challenge, and remanded with directions to reconsider the claim based upon the South Dakota Constitution. On the federal district court's certified question, the court held that the South Dakota textbook loan statutes, as amended by the 1977 S.D. Laws ch. 134, &sect; 2, were unconstitutional on their face under S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 3, and S.D. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 16 because those constitutional provisions prohibited every form, whether as a gift or otherwise, the appropriation of the public funds for the benefit or to aid any sectarian school or institution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the denial of certain portions of his motion to suppress evidence and the use of suppressed evidence at his sentencing hearing. In affirming the conviction, the court found that the search warrant arose from an independent source of information. The evidence showed that the preparation of the affidavit was commenced prior to the securing of defendant's house. The information as to the address, and the fact that the buy money and additional cocaine were present, was obtained from a third person outside the house and prior to the entry. In addition, the inclusion in the affidavit of an incorrect identification of an individual as the occupant of the house, did not render the search warrants invalid. Further, the ledger book was admissible because it was in plain view, it was opened to search for the buy money, and the officer was acting in good faith when he inadvertently discovered its contents. Finally, due to the transient nature of the items sought, the requisite reasonable cause existed for nighttime service. There was no prejudice from the failure of an officer to read back what the magistrate had authorized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found in a burglarized apartment. Two psychiatric evaluations found defendant sane and competent to stand trial. Defendant challenged the admissibility of incriminating statements that he made to the psychiatrists during the course of psychiatric examinations. The court held that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-10-4 required defendant, who raised the insanity defense, to submit himself for examination. Although communications with a psychotherapist were generally privileged under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 19-13-7, there was an exception to the privilege in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 19-13-10 for court-ordered examinations for determining sanity or competency. The court read S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 19-13-11 to mean that the exception to the psychotherapist privilege was limited to communications that were relevant to establish mental illness or competency, rather than guilt. The court concluded that defendant's statements were a necessary basis for the psychiatrists' opinions on sanity. Defendant failed to show an abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal to direct a bifurcated trial. Given the strong evidence of the burglary, the evidence of his statements was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate sought to run for the office of commissioner of school and public lands in the general election in November, 1984.

This court denied the request without prejudice to the candidate's right to pursue the petition in the trial court. The trial court issued an alternative writ but concluded that secretary of state was correct in refusing to issue a certificate of election to the candidate. On appeal, the court ruled that the trial court properly refused to require the secretary of state to certify the election of the candidate for the position of commissioner of school and public lands because an election for that office was not authorized in a presidential election year pursuant to S.D. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 2 and 7, which prescribed a four year term for such office.

Laws 138.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers alleged, among other things, that the closing of a campus of the University of South Dakota provided for in 1984 S.D.

VIII, &sect; 7, that the transfer of control of the campus to the Board of Charities and Corrections impaired bond contracts in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and S.D. Const. art.

The trial court held that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to the constitutionality of 1984 S.D. Laws 138. The court held that the legislative transfer of trust property to another state governmental agency without reimbursing the trust fund for the transferred property's full market value was unconstitutional and in violation of the Enabling Act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's conviction of third degree burglary, three years of his sentence and $ 4000 of his fine were suspended on the condition that defendant make restitution to the victim in the amount of $ 432 within 18 months of sentencing, reimburse the county for court-appointed counsel fees, and reimburse his appointed counsel for the difference between the total legal fees and the amount paid by the county. The circuit court thereafter determined that defendant was in violation of these terms and conditions, revoked the suspended portions of the sentence, and ordered that defendant be returned to the state penitentiary to serve the remaining three years of his sentence and be required to pay the entire amount of the fine originally imposed. On appeal, defendant contended that he had been unlawfully and unconstitutionally imprisoned due to his indigency. The court affirmed the judgment. The court concluded that the circuit court's findings with respect to defendant's ability to make at least some payment towards restitution, the fine, and his attorney fees found adequate support in the record in spite of the fact that defendant did suffer from some physical disability.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was then sentenced to 18 months in the state penitentiary. Defendant filed an appeal challenging his convictions. Specifically, defendant argued that the trial court's reliance on S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-4.1 constituted a retroactive application of the statute. Defendant further argued that the guilty pleas entered at the time of his first and second DWI convictions were rendered involuntary because the trial court informed him that they could be used for enhancement purposes for four years. The court affirmed defendant's convictions on appeal. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it found him guilty of a third DWI offense. The court recognized that the five-year enhancement provision under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-4.1 was not in effect at the time of defendant's two prior convictions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The truck driver was arrested for driving a truck that was over the weight limit. He was fined for violation of the Class 2 misdemeanor provided by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-22-16, and was also ordered to pay an additional fine pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-22-55. On appeal, the truck driver contended that the imposition of the second fine constituted a double punishment in violation of S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9. The court ruled that the sanctions imposed pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-22-55 were not criminal in nature, noting that the statute was enacted after the criminal statute,&nbsp;S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-22-16, and had the legislature intended that the sanctions be penal in nature, it would have reclassified the violation of the criminal statute,&nbsp;S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-22-16 to a class 1 misdemeanor. The court also ruled that the amount of the penalty imposed under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-22-55 was not so clearly excessive as to bear no relationship to the purpose for it was imposed. The court also ruled that the truck driver was not denied due process where he received the procedural safeguards afforded to him under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-22-16.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's car went over the center line, and the occupant of a vehicle coming from the opposite direction was killed. Two police officers who came to the scene observed the strong odor of alcohol on defendant's breath. During his trial, the prosecutor asked defendant if his car smelled of marijuana on the night before the accident, and the trial court sustained defendant's objection. Additionally, eyewitnesses observed defendant completely cross the center lane before the accident occurred. Defendant was convicted of vehicular homicide, and the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 22-16-41 was not unconstitutionally vague because courts had the power to supply the meaning of the phrase &quot;under the influence of an alcoholic beverage,&quot; which was contained in &sect; 22-16-41. Because the trial court's instructions adequately defined the phrase, the crime was defined with definiteness and certainty and defendant's due process rights were not violated. The court ruled that the question about marijuana was absolute prosecutorial error but that the error was harmless, and the court further ruled that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of vehicular homicide.</SPAN></P>

The lendees were to account to the lender for the original herd and livestock purchased. The lender had the right to enter the premises at a reasonable time to inspect its collateral. The lender attempted to exercise its right to inspect the livestock. Entry was refused. The lender filed an action to enforce the right of inspection with an alternate cause for possession of the livestock should the inspection disclose an event of default as described in the agreement. Inspection was ordered by the trial court. The trial court later granted an application for appointment of a receiver. On appeal, the lendees argued that the issuance of an ex parte order for physical possession of their secured property was unconstitutionally entered. The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The lendees insisted that they were denied due process of law by the ex parte order directing the receiver to take physical possession of the secured property.

Defendant was charged with driving while intoxicated, but the trial court granted his motion to suppress the evidence. On appeal, however, the court reversed and remanded the trial court's order. The court held that the officer's stop of defendant's car was justified in light of either the tip or the equipment violation on defendant's car. The court also held that no probable cause for defendant's arrest was required when the PBT was administered because S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-1.2 permitted the administration of the test based on the officer's reasonable suspicion that defendant was driving while intoxicated. Finally, the court held that the PBT results could not be used as evidence against defendant but did provide the probable cause for defendant's submission to the blood tests, the results of which were admissible.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motions and also found that the action was late under the terms of the bond. On review, the court vacated the summary judgments because it noted that, in another case, &sect;15-2-9 had been ruled unconstitutional. Instead, it found that the statute of limitations at S.D. Codified Laws &sect;15-2-13(1) would apply and the date on which the cause of action accrued was a genuine issue of material fact. It also found that, with respect to the bondsman, the date final payment was due was also a genuine question of material fact for trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Seven issues were presented on appeal. In affirming the judgment in part, the court found because the proposed trans-state transmission it did not deliver more than 25 percent, it was to satisfy the fifth requirement set forth in S.D. Codified Laws &sect;49-41B-22, which effectively placed a burden on interstate commerce. However, that requirement added nothing to the protection of public health, safety and welfare that is not provided by the first four requirements. As a result, it violated the United States Constitution commerce clause and was unconstitutional. In reversing the judgment in part, the court found that the commission exceeded its statutory authority by imposing the H-frame requirement. The commission's authority in imposing conditions was limited to construction, operation or maintenance. The H-frame requirement was not such a condition. Also, the commission's decision was affirmed under an erroneous standard of review, and the use of the wrong standard of review mandated reversal.

It was issued in response to grievance and unfair practice charges that had been filed with the South Dakota Department of labor by, or on behalf of, such professionals pursuant to S.D.

The Board found that the attorney had been arrested on at least nine occasions in six years. Moreover, there were a number of unsatisfied civil judgments against him, involving child support, foreclosure, and assault. His history of employment indicated that he lacked stability and that he was not able to maintain regular employment. His personal behavior, conduct, and demeanor since his resignation were not in keeping with the conduct required of a member of the bar. Additionally, since the bar was not a labor union as the attorney contended, the court concluded that requiring membership in the bar in order to practice law was not violative of the right to work provision of S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2. The findings of the Board were affirmed and the petition for readmission was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims were either workers or passengers in the elevator when it exploded. An investigation determined that a steel pipe had eroded and that propane leaked into the perforations causing the explosion. The victims filed personal injury actions against appellees in 1981. Appellees filed motions for summary judgment relying on the provisions of S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 15-2-9 and 15-2-12.1. Section 15-2-9 provided that actions for personal injury arising out of any deficiency in the construction or improvement to real property had to be filed within six years of substantial completion of the project. Section 15-2-12.1 provided that any action filed after the six years limitation period was barred. The damaged pipe was installed in 1970. The trial court granted appellees' motions for summary judgment, and the victims sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that &sect;&sect; 15-2-9 and 15-2-12.1 were unconstitutional because the statutes were violative of, and repugnant to, constitutional provisions insuring citizenry of open courts. Essentially, the statutes attempted to bar actions that had yet to accrue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, banking and insurance groups, filed an independent proceeding challenging the constitutionality of 1983 S.D. Laws ch. 356, popularly know before passage as SB 256, a new law regulating the banking industry, against defendant State. Plaintiffs contended that the bill embraced more than one subject in the title, that the bill was not properly passed, that it was a delegation of authority, and that it violated due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">SB 256 regulated the ownership of banks and subsidiaries. The court dismissed the complaint. The court held that the new law did not violate S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 21, which banned bills covering more than one subject and required that the subject be expressed in the title. The title could have referred to &quot;banks&quot; while subsections related to various banking activities because all of the subsections were subsidiary provisions. There was only one general subject. SB 256 did not violate the constitutional provision that required that every bill be read twice because the legislature passed a &quot;modified enrolled bill&quot; that held that the enrolled bill was conclusive of a proper enactment. The legislature did not delegate authority to Congress by using the same definition for a &quot;bank holding company&quot; as a federal law. It was lawful to reference existing federal definitions. There was no violation of due process because the new law was allegedly hastily enacted essentially because the legislature had the power to pass legislation, and it was not the function of the courts to intrude on that power simply because the legislation was enacted in a manner contrary to plaintiffs' wishes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' complaint was dismissed. SB 256 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and defendant appealed. The United States Supreme Court reversed and remanded. The court held that defendant's refusal was evidence of a testimonial nature and was within the protection of the privilege against self-incrimination. The court found that because the test was not compelled and defendant had an option to submit to the test, the admission of his refusal was not prohibited by the constitutional protection against self-incrimination. The court reversed its previous holding and found that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-10.1 was constitutional. However, the court affirmed the trial court's holding that defendant's refusal was inadmissible because the arresting officer only partially informed defendant of the consequences of refusal. The court found that since defendant was not fully informed of the consequences, he did not voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waive his constitutional protection of due process and prohibition against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insureds challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit, Minnehaha County (South Dakota), which denied the insureds attorney's fees in a declaratory judgment action filed by appellee insurer. The insurer had filed the action to determine whether the insureds were entitled to legal representation from the insurer with regard to an automobile tort action filed against the insureds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer denied that the insureds were covered, but it agreed to provide counsel for them until the coverage question was resolved. The trial court held that the insureds were entitled to representation and indemnity from the insurer in the tort action. The insureds' attorney requested attorney fees pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 58-12-3. On appeal, the court held that whether the insurer was the named plaintiff and the insureds the named defendants was not dispositive of attorney's fees liability. The court found that taking the initiative to have liability determined did not occlude the insurer's responsibility to pay attorney's fees if its refusal to pay according to the policy was found to be vexatious or without reasonable cause. Further, the court ruled that although the pleadings for declaratory judgment did not contain a specific allegation of the insurer's refusal to pay, it was insufficient to negate an attorney's fees award under &sect; 58-12-3. The court noted that the insureds, in order to secure the policy benefits, were obliged to hire counsel and defend the action. The court indicated that &sect; 58-12-3 was intended to protect them because they had to do that.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of attorney's fees to the insureds.

The truck contained defendants, two rifles, and a shotgun. The officer arrested defendants and the circuit court granted their motion to dismiss, finding &sect; 41-8-17 void. The State appealed and defendants asserted that &quot;any animal&quot; and the &quot;possession or control&quot; language were unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. In reversing, the court held that protection of wild game animals was clearly within the State's police power, that defendants failed to assert that &sect; 41-8-17 affected their First Amendment liberties, and that it was unable to discern any possible arbitrary First Amendment suppression inherent in &sect; 41-8-17. The court held that &quot;any animal&quot; in &sect; 41-8-17 meant &quot;any game animal.&quot; Finally, defendants' argument that they failed to have possession or control of the three loaded firearms removed from the pickup truck was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer bought controlled drugs from defendant on three occasions.

Defendant argued that the trial court should have suppressed the evidence from the search and that the sentences he received were cruel and unusual punishment. Holding that the search was constitutional, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. The information in the warrants was not stale because the magistrate, in issuing the warrant, could properly infer from the officer's affidavits that the drug transactions were of a continuing nature. However, the court struck the life sentences and remanded for re-sentencing because the sentence was too harsh for the gravity of the offenses involved.. Defendant's life sentence accomplished the accepted goals of punishment of retribution and deterrence, but not the goal of rehabilitation. In light of the fact that defendant's prior offenses were against property rights, the court found that it was contrary to the goal of criminal justice to deny any effort at rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Circuit Court of the First Judicial Circuit, Charles Mix County (South Dakota) found defendant guilty of passing a check against a nonexistent account and of being a habitual offender based upon eight prior felony convictions. The judge sentenced defendant to 30 years in the penitentiary, pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-7-8. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he should have been sentenced under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-7-7 rather than &sect; 22-7-8, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction, and that his sentence was excessive. The court disagreed and upheld the convictions and the sentence. The fact that the habitual offender information alleged a violation of &sect; 22-7-7 (one or two prior felony convictions) did not preclude the circuit court from sentencing defendant under &sect; 22-7-8 (three or more prior felony convictions). The information referenced prior convictions numbering far in excess of three and complied with &sect; 22-7-11, which did not require recitation of the statute that defendant allegedly violated. Further, the circuit court advised defendant of the possibility of a life sentence under the three prior felony convictions rule. The State's witness unequivocally identified defendant as the individual who passed the bad check, and the jury disbelieved defendant's alibi witnesses. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction. Given defendant's prior felony convictions, a 30-year sentence that allowed for the possibility of parole was not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were licensed by the Department to engage in retail and wholesale sales of permissible fireworks. During the off-season appellants required over-the-counter purchasers to show proof that they were not South Dakota residents. The court affirmed the order permanently enjoining appellants from selling permissible fireworks over-the-counter to non-resident purchasers without verification that the purchasers were licensed fireworks wholesalers, manufacturers, or permit holders. The court agreed with the Department's and the lower court's interpretation of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 34-37-12 that the statute included all non-residents. Further, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, as a person of common intelligence did not have to guess at the meaning of its language but would interpret it in conformity with the lower court's and the Department's interpretation. Nor did &sect; 34-37-12 represent an invalid exercise of police power or amount to a taking of property without just compensation because the nature of fireworks made regulation necessary and the court would not substitute its judgment on the matter for that of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed the minor holding a plastic bag containing gold paint. As the officer approached, the minor threw the bag. The officer detected a strong paint odor coming from the minor's breath. He also saw gold paint on the minor's nostrils, lips, and fingers. He concluded that the minor was intoxicated. He arrested him and took him to a detoxification center. The minor contended that the statute was void for vagueness and unconstitutionally overbroad. The court disagreed and upheld the orders below. Because the challenge to the statute did not encompass First Amendment rights, the court confined its review of the contentions to the specific facts of the case. The court opined that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-42-15 was clearly limited to substances capable of creating &quot;intoxication,&quot; as defined by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-1-2(19). Because the harmful conduct of becoming intoxicated by inhaling paint fumes could have been understood by an ordinary person as prohibited by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-42-15, such statute was not void for vagueness. Moreover, &sect; 22-42-15 had not swept into its ambit constitutionally protected actions. Thus, the overbreadth argument was also rejected.</SPAN></P>

Codified Laws &sect; 22-42-15 and, following a hearing, adjudicated a delinquent. The proceedings arose after an officer observed the minor, with others, sitting in a vacant lot inhaling intoxicants, namely, gold paint contained in bags and cans. While the minor admitted that he had inhaled paint fumes, he contended that he did not inhale it to become intoxicated. On appeal, the minor asserted that the statute was unconstitutional under the void-for-vagueness doctrine and under the overbreadth doctrine. The court disagreed, noting that the statute made the intentional inhalation of substances for the purpose of becoming intoxicated a misdemeanor. While the minor did not claim a violation of any rights under U.S. Const. amend. I, the court limited its review of the vagueness and overbreadth contentions to the facts of the case. The minor's harmful conduct of becoming intoxicated by inhaling paint fumes could be understood by anyone as being statutorily prohibited. Moreover, the statute was not arbitrarily enforced. Finally, the court could not conclude that the statute impacted constitutionally protected actions.</SPAN></P>

At 9:00 p.m., the proprietor of the drug store went to the store to fill a prescription. He heard a noise in the double ceiling of the store and left to call the police. The police arrived. When the druggist went back in he found that his drug drawer had been broken into, controlled drugs taken, the garbage can dumped, and the plastic liner removed. Defendant was discovered hiding in the drug store's second floor shortly after the burglary. He was sweating and bleeding. His hiding place was a short distance from the hole in the ceiling used to enter the drug store. The missing drugs and garbage can liner were found in the trunk of a car in which defendant had ridden. Defendant was convicted of first-degree burglary, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the words of &quot;structure&quot; and &quot;crime&quot; as used in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-32-1(3), was not vague. &quot;Structure&quot; was clearly defined in S.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioners adopted a resolution, and sufficient referendum petitions were filed with the county auditor to refer the matter to the voters for approval or rejection. The commissioners refused to refer the matter, and the voter sought review. The circuit court found that &sect; 7-18A-15, providing for such referral, was unconstitutional. The voter sought further review, and the court held that the circuit court proceeded to final judgment absent a necessary party because the attorney general had a right to intervene in an action challenging the constitutionality of an act of the legislature, while no notice of the action was served upon him. The court further held that &sect; 7-18a-15 was not an unconstitutional infringement on the legislative power granted under S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, reasoning that while the statute specifically extended the referendum procedure to municipalities rather than counties, the doctrine of &quot;expressio unius est exclusio alterius&quot; did not preclude the referendum procedure where the action in question was made by county commissioners.

Under the distribution in lieu of tax ratios, the district would have received in excess of 60 percent of a payment. The district did not share in these funds because defendants refused to honor S.D.

The issue before the court was whether &sect; 5-11-6 conflicted with 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1601 and whether &sect; 5-11-6 violated the Supremacy Clause. The court assumed in ruling that the reserved powers of the States were not superseded by federal legislation absent the clear intent of the U.S. Congress.

Defendant had pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of mental illness to the stabbing death of his estranged wife's male friend. The trial court sentenced defendant to 100 years in prison and suspended 75 years of the term on several conditions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that defendant could be committed to a mental hospital if he was found not guilty by reason of mental illness.

The court opined that commitment was not mandatory in South Dakota. Defendant also claimed that the trial court erred in failing to adopt three instructions relating to justifiable homicide in defense of a person's child. The court held that the jury was sufficiently instructed on the justifiable homicide defense in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-16-35. The court held that, while defendant offered to stipulate to the victim's identity, that concession did not deprive the state of the right to put photographs of the victim in evidence. In the court's view, the trial court's provision for a revocation of defendant's sentence for the nonpayment of court-appointed counsel fees was not unconstitutional.

The complaint alleged that the defects and deficiencies were not discovered for 10 years. The trial court dismissed the action on the basis of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 15-2-9. The district appealed. The court affirmed because the constitutional issues raised by the district were already considered and rejected. In addition, the legislature did not intend that there would be disparate treatment of parties depending upon whether the injury was to body or in fisc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of the First Judicial Circuit, Charles Mix County (South Dakota), which convicted him of one count of second-degree murder pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-16-7 and two counts of aggravated assault pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-18-1.1(1). Defendant was sentenced to mandatory life imprisonment without parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-16-7 was unconstitutionally vague. He argued that the language in &sect; 22-16-7 was not susceptible to accurate definition and that the language in &sect; 22-16-7 defined criminal behavior that was easily confused with S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-16-15(3) that defined first-degree manslaughter. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-16-7 gave fair notice of what conduct was forbidden. Further, the court found that the &quot;depraved mind&quot; requirement was a genuine additional element that had to be established in order to prosecute for second-degree murder. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on diminished capacity due to intoxication. Because second-degree murder under &sect; 22-16-7 was a general intent crime, the trial court correctly determined that the voluntary intoxication diminished capacity instruction was not proper. Defendant further argued that the statutory scheme of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-6-1, which required life imprisonment for Class B felonies, constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court found that the punishment was not disproportionate to the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the guardian ad litem for two minor children, sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit, Pennington County, South Dakota, which granted summary judgment to defendant social workers in the guardian's action alleging that the social workers were negligent in their placement and supervision of the children in a foster home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The social workers received reports that the foster parents were abusing the children, both physically and sexually. Despite the reports, the social workers left the children in the home for approximately two years. The children were subsequently returned to their natural mother, and they informed their mother of the abuse. The foster father was thereafter convicted of raping and molesting the children. The children's guardian filed suit against the social workers, alleging that they were negligent in the performance of their duties. The social workers filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the suit was barred under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The trial court granted summary to the social workers. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the sovereign immunity doctrine did not bar the suit. The court determined that the suit exposed the social workers to individual liability and, therefore, that it was not barred as an action against the state itself. The court also found that the social workers' placement and supervision of children in foster care was a routine, ministerial function and, therefore, that they were not entitled to immunity in their official capacities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment to the social workers and remanded the case for a trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was driving a state-owned vehicle when she was involved in a collision with plaintiffs. The trial court granted a summary judgment in the employee's favor based on sovereign immunity. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court determined that the case was not barred as an action against the state under sovereign immunity because no relief was sought against the state nor was there any allegation that the state negligently maintained the vehicle. Because the allegations against the employee related to her individual negligence, the court found that she was not sued in her official capacity. As liability did not arise from one of the employee's discretionary functions and would not impact her employer, the court held that the employee's actions in operating the vehicle were ministerial in nature rather than discretionary and, thus, sovereign immunity did not extend to her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer brought an appeal of a determination of appellee, the South Dakota Department of Revenue, not to allow the taxpayer a tax refund on sales taxes already collected. The taxpayer challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of the fifth Judicial Circuit, Brown County, South Dakota, which affirmed the Department's decision to deny the taxpayer a claim for a refund of sales taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchase price of the taxpayer's roller skating tickets included the retail sales tax as an element of the purchase price. From 1975 through 1980, the taxpayer paid one percent higher in sales tax than the statutory rate. Thus, it applied for a tax refund. The basis of the Department's denial of a tax refund was that Senate Bill 40 (1981), which amended the sales tax upward by one percent, was upheld as constitutional in its retroactive application to 1969. The taxpayer asserted that the rule that where the excess taxes paid by utilities had been passed on to its customers who had shared in the public benefits of those collected taxes, the retroactive application of the statute increasing the retail sales tax by one percent was constitutional, was not applicable where the retailer did not collect the tax directly from the consumer. The court affirmed the judgment. The taxpayer did collect the sales tax from the consumer in its ticket sales. The taxpayer was improperly focusing on the economic incidence of the retroactive tax, rather than on its legal incidence. The retroactive effect of the sales tax law was constitutional, and such law applied in the action at bar.</SPAN></P>

The court found that, with the consent of the parties, the action was properly submitted to a jury for a binding verdict under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 15-6-39(c). Considering the special relationship that the benefactors had with the decedent and the questionable and profitable transactions, the court concluded that there was substantial evidence to submit the case to the jury and to deny a motion for directed verdict. The court found that the benefactors had submitted insufficient evidence to support jury instructions on the receipt of independent legal advice and that the decedent's perfunctory consultations with an attorney were insufficient to rebut the presumption of undue influence.

Telephone calls could be deemed anonymous within the meaning of &sect; 49-31-31(4), where the receiving party recognized the voice of the calling party. The evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. Section 49-31-31(4) was not vague nor overbroad. The sentences imposed did not constitute excessive, cruel, or unusual punishment. Although defendant's sentences of one year on each count, the sentences to be served consecutively, represented the maximum incarceration that could have been imposed, the sentences were within statutory limits, inasmuch as S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-6-6.1 authorized consecutive sentences. The court found that defendant waived his right to a presentence report, provided by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-27-5, and waived the 48-hour waiting period for sentencing, provided by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-27-1.</SPAN></P>

The injured person conceded that her action was barred under the terms of the statute, but contended that the statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, after noting that the injured person bore the burden of demonstrating the unconstitutionality of the statute, the court affirmed its constitutionality. The court held that &sect; 15-2-9 did not violate the injured person's right to equal protection under S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 23 and S.D. Const. art.

Defendant threatened, pushed, and hit the deputy. He aimed a shotgun at the deputy. Defendant and his brother were later arrested at their farm. Two guns were found behind the kitchen door. The trial court convicted defendant of aggravated assault. The court affirmed. An emergency or exigent circumstances did not justify the search. Defendant and his brother were in handcuffs in the patrol car when the sheriff and the deputy entered the house. The court held that the evidence obtained was the result of unreasonable search and seizure. Nevertheless, the admission of the evidence was harmless error. Because of eyewitness evidence, the only significance of the seized shotgun and shells was to show that the gun used in the assault was likely loaded. The record was devoid of evidence that would raise the issue of simple assault but not aggravated assault. The trial court did not err in refusing to instruct on &sect; 22-18-1(4) as a lessor included offense.

The circuit court found that complaints were received that the teacher spent too much time discussing the theories of creation and evolution, and that the school board limited the time he spent on the conflict he perceived between the theories of creation and evolution. The circuit court further found that the school board did not forbid the teacher from discussing the differences between the theories of creation and evolution, but that it objected to the excessive time the teacher spent on the subject.

She appealed and claimed that it was error for the trial court to include an order of suspension of imposition of sentence which occurred prior to the passage of the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-7-8, when the trial court determined the number of her prior felonies. The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the sentence as a fourth offender did not make the statute invalidly retroactive. The sentence as a habitual offender was not a new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes. Rather, it was a stiffened penalty for the last crime which was considered to be an aggravated offense because it was a repetitive one.

The court held that the conviction for commission of a felony while armed required proof of an element that the manslaughter conviction did not and that therefore no double jeopardy violation occurred. In addition, the court noted that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-14-13 was a gun control statute that mandated additional punishment if a firearm was used in the perpetration of the predicate felony.

Section 49-31-31(1) was not an obscenity statute and the constitutional standards of Roth did not apply. The terms were used to describe a type of &quot;epithet,&quot; that is, an obscene adjective, a vulgarity, a profanity or, in plain terms, &quot;cuss words.&quot; In dealing with a prohibition against obscene phone calls, the court used the everyday meaning of the word &quot;obscene,&quot; in other words, lewd, impure, filthy, and offensive to modesty or decency. The State had a legitimate interest in regulating and prohibiting the intrusion into the home by means of telecommunications of those individuals who intended to terrify, harass, annoy, and abuse the listener by means of the language proscribed by statute.&nbsp;Section 49-31-31(1) was not unconstitutionally vague. Further, calling the victim a &quot;no good fucking whore,&quot; a &quot;sleazy slut,&quot; and &quot;slut,&quot; was patently offensive, base, and the type of utterance that &sect; 49-31-31(1) was designed to prohibit.</SPAN></P>

Evidence was suppressed because arresting officers failed to advise defendant that the refusal evidence could be used against him at trial, the refusal was irrelevant to the issues before the court, and S.D.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant failed to stop for a stop sign two police officers stopped defendant and gave him field sobriety tests. Defendant was advised of his Miranda rights and asked to submit to a blood alcohol test. Defendant was warned that his failure to submit could result in the revocation of his driver's license. Defendant refused to take the test and filed a motion to suppress evidence of his refusal. At the suppression hearing, prosecution witnesses testified to his refusal and to his statement, &quot;I'm too drunk, I won't pass the test.&quot; The circuit court ordered the evidence of defendant's refusal suppressed, finding that S.D.

The court affirmed on appeal, holding that the statute was a violation of defendant's federal and state constitutional privilege against self-incrimination under U.S. Const. amend. V and S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9. There was an absolute right under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-10 to refuse to submit to the blood test and a defendant's exercise of this right could not be used against him in the prosecution's case in chief. However, the court remanded for findings regarding the voluntariness of defendant's statement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother commenced an action by filing a complaint that alleged that appellee was the biological father of her minor child. Accompanying the complaint was an assignment of child support rights from the mother to the state in return for certain benefits. Subsequent to a probable cause hearing and various filings by the parties, the father signed an affidavit of paternity. The trial court ordered the father to pay child support until the child turned 16. On appeal, the court modified the order and determined that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-8-29 violated the equal protection rights of illegitimate children. The court found that the statute created an arbitrary classification between illegitimate and legitimate children because the parents of legitimate children were required to provide support until the children turned 18. The court concluded that there was no permissible legislative purpose, which bore a substantial relationship to the classification of legitimate and illegitimate children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the theft of a horse trailer. An accomplice testified that she, a third party, and defendant took the trailer. Another witness testified that she observed a black and white pickup pull a horse trailer onto her farm. She identified the three passengers in the pickup as two men and a woman. One of the men she further identified by name as the third party described by the accomplice. The witness phoned the sheriff, and defendant was apprehended. On appeal, defendant claimed the testimony of the witness was not sufficient corroboration of the testimony of the accomplice. The court disagreed and held that accomplice testimony need not be corroborated by evidence sufficient to sustain a conviction. Rather, the corroborating evidence must tend to affirm the truth of the testimony of the accomplice and establish the guilt of the defendant. The court held that there was sufficient corroborating evidence presented by the prosecution pursuant to S.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees worked for a school under the Board of Regents' jurisdiction. After they were discharged, the employees filed a grievance, seeking relief from the school's superintendent. The relief was denied, and the employees appealed to the Commission of Higher Education. The Board of Regents then assumed jurisdiction and denied relief to the employees. On the employees' request for review, the Personnel Board assumed jurisdiction of the grievance under S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 3-6A-37, 3-6A-38 and ruled for the employees. The trial court vacated that decision. On appeal, the court held that pursuant to the power granted in S.D. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8, the legislature's reorganization of the executive branch included the Board of Regents within the personnel management functions transferred to the bureau of personnel provided for in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 3-6A-12. The court also held that the Personnel Board had jurisdiction to hear the grievance where the Board of Regents was part of the executive branch of government and where thus S.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee applied to the Department for a license to broker new motor vehicles pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-6-1. This application was denied due to the employee's failure to comply with S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 32-6-4.1 and 32-6-5, which required the broker to obtain a franchise or contract with each manufacturer whose vehicles he brokered and to have adequate repair facilities. The broker was in the business of selling new motor vehicles through individual brokers located throughout the United States. These brokers solicited orders and submitted them to the broker. The court found that to require the broker to maintain adequate repair facilities as required by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-6-4.1 would greatly burden its operation. Similarly, the requirement in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-6-5 that the broker procure a franchise with every manufacturer from which it purchased vehicles would impede the broker's ability to effectively conduct business. These requirements had no discernible local public benefit. Therefore, S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-6-4.1 and 32-6-5 were unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 46-18-38 and 46-18-42 granted the Board only ministerial power to approve the subdistrict's budgets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a subdistrict submitted its budget to the Board for approval, the Board reduced the amount proposed for a fund that was to be used to fund four contracts. The subdistrict sued, and the trial court entered judgment for the Board. On appeal, the court held that because S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 2-14-1 required that words in a statute had to be understood in their ordinary sense, and because &quot;approval&quot; implied discretion, the Board had discretionary power under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 46-18-38 to approve the subdistrict's contracts, and under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 46-18-42 to approve the subdistrict's budget to determine if they were acceptable in substance, not merely proper in form. Such discretion was not an improper delegation of legislative power in violation of S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 because related statutes provided understandable standards to guide the Board in the exercise of its power. The Board's power to make or supervise projects involving natural resources and to levy taxes did not violate S.D. Const. art. III, 26 because the Board was not a special commission but performed the functions of the former South Dakota Conservancy District, a governmental agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants objected to the state's expending the proceeds of an additional tax imposed on gasoline and other liquid motor fuels for the operation and maintenance of the struggling rail lines in the State of South Dakota. The state officials maintained that the appropriation of such funds to the railroads fell within the scope of S.D. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8 because another state constitutional provision, S.D. Const. art. XVII, &sect; 15, provided that certain railways were &quot;public highways.&quot; The court found that in reading the amendment to S.D. Const. art.

Therefore, the court declared the appropriation measure set forth at &sect; 36 of H.B. 1376 (S.D. 1981) to be unconstitutional to the extent it diverted proceeds of an additional fuel tax used in on-highway motor vehicles to railroad operation and maintenance, which tax was codified at S.D.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former class action litigant (litigant) brought suit against respondents, state officials and utilities, challenging legislation which retroactively amended S.D.

The litigant claimed that the legislation impermissibly stripped him of an absolute, vested right to recover for the sales tax overcharges that the act attempted to ratify. The court held that it did not. The court ruled that when the sales taxes were improperly exacted, the legislature undoubtedly possessed the power to authorize their imposition and, therefore, the legislature possessed the power to ratify the transactions. The court also rejected the argument that the legislation violated the Contract Clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The court ruled that prior illegal collection of the tax did not arise from an inherent want of power in the state, but simply from the failure to delegate to the Department of Revenue the authority essential to give immediate validity of its actions.

The tenant paid rent and placed cattle on the land. The landlords sued. The trial court permitted the landlords to amend their complaint and awarded judgment to them. The tenant appealed. The landlords were properly allowed to amend their complaint. The amendment was not prejudicial because the original complaint gave the tenant sufficient notice that the action was being brought under S.D.

Section 21-16-1(7) was not unconstitutionally vague because it was explicit in that it expressed that a tenant that violated a lease termination provision was subject to forcible entry and detainer. Section 21-16-1(7) was not violative of due process because the tenant could have posted a surety bond and obtained a continuance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was commenced against the parents after social workers received information that one of the parents' children had suffered extensive burns. One expert contended that the burns were caused by immersion in hot water. The mother claimed that she tripped and accidentally knocked hot water on the child. The child was also found to have a dislocated shoulder and was not properly immunized. The court upheld the trial court's determination. The trial court's conclusion that the child was a dependent and neglected child was not clearly erroneous based on expert testimony that the burns on the child were caused intentionally by the mother. The trial court was not required to comply with S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 26-8-23. The trial court did not err in terminating both parents' parental rights. The child's injuries were severe and testimony indicated that the injuries were intentionally inflicted. The trial court did not err by admitting into evidence three written reports/evaluations during the adjudicatory phase of the proceedings. The documents were admissible under &sect; 19-16-10. The court rejected the mother's attacks on the constitutionality of &sect; 26-8-36.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents contended that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 26-8-6, under which their children were declared dependent, denied them due process of law because it was unconstitutionally vague, that they were denied due process of law because S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 26-8-22.5 did not prescribe a sufficient evidentiary standard in proving dependency or neglect, and that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of dependency. The court held that, as to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 26-8-6, it had previously upheld the constitutionality of the state in the light of similar contentions. As to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 26-8-22, the court had previously held that the preponderance of the evidence standard called for under the statute was constitutional and there was no need to deviate from that position. Finally, where the trial court found that one parent was seriously ill, the other was mentally deficient, the children were developmentally retarded and emotionally disturbed because of frequent changes in residence and improper care and that they were also sexually dysfunctional because of sexual encounters with the parents, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of dependency.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's conviction was affirmed on appeal. Defendant was convicted as the result of a second trial, which followed a mistrial. The court found that the reprosecution of defendant did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy under U.S. Const. amend V and S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9. The court found that the events that precipitated defendant's mistrial motion did not constitute the judicial or prosecutorial overreaching that properly invoked the double jeopardy bar to reprosecution. The court also found, in response to defendant's allegation that he was so incapacitated by the use of Mace upon him that he could not have assaulted the arresting officer, that the trial court had not abused its discretion in allowing expert testimony from a prosecution witness who stated that, although he had no technical knowledge of the effects of mace, Mace victims could be aggressive, even while intoxicated. The expert's testimony was based on his experience in using it on others and himself. The court found that the worth and weight of such testimony was ultimately for the jury.</SPAN></P>

He allegedly discovered the pin on his second visit with a doctor in another clinic after an X-ray. That doctor did not remove or recommend removal of the pin, finally, the patient's family doctor removed it, relieving the pain. Just over a year after the X-ray, the patient filed suit. The patient claimed that &sect; 15-2-14.1 was unconstitutionally denial him due process because it did not include a discovery rule, and that it was enacted after the alleged malpractice date. On review, the court found that the record showed no final act to commence the running of any statute of limitation, and that the record was insufficient to establish whether or not the caregivers obtained the patient's informed consent to leave the pin in his knee. It found it impossible to determine whether the caregivers intended to remove the pin, whether they informed the patient of the pin, or what their intent was with regard to removal.</SPAN></P>

The mother asserted on appeal that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 15-7-2(8) (1978) gave the trial court jurisdiction over the father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1979, the mother filed a paternity action against the father alleging that he fathered her child in South Dakota in 1976. At the time the action was filed, the father lived in Nebraska. He filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over him and there was insufficient service of process. Although &sect; 15-7-2(1) through (6) were enacted in 1965, &sect; 15-7-2(8), on which jurisdiction over the father depended, was not enacted until 1978. The trial court found that because &sect; 15-7-2(8) was not in effect at the time the parties had intercourse, it did not provide personal jurisdiction over the father who was a non-resident. On appeal, the mother asserted that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 15-7-4 (1965), which gave retroactive effect to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 15-7-2(1) through (6) (1965) applied to &sect; 15-7-2(8) also, even though &sect; 15-7-2(8) was not in effect until 1978. The court agreed, holding that S.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the guardian ad litem (GAL) for a minor child, filed a class action against defendant state officials in which the GAL sought a writ of mandamus, a permanent injunction, and declaratory relief in relation to the issuance of amended birth certificates to illegitimate children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On his birth certificate, the child's last name was that of his mother. After the GAL, who was the child's father, acknowledged paternity, an amended birth certificate was issued in which the child's last name was changed to that of the GAL. The court rejected the GAL's argument that when paternity of a child was acknowledged by affidavit, the state was required to issue a new birth certificate rather than an amended one. It stated that the statutes contained in S.D. Codified Laws ch. 34-25, governing vital records, provided for new birth certificates only upon legitimation of a child or upon adoption of a child. Next, the court held that the prohibition of the issuance of a new birth certificate to an illegitimate child upon acknowledgement of paternity did not violate due process or equal protection. The court stated that under South Dakota law, not all children with amended birth certificates were illegitimate and not all illegitimate children had amended birth certificates. Therefore, the statutory scheme did not classify on the basis of legitimacy and did not treat legitimate children differently than legitimate children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants in a criminal case filed a motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant. The Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit, Hughes County, South Dakota, granted the order on the grounds that the deputy sheriff executing the warrant had not complied with S.D. Consolidated Laws &sect; 23A-35-8, the &quot;knock-and-announce&quot; statute. The State filed an intermediate appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residence to be searched had an enclosed porch attached to the front. Entry to the porch was obtained through a screen door. The deputy sheriff who was serving the warrant opened the screen door without first knocking, entered the porch, and approached the front door to the living quarters. This door was open. The deputy saw two people in the living room. The deputy entered the living room and announced his purpose to execute the search warrant almost simultaneously with his entry, although he could not recall whether the announcement was made before or after he stepped into the living room. The court stated that because the deputy complied or clearly intended to comply with the statute at the front door to the living area, it was not necessary that he comply with the statute before entering the porch through the screen door. The porch here did not appear to be an integral portion of the living area of the residence, but more in the nature of a foyer or natural entranceway for the general public. Next, in announcing his intention to execute the search warrant nearly simultaneously with his entry into the living room, the deputy had substantially complied with the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee operated and managed the marina as lessee from the State. The sublessee sought to rent marina slip space for his boat. The lessee refused to rent him slip space. The lessee claimed the sublessee had not paid his previous year's bill in full. The sublessee contested the charge. The trial court found that the marina was a public concession controlled by the State. The trial court found that the lessee's refusal to rent to the sublessee was an unfair and discriminatory practice under S.D. Codified Laws &sect;20-13-1(14) and found that the refusal violated the protection afforded by S.D. Codified Laws &sect;20-13-23. The court held that the sublessee's claim was not properly before it under S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect;1-26-1(1) (as amended), 1-26-30, 20-13-2.1, 20-13-23, 20-13-46, and 20-13-47 because the sublessee had failed to presented his grievance to the State Commission on Human Rights and because that failure to exhaust administrative remedies should have prompted the trial court to send the matter back for an administrative hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an oil company and its driver, sought review of a summary judgment of the Circuit Court of the Fifth Judicial Circuit, Brown County (South Dakota). The trial court held in favor of appellee Director and State Highway Engineer of the Division of Highways for the State of South Dakota in the driver's negligence action arising from a vehicular crash in which he was seriously injured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver lost control of his vehicle and collided with another vehicle, seriously injuring a passenger in the other vehicle. Appellants settled the passenger's claim and then sued appellee as a joint tortfeasor, alleging that appellee was legally liable to contribute to the settlement because the reverse S curve in the road was designed or modified negligently. The Director pled governmental immunity, asserting that the proper party was the State. The court affirmed. In an action against an officer of the State where the State was the real party against which relief was sought, and where a judgment for the complaining party could subject the State to liability, the action was against the State and was not maintainable unless the State had consented to be sued. The Director had not acted outside the scope of his employment. Under S.D. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 9, construction and maintenance of public highways were functions of state government, and any action on the Director's part in the performance of his duties, whether negligently done or otherwise, was constitutional. The purchase of liability insurance coverage did not constitute a waiver of governmental immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association contended that the Board's findings and conclusions were clearly erroneous. They disputed the basis of the Board's finding, contending that the aquifer in the area of the proposed well field was declining. The court affirmed the judgment, agreeing with the trial court that, upon consideration of the factors before the Board, the record was sufficient to support the Board's conclusion that water was available for appropriation. Consequently, the court could not conclude that substantial rights of the association had been prejudiced. The association further contended that the Board abused its discretion and rendered an arbitrary decision. The court determined that the record did not support the association's claim. Rather, the court found that the Board exhibited sincere concern for the rights of existing well owners in the affected area and its commitment to protect those interests. Further, the Board's concern was evidenced by the strict conditions attached to the decision to grant the application. Thus, the court concluded that the administrative findings of the Board were not characterized by an abuse or unwarranted exercise of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Law enforcement officers armed with an arrest warrant that was later conceded to be invalid entered defendant's trailer house where they arrested him. During the course of the arrest, one of the officers observed drug paraphernalia in the living room. Based upon these observations, the officer later signed an affidavit and was issued a search warrant for the trailer. A search of the trailer resulted in the seizure of evidence that formed the basis of the charges of possession of controlled substances. The court rejected defendant's contention that separate trials of the distribution and possession charges should have been ordered. Evidence regarding the several charges was sufficiently simple and distinct and so readily referable to the separate offenses as to reduce to the point of insubstantiality the hazard that the jury would use the evidence cumulatively to convict defendant of all of the charges. However, defendant's conviction on the possession charges was reversed because that conviction was based on evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant that was based on information obtained during an arrest that could not be justified by the existence of exigent circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction on the charge of distribution of a controlled substance was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder. On appeal, defendant's conviction was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial. The court agreed with defendant that the trial court committed reversible error in denying defendant's motion to suppress statements made by defendant to a police officer during the course of three separate interrogations. The trial court erroneously found that defendant effectively waived his rights under the U.S. Const. amends. V, IV. According to the court, the State did not demonstrate a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel by defendant during the interrogations. The statements obtained throughout the course of these interrogations were highly prejudicial to defendant and were constitutionally inadmissible; these factors alone justified a reversal and remand for a new trial. The court rejected defendant's remaining arguments, holding that evidence obtained during a search was admissible because defendant consented to the search and that both the murder statutes under which defendant was convicted and a jury instruction pertaining to a permissible inference, were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

He argued that S.D. Codified Laws &sect;22-32-8 required unauthorized entry, the police officers failed to comply with S.D. Codified Laws &sect;23-22-9, and that his conviction should be reversed because he unconstitutionally was detained for 36 hours before being brought in front of a magistrate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant knew the police officers and the officers identified themselves as police; the police and pharmacy owner saw defendant on the premises; and he was seen exiting the pharmacy with flashlight in hand and with his companion carrying stolen goods. With a pistol trained on him, the officers commanded him to lie down; he complied, was handcuffed, and immediately transported by squad car to the county jail. In short, he was caught red-handed at the scene. Defendant knew he was under arrest and why. The officers acted reasonably and affirmatively; defendant's contentions were without merit. Circumstances, without expressed words, afforded defendant sufficient notice of the police officers' authority and the cause of the arrest as required by S.D. Codified Laws &sect;23-22-9. S.D. Codified Laws &sect;22-32-8 did not require any form of unauthorized entry by a person entering an unoccupied structure with intent to commit a crime therein; consent to enter was irrelevant to a charge of third-degree burglary. Delaying defendant's appearance before a magistrate for a period of 36 hours from the time of his arrest did not create a constitutional and jurisdictional defect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of the First Judicial Circuit, Yankton County (South Dakota), of aggravated assault under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-18-1.1(4) and was sentenced to one year in the state penitentiary. He appealed, claiming in part that the statute was impermissibly vague and that the circuit court should have instructed the jury on the definition of serious bodily injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's victim sustained bruises across his head, shoulders, and leg but showed no real damage to his face and no fractures or concussion. In considering defendant's appeal, the court ruled that the circuit court erred in submitting the case to the jury on a charge higher than simple assault. The court concluded that the victim's injuries were more closely related to the ordinary injuries sustained in a simple assault and were far below the status of grave or dangerous to life, health or limb as required by the term serious bodily injury in &sect; 22-18-1.1(4). The statute did not contain a definition of serious bodily injury, but the court ruled that it was able to supply the necessary definition. Comparing serious bodily injury to the great bodily injury required in the former version of the statute, the court also ruled that the crime of aggravated assault required more serious bodily injury than the kind of injury caused by a simple assault. Accordingly, the circuit court erred in submitting the case to the jury on a charge higher than simple assault. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment of conviction of aggravated assault to simple assault, and it remanded the case to the circuit court for resentencing of defendant in a manner not inconsistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

Two psychiatrists testified that he did not evidence any signs of psychosis or organic brain disorder. One expert characterized his mental condition at the time of the shooting as bordering on temporary insanity but that he was capable of knowing right from wrong. On appeal, the court applied the test under S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 22-3-1(3) and S.D.

The city brought an action against the owners for violation of its zoning ordinance and prayed for a mandatory injunction. The trial court found that the owners were not entitled to a variance. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that, although the owners were not given notice as required by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 11-4-21, it was conceded that the owners appeared before the board of adjustment when their request was reconsidered.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of sentence for the crime of uttering a no account check that was entered by the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit, Pennington County, South Dakota. After defendant entered a guilty plea and admitted to six previous felonies, the trial court adjudged defendant a habitual offender and sentenced him to life imprisonment under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-7-8 and S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-7-1(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that his life sentence constituted an abuse of discretion, a denial of his right to due process of law, and was cruel and unusual punishment. In affirming the judgment of sentence, the court rejected defendant's argument. At the outset, the court noted that the habitual offender statute had been declared constitutional. Moreover, the court found that the application of the life sentence provided for by the statute, though severe, was not so excessive that it shocked the conscience. In reaching this conclusion, the court noted that the present conviction for uttering a no account check represented defendant's seventh felony conviction, and that he had spent most of his adult life in prison. The court concluded that defendant's consistent failure to conform his behavior clearly qualified him as a &quot;habitual offender.&quot; Additionally, the court noted that the trial court advised him before the entry of the guilty plea that a life sentence was possible. The court concluded that defendant's unwillingness to learn from his mistakes justified the sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 9-24-2 simply stripped away some of state government's traditional immunity, and, therefore, the legislature's permission to sue in tort a previously immune sovereign could reasonably be accompanied by such terms and provisions as the legislature wished to impose upon that right and the statute was not unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with having sex with a child under the age of 15, which met the definition of rape under &sect; 22-22-1(4). Defendant argued that the intent of the statute was to create a presumption of incapacity of the child rather than a rule of substantive law. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the former case law providing that incapacity was a rebuttable presumption was based on the former &sect;22-22-1(4) (1975), which specifically provided that a child under the age of 16 was presumed incapable of consent. Because the current &sect; 22-22-1(4), amended in 1977, removed the presumption language, it was clearly intended to make a child under the age of 15 per se incapable of consent. However, the court reversed the sentence because the trial judge stated that defendant had previous convictions of rape of an eight-year-old and a 10-year child where the evidence did not establish that the convictions were for the crime of rape.</SPAN></P>

Shortly thereafter, the children were left with a 15-year-old girl who was unequipped to give care. The mother failed to return and the police were called. The children were removed from the home and released to their grandmother. A third incident occurred after a complaint was received and the home was again filthy and in shambles. A relative took the children to his home and the children were thereafter placed in foster care. On appeal, the court reiterated its holding that S.D.

As to the due process challenges, because the overriding concern was the best interests of the children and the proceedings were preventative as well as remedial, a preponderance of the evidence was all that was required.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipal residents brought an action against the subdistrict challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of its board of directors. They alleged that the apportionment system violated their rights under the due process and equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Their claim was based on the disparity between municipal and rural representation on the board. The trial court treated the subdistrict as a special purpose unit and applied the rational basis test rather than the strict scrutiny test. It found the apportionment unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in submitting to the jury the questions of whether the subdistrict's apportionment had a rational basis and was reasonably precise, as those were questions of law rather than issues of fact. The only issue of fact was the question of disproportionate impact on the rural landowners. The court reversed and remanded with directions to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law and a judgment based thereon from the entire record. The court also reversed the disallowance of costs and attorney fees properly assignable to the temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a writ of habeas corpus to respondents, a circuit court judge and the director of the human service center. Petitioner, a minor, had been found not competent to stand trial under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23A-10A-4 and had been ordered to report to the center pursuant to S. D. Codified Laws 23A-10A-8. The minor contended that his commitment violated due process of law. The court considered whether to quash the writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found that the minor was not competent to stand trial for murder. The circuit court ordered that the minor be committed to a human services center until he was found mentally competent to proceed. The minor sought a writ of habeas corpus, contending that his commitment violated the due process and equal protection clauses of both the federal and state constitutions. He asserted that the commitment was indeterminate and bore no rational relationship to a determination of his competency to stand trial, in part because his incompetency was due more to immaturity than a mental condition. The court initially issued the writ but later quashed it. The court determined that the evaluation procedures required by S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 27A-12-15 and 27A-12-16 provided a reasonable time period for review of the minor's mental condition and did not violate any of his constitutional rights. The state had a legitimate interest in determining an accused's mental competency to stand trial and could adopt reasonable measures for an inquiry.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was then found lying in a creek. Defendant was read his Miranda rights and his implied consent rights, and administered a breathalyzer test, which indicated he was intoxicated. On appeal, the court held there was insufficient evidence that the value of the car exceeded $ 200 and therefore, grand theft was not proven. The court held the witnesses who testified as to the value of the car were not familiar with the car in question. Accordingly, defendant's grand theft conviction was modified to petty theft. The court affirmed defendant's driving while intoxicated conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stole a vehicle and hit a parked car. A blood alcohol test showed a concentration of 0.34 percent. Defendant was then convicted of grand theft and DWI. On appeal, the court modified defendant's grand theft conviction to petty theft. The court held that the State did not meet its burden of showing that the car's fair market value exceeded $ 200 as required by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-30A-17 for a grand theft conviction. The State's expert witness had never seen the vehicle, and the teenage driver was not an expert. Further, only the vehicle owner could testify as to a sale price, so the driver's testimony as to an acceptable price was irrelevant. However, the court held that the trial court had broad discretion in submitting the question of specific intent to the jury. Although defendant was clearly intoxicated, the jury apparently was convinced that defendant was capable of forming intent. The court affirmed defendant's DWI conviction. The court held that the admission of defendant's two prior felony convictions was proper under S.D. R. Evid. 609, S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 19-14-12, because the evidence was not more probative than prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's boars entered plaintiff's property in September 1975 and infected his swine with two diseases, causing him to replace certain of these animals. In October 1977, plaintiff filed a trespass and negligence complaint against defendant, but the trial court dismissed the charges due to the expiration of the statute of limitations set forth in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 40-28-20. On appeal, the court affirmed, rejecting defendant's contention that the statutory provisions were merely cumulative, not exclusive, thereby permitting his negligence action to proceed. The statute, the court said, provided an exclusive remedy, not only for damages resulting from the trespass of animals, but also for such damages that accrued by reason of the trespass. The court further rejected defendant's contention that the statute was unconstitutional as violative of equal protection. Applying the rational basis test, the court ruled that all persons, whatever their classification, were bound by the statutory time limit, and that there was a rational basis between the time limit and a legitimate state purpose, namely, the prevention of stale claims after the evidence had been taken to market.</SPAN></P>

It further directed the county auditor to spread a levy in mills over the taxable property sufficient to raise the money requested. Respondents made their return on the alternative writ. The court dissolved the writ directed to the county board and granted the writ as to the county auditor. The court reasoned that the county board had the authority under S.D.

However, the county board's action was ultra vires and void because the percentage adopted was insufficient to meet the school board's fiscal needs.

The divorce was granted pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 25-4-2 on grounds of extreme cruelty, namely, the infliction of grievous mental suffering on the husband by the wife. On the wife's appeal, the court reversed, noting that the evidence of extreme cruelty did not approach the level required. The record showed that after the husband admitted to having been seeing his secretary, a relationship that was now allegedly over, the wife discovered a receipt for a diamond ring that the husband purchased for the other woman. At trial, the husband acknowledged that his relationship with the other woman was continuing. On the other hand, the husband complained that his wife inflicted grievous mental suffering upon him by being continuously suspicious of his activities away from home in that she checked on his whereabouts, his mileage, and the contents of his pockets. The trial court erred in finding extreme cruelty because suspicious as she might have been, the husband could hardly fault her for that given his admissions and her discoveries.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court disagreed with the inmate's argument that that the imposition of repayment of attorney fees as a condition of probation was unconstitutional in that any revocation of probation for failure to pay said fees would have been imprisonment for debt, which was prohibited by S.D.

The court held that the condition, if enforced, was not imprisonment for debt but was rather a sanction imposed for an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility company and a second company agreed to provide electric service in the city where the landowners lived. The actual service of the landowners' property went to the utility company. The PUC refused to approve the agreement, but the trial court reversed that decision upon appeal by the utility company. The court upheld the trial court's decision. The court rejected the landowners' contention that the utility company's appeal from the PUC order, and its notice of appeal from the order, was not timely. The trial court's determination that disapproval of the agreement between the utility companies as to the landowners' property constituted an abuse of discretion was correct. The undisputed evidence indicated that all of the statutory reasons for mandating approval of the agreement were clearly established. The court rejected the landowners' challenges to the constitutionality of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 49-34A, finding the law was not a special law in violation of S.D. Const. art.

The mother's rights were terminated after the trial court found that her children were dependent and neglected within the meaning of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 26-8-6. The mother argued that &sect;26-8-6 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the &quot;proper care&quot; standard of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 26-8-6 was vague and that even administration of the statute was impossible in a cross-cultural, cross-class situation. The court held that &sect;26-8-6, which defined a neglected or dependent child, provided adequate standards from which an average intelligent person could regulate his conduct. The court noted that the mother's was not a case where there was an unconscious projection of proper child rearing values of one culture and class upon a different and less materially endowed class. The court held that the fact that the mother was a Native American and poor did not excuse leaving her children unattended for days while she was on a drinking binge. The court also found no error in the trial court's denial of the mother's motion for a bill of particulars because the bill had no supporting affidavits or accompanying documents in support of it and it was not timely filed under &sect;15-6-6(d). The court detailed the efforts of the trial court and social services to help the mother keep her family together and concluded that the evidence supported the trial court's judgment that the children were neglected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer assisting in a game check stopped defendant as he approached the checkpoint.

The officer issued a citation for driving under revocation. The next day, the officer stopped defendant at the same check point. He recognized defendant and placed him under arrest for driving under revocation. Defendant was convicted of the charged offenses. The circuit court affirmed the convictions. On appeal, the court held that the game check stop was not an unreasonable seizure where there were several identifiable state vehicles at the checkpoint, where the only effective means of implementing S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 41-15-6 was by the use of road blocks or checkpoints in game areas, and where intrusion into a non-hunter's right to the uninterrupted use of the highways was outweighed by the public interest in wildlife management under S.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were married for more than 20 years, and the husband had a very successful business. The husband contested the trial court's order for a cash property distribution payable to the wife over several years with interest, support payments payable over 13 years, and attorney fees. The court affirmed the judgment, except for the attorney fees. The court found no abuse of discretion in the property division and support award, and concluded that the trial court properly considered the tax and business consequences to the husband. The court noted that the wife had contributed to the parties' accumulation of property through her role as a tradition wife and that the wife's lack of business experience was not a valid reason for limiting her award. Because the trial court had no evidence on the amount of time expended by the wife's attorney, the court remanded for a reconsideration of the total amount of attorney fees and the portion that the husband should pay. Considering the complex plan devised by the trial court, the court determined that the fixing of the interest rate below the going rate was an integral part of the plan and as such was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General and the consumer brought an action against the corporation to recover allegedly usurious interest paid by the consumer under a revolving charge account agreement and to enjoin the violation of South Dakota's usury laws. The trial court granted summary judgment to the corporation on the ground that the substantive law of Illinois applied to the controversy and, therefore, the agreements involved were valid under Illinois law. The court observed that parties to a contract could effectively agree to be bound by the law of a particular state, but such governing law agreements were subject to limitations and invalidation by the overriding public policy of the forum state. The use of revolving charge account agreements which resulted in charges exceeding maximum legal interest in South Dakota were in violation of South Dakota usury statutes. The court held that the strong public policy regarding maximum interest rates allowable in revolving charge account agreements invalidated the governing law agreement of the parties and that the exaction of interest by the corporation of interest in excess of the rate prescribed in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 54-11-6 was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

After the petition was filed, the ordinance was amended and the classification of the property was amended from B-3 to a B-2 fringe district. The commission voted to approve the amended ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and advised that if he refused to take a chemical test his driver's license would be revoked for one year.

After arrival at the police station and being given the warning again, defendant was permitted to speak to his lawyer, but such attempts were futile. The officer then indicated that if he did not receive a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer to the question whether he would submit to the test, the lack of response would be considered a &quot;no.&quot; When the officer thereafter was writing a refusal, defendant indicated a willingness to take the test, but the officer did not permit him to do so. Defendant's driver's license was revoked, and the order appealed. The court affirmed, ruling that defendant's offer to take the test did not nullify his earlier refusals. The officer's permission for defendant to consult with his attorney was irrelevant, the court said, because he did not have a right to consult with counsel before deciding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both agents worked for the insurer and regularly received cash loans in the form of checks at regular intervals. The checks bore endorsement expressly stating that the amount of the check was a loan subject to repayment on demand. The amount of the loans was based on past production and future anticipated commissions with which the insurer credited their accounts as they were earned. The agency was reorganized to make the agent as principal. The agents assigned all past and future commissions to the corporation. They individually assumed personal liability for all the debts from the corporation. The jury returned a verdict against the agents individually and doing business as the corporation for about half of the amount the insurer sought. Upon review, the court found that there was no evidence that supported the agent's arguments the payments from the insurer were advances and not loans. He did not present any evidence that the insurer did not give him full credit for his commissions. He argued that the insurer's failure to produce computer printouts rendered its accounting suspect.

When they discussed whether the social worker should come over, the social worker replied that he would have to inform the police. Defendant said that he understood and gave the social worker his address. In affirming defendant's conviction the court held that this communication was not privileged under S.D. Codified Laws &sect;36-26-30. Section 36-26-30 did not make all communications with social workers privileged per se, only those which the facts and circumstances showed were disclosed to the social worker in his professional capacity and were necessary to enable him to render services in his professional capacity to the communicant. The admission of guilt did not satisfy this test. The trial court did not err by compelling the waiver of the asserted privilege by directing the social worker's preliminary hearing testimony to be read to the jury. The court also held that the warrantless search that followed upon the entry of the police to defendant's house was justified under the exigent circumstances and plain view doctrines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before their respective deaths, the deceased and his wife executed wills which left their respective estates to each other. The deceased died several days after his wife died. The co-administrators sought to distribute his estate pursuant to the provision of the Uniform Probate Code governing intestate succession. Objectors sought the application of &sect; 29-1-7 to the estate's distribution. The trial court found that the Code was in effect when the deceased died and controlled the intestate succession of his estate. On appeal, objectors argued that the Code was, on its face, incomplete and thus void. The court held that the Code was valid where omissions, inconsistencies, or uncertainness in a statute did not render the statute invalid unless the courts were unable to determine what the legislature intended or found that the statute could not be executed. The court also held that the Code's enactment, which post-dated the enactment of &sect; 29-1-7, repealed &sect; 29-1-7 where the Code was irreconcilably repugnant to &sect; 29-1-7 concerning intestate succession.</SPAN></P>

The court granted 90 days temporary custody. An adjudicatory hearing was held, and the court determined that the children were dependent and neglected.

On appeal, court rejected the parents' contention that &sect; 26-8-6 was unconstitutionally vague. Parents also claimed that they were denied their right to due process. The court agreed that the parents were not afforded proper notice, however, it found that the parents failed to show any prejudice. There was no prejudice as every finding was supported by competent evidence. The improperly admitted evidence was cumulative only, and where admissible evidence supported the findings, cumulative evidence, though inadmissible, was nonprejudicial. The lower court did not err in terminating the parents' parental rights. The parents had resisted attempts to provide assistance.

The independent school initiated the action to force the distribution of the balance in the intervenor's fund in accordance with S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 13-28-33.2. The trial court rendered judgment for the independent school district. The court affirmed, holding that the statutory method of distribution utilized was not unconstitutional. There was no requirements of uniformity or of equal protection of the law for the legislature to allocate and distribute public funds. The method of distribution did not violate S.D. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8, which provided that taxes could be applied only to the object for which they were levied.

On appeal, petitioner contended, inter alia, that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-16-5 destroyed the presumption of innocence by allowing the State to forego the burden of proof of whether a premeditated design existed by merely proving the independent elements that there was in fact a killing and that the killing was done by the accused as provided in S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-16-2. The court found, inter alia, that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-16-5 did not require petitioner to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not possess a premeditate design to effect the death of the person killed. Section 22-16-5 created an inference, which did not violate due process as long as the evidence necessary to raise the inference was sufficient for a rational juror to find the inferred fact beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the lesser-included offense of assault and battery. On appeal by defendant, the court affirmed. Although defendant, a man, had a jury composed of three men and nine women, the court held that defendant was not denied a fair cross-section under the Sixth Amendment and S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 16-13-10.1. Although the absolute percentage difference was more than 15 percent, the court refused to presume that there was not a fair cross-section of the community. After defendant made his objection to the jury panel composition, a second panel was called. In the absence of any evidence in the settled record to the contrary, the court presumed that the trial court acted correctly and that the second panel was called to correct the underrepresentation of males on the jury panel. Also, although the trial court sent messages to the jury to determine of it were close to a verdict, the communication was not improper because it did not contain any reference to a time and was not in any manner coercive.</SPAN></P>

The Personnel Policy Board found that the employee had been performing work for which he deserved to be reclassified and a higher salary. The DOT sought judicial review, but the circuit court affirmed. The DOT sought further review. In affirming, the court rejected the DOT's arguments that the Board exceeded its authority and that the Board had no authority to order an increase in the employee's pay from dedicated highway funds. While the Board was statutorily designated to serve as a &quot;grievance review board&quot; under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 3-6A-37, this was not the sole power or duty that the Board had. Further, compensation of employees was well within the constitutional limits of &quot;maintenance, construction, and supervision&quot; as contained in S.D. Codified Laws art. XI, &sect; 8. DOT employee salaries were paid out of the dedicated highway funds as authorized each year by the legislature, and the Board simply ordered the expenditure of funds for the compensation of an employee for work performed.</SPAN></P>

Codified Laws &sect; 39-17-129(4). The State sought the forfeiture of appellant's automobile, which purportedly contained a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that appellant's automobile was used to transport, possess, or conceal certain controlled drugs and substances in violation of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 39-17. The trial court granted the State's motion for default judgment and ordered that the automobile be condemned and forfeited to the State. Approximately one year after the trial court entered its default judgment, the court declared S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 39-17-129(4) unconstitutional because it did not provide for notice and hearing after seizure and prior to forfeiture. Appellant moved to set aside the judgment on the ground that the forfeiture statute was unconstitutional, which was denied. The court affirmed. The ruling that &sect; 39-17-129 was unconstitutional did not apply retroactively. Appellant received full procedural due process through proper notice and opportunity to be heard prior to actual forfeiture of his automobile. The trial court did not err in finding that the forfeiture could be pursued, even though appellant had neither been convicted of nor had pled to the underlying criminal charges. The validity of the forfeiture was not dependent upon the conviction of the registered owner of the automobile.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The isolated tract owners filed an application with the board, pursuant to S.D.

The servient parcel owner appealed. The trial court conducted a trial de novo and affirmed the board's resolution. On further appeal by the servient parcel owner, the court affirmed the part of the judgment granting the right-of-way. The court rejected the servient parcel owner's argument that &sect; 31-22 was unconstitutional because it condemned private property for private uses. The right-of-way created was a public right-of-way open to all the world. Section 31-22 did not unconstitutionally condemn private property without due process of law because the servient parcel owner was afforded a full hearing in a trial de novo before the trial court. The court reversed the judgment as to compensation because the appraisals at trial were based on the assumption that it was a private road and fencing would not be needed, and there would be no severance of the land by such fences. However, the court found fencing to be necessary.</SPAN></P>

The State initially entered into a plea bargain with defendant whereby the State agreed to drop most of the charges if defendant assisted them as an unpaid narcotics agent in securing eight arrests. The State later revoked the offer because defendant failed to carry out his end of the plea bargain. Defendant withdrew his plea and was tried and convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant failed to timely demand compliance with the plea bargain before he withdrew his guilty plea and proceeded to trial. Because the trial court was not given the opportunity to rule on the issue, it was waived. The trial court did not err by permitting the State to amend the information prior to the presentation of any evidence because defendant was not prejudiced by changing the illegal substance alleged from &quot;hashish&quot; to &quot;marijuana.&quot; S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23-39-1 did not bar the amendment because it did not apply to pre-trial amendments. The trial court did not err in admitting the codefendant's statements as declarations of a co-conspirator because they were sufficiently corroborated by undercover agents.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was not punished for an offense committed in another state, but was punished for bringing the stolen property into South Dakota. The court held that S.D. Codified Laws &sect;23-9-13 plainly indicated the legislative intent to denounce and punish the bringing into the state of personal property stolen in another state. It was not necessary to allege the original unlawful taking, for that would constitute the allegation of a wholly evidentiary matter.

The trial court affirmed the denial, holding that S. D. Codified Laws &sect; 35-2-6.1 prohibited any sale within 200 yards of any campus. On review, the applicant challenged the constitutionality of the statute under both the due process and equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. He contended that a recent ruling by the Board of Regents prohibiting personal consumption of 3.2 beer in dormitories abrogated any an all purposes of &sect; 35-2-6.1. Thus, there was no logical reason for the law. The court rejected the argument, holding that the intent of the Regent's ruling was not to provide opportunities for large gatherings involving the consumption of beer. The statute still had a legitimate purpose to prevent the atmosphere of beer joints on campus and was consistent with the Regent's ruling. The statute bore a reasonable relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose and did not deny the applicant his substantive due process rights or equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the trial of an Indian man, some of the Indian man's friends started a riot with police. A state's witness testified that the entire incident had been planned to disrupt the proceedings against the Indian man. The state used the statement against defendants, who allegedly participated in the conspiracy. The court rejected defendants' contention that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-10-4 was unconstitutional as an infringement on their First Amendment rights of free speech and association. The court further rejected defendant's contention that the statement was inadmissible because it was not made in furtherance of the conspiracy. Considering the expression &quot;in furtherance of the conspiracy&quot; to refer not to the admission as such but rather to the act concerning which the admission was made then, if that act was in furtherance of the conspiracy, the court could say that the admission was in furtherance of the conspiracy. In reviewing the evidence, there was ample evidence of the existence of the conspiracy to riot at the courthouse. The statements made were reliable because they were uttered by one of the leaders of the riot.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the State had relied upon defendant's guilty plea to the detriment of its case. Further, the court determined that it was in the trial court's discretion to find that defendant's request to withdraw his guilty plea was a frivolous request.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An information charged defendant with burglary in the third degree. It also alleged that defendant had five previous felony convictions and sought to have him punished as a habitual offender. The jury found defendant guilty of the burglary charge. After the verdict, the trial court sentenced him to prison for 16 years, which exceeded the maximum sentence allowed for defendant's offense. On appeal, the trial court's judgment convicting defendant and sentencing him to prison was affirmed. The court found that defendant's failure to object to the introduction of the statement he made in response to the arresting officer's question waived that issue on appeal. It also found that the record did not show reversible error with regard to his claim of overzealous prosecution. Defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the misdemeanor offense created by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-32-16. The court noted that it had previously sustained the constitutionality of the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-7-1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence. On review, the court affirmed. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in allowing the States to use his silence at the time of arrest for purposes of impeachment in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Where no objection was made to evidence, the trial court was not called upon to rule and an objection could not be raised the first time on appeal. Defendant made no objection, request for corrective action by the trial court or motion for new trial. Thus, the claimed error was not before the court for review. Similarly, with respect to defendant's further contention that a fair trial was denied for overzealous prosecution, the record did not show reversible error. The court also noted that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-7-1, the habitual criminal statute, did not create a new or independent crime, but declared being a habitual criminal was a status, and thus to be charged with being a habitual criminal was not to be charged with a crime.</SPAN></P>

Defendant proceeded to a second room where he removed his pants and awakened a young woman. Defendant subjected the woman to three acts. Each of the acts constituted rape as defined by statute. When the victim began crying rather loudly, defendant warned her to be quiet and that she wouldn't get hurt. Defendant argued that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-22-1 (1975) was unconstitutional for vagueness because the statutory definition of rape did not include the element of lack of consent. The court found that the statute was not vague, and that it was sufficient to put citizens on notice of the definition of rape, which included the element of compulsion. The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to give a jury instruction on consent because there was no evidence to support a consent instruction. The court found that the prosecutor's comments in his opening statement constituted error, but in light of the evidence against defendant, it held that the comments were not prejudicial. Therefore, it affirmed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an organized county and its commissioners, challenged a decision from a circuit court (South Dakota), which declared the attachment of an unorganized county to the organized county for administration of governmental and fiscal affairs pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 7-17-1 to be constitutional. Respondents were elected state officials. Intervenors were competing candidates for the position of county commissioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The South Dakota Legislature attached the unorganized county to the organized county for administrative purposes. Although the county officers of the organized county had all of the powers and liabilities for the administration of the affairs of the unorganized county, the residents of the organized county were not allowed to vote for the unorganized county's officers. Appellants contended that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 7-17-1 denied them due process, equal protection, and their right to a free and equal election, as guaranteed by the South Dakota Constitution. They argued that the counties had been consolidated without the consent of their residents in contravention of S.D. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1. On review, the court held that the legislature had plenary power over counties and the attachment was a valid exercise of its authority. Appellants were not denied equal protection because the attachment was reasonably related to the problem of the administration of the unorganized county. However, the court found that the election process did not pass the equal protection test, and redistricting was required. This also required that neither candidate be certified to hold office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found the attachment statute to be constitutional. It held that the election process was invalid and that the new reapportionment should be completed. It further held that neither candidate could be certified to hold that office. The court remanded the matter to enter such necessary orders to carry out the mandate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that it was error for the trial court to deny his motion to suppress evidence obtained in a warrantless search of his apartment conducted immediately after police officers forcefully entered his apartment. On appeal, the court concluded that defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated and that it was proper to admit the evidence seized. There were exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless intrusion. Random shots had emanated from the area of the window of defendant's apartment. The time of entry was late at night. Although the late entry possibly required a stricter test of reasonableness, it was more difficult to secure a warrant at night than it would be in the daytime. Indeed one of the officers attempted to get a warrant, but could not contact the magistrate. Under the circumstances the warrantless entry was reasonable and was the only rational thing to do to protect the officers and the community from the potential danger that had been evidenced by the prior shooting. Moreover, the officers had reasonable grounds to believe that announcing their intention would increase their peril. Finally, defendant's warrantless arrest was also valid.</SPAN></P>

Random shots had emanated from the area of defendant's apartment, the offense was a crime of violence, and the officers reasonably believed the suspects to be armed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The optometrist had been licensed by the State prior to living and practicing in Canada. The board determined to revoke the optometrist's license for failing to comply with continuing education requirements. The optometrist claimed that education courses he received while in Canada constituted substantial compliance and that the revocation was improper. The court held that the fact that one of the board's members practiced optometry in the same city as the optometrist did not render the board unconstitutional because the board was not aware the optometrist had moved to the city until the order of revocation was agreed upon. The particular optometric association in which the optometrist received education was not an approved association for such courses. Further, the optometrist did not provide certification for such course as required by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 36-7-20.2. Nor did the optometrist made no request for approval of the courses he took.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction on the grounds that the pre-arrest delay deprived him of his constitutional right to a speedy trial, that he was given an insufficient time to prepare for trial, that the trial judge improperly refused to recuse himself, that the trial court should have determined that the riot baton was not a dangerous weapon and accordingly should have granted his motion to dismiss, and that the riot statutes were unconstitutional. In affirming, the court held that the law enforcement authorities exercised due diligence in attempting to take defendant into custody. Any pre-arrest delay was caused, at least in part, by the conduct of defendant, and he was not prejudiced by any conduct on the part of the State in that regard. Further, no prejudice resulted to defendant in the delay from arrest to trial. Further, the judge's wife and the prosecutor having a family relationship in the fourth degree, and the evidence being clear that there were no significant social relations between them, the trial judge properly refused to recuse himself. Finally, it was for the trial court to determine whether the instrument carried was a deadly or dangerous weapon.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the mere possession of the slot machines was a violation of the statute and it was not required that the slot machines be operated or played. The court also ruled that the evidence did not support the giving of the good faith defense instruction because there was no evidence to support such an instruction. The court also ruled that trial court acted reasonably in imposing as a condition of suspending execution of the jail sentence imposed upon defendant that he waive his right to be free from search and seizure for a period of one year during which time any police officer or other law enforcement officer was permitted to search defendant and his premises anytime of the day or night for gambling machines due to defendant's occupation.</SPAN></P>

In reversing the order the court held that the general rule embodied in S.D.

The court noted that while the residents were displeased with the progress of an irrigation project, this was not sufficient cause to justify relief by the extraordinary remedy of reapportionment by injunction. Indeed reapportionment was primarily the duty and responsibility of the state through its legislature or other body, rather than of a court. No court-ordered plan of reapportionment should issue until it had been determined that a plan of reapportionment cannot or will not be enacted by the appropriate non-judicial body.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being arrested for driving while intoxicated, the driver refused to take a chemical test. Subsequently, after holding a hearing on the matter, the Department of Public Safety revoked the driver's license for a period of one year. On appeal, the circuit court affirmed the decision of the hearing officer. On further appeal, the court also affirmed. The court found that the fact that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-11 was amended in 1976 to allow the Department discretion to impose restrictions upon a motorist's right to drive in lieu of revoking his license did not mean that the statute prior to amendment was in any way unconstitutional. It did not change the essential nature of the pre-revocation hearing, added to &sect; 32-23-11 in 1973, which was to determine whether there was compliance with the implied consent statute. The court rejected the driver's contention that the one-year revocation was too severe, holding that it was for the legislature to determine the appropriate penalty for a driver who refused to consent to a chemical test.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended on appeal that &sect; 23-7-3 was unconstitutional in that it punished a person because of a prior condition or status and placed him twice in jeopardy. The court found that defendant's attack upon the constitutionality of the statute was without merit. Defendant next contended that third degree burglary was not necessarily a crime of violence within the meaning of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23-7-1. The court found that the legislature did not intend that the State be required to prove as an element of the offense defined by S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23-7-3 the fact that the underlying offense of burglary was committed in a violent manner. Finally, the trial court did not err in refusing to give what in effect would have been a jury nullification error.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-10-3 did not deny defendants due process of law by allowing a conviction of a major crime without a showing of criminal or culpable intent to commit the felony charged. The court noted that the crime of riot was a group crime requiring proof of a common or mutual criminal intent. The court found that when the crime was committed, all participants were guilty of riot as principals, and that the State was only obligated to prove the common or mutual intent of the group to commit an unlawful act by force or violence or the threat thereof. The State was not required to show that every rioter committed, or intended to commit, arson, but only that one or more of the rioters, in the course of the riot, intended to, and did, set unlawful fires. The court concluded that the riot statutes contained words of common usage and understanding, that they clearly gave fair notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that certain specific conduct was prohibited, and that they were not overly vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case came before the court on the State's motion to revoke defendant's bail. Defendant, a Native American activist, had been convicted of rioting to obstruct, S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-10-4, and was released on bail pending appeal, with certain conditions. The court referred the matter to the trial court, which reported defendant had violated the conditions of his bail. Defendant asked that the bail conditions be amended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bail conditions in question were to refrain from participating in American Indian Movement (AIM) activities, with certain exceptions, and that bail would be revoked on any subsequent criminal conviction. Defendant then pled guilty to misdemeanor assault and participated in an AIM demonstration and a meeting with law enforcement authorities. In view of the plea-bargaining involved and the lenient sentence, the court was loath to revoke bail on the assault alone. The court held that the trial court had a rational basis to impose as a condition of bond a prohibition against defendant's participation in any AIM activities except fund raising and activities within the courts. Thus the court found no infringement of defendant's First Amendment rights to freedom of association, speech, and travel. S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23-51-14 empowered the court to remand defendant to custody pending determination of his appeal, which the court ordered because defendant violated a restriction of his release on bail, the violation was not through inadvertence or mistake, and the prohibited activity on several former occasions led to violent confrontations between AIM members and law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's application for an amendment of the order admitting him to bail was denied, and the State's motion for revocation of bail was granted and an order was entered that revoked defendant's bail and remanded him to custody.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that evidence of his breath and blood tests were inadmissible. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court explained that the state's complied consent laws, S.D.

Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-7. The court explained that while defendant was free to revoke the implied consent, the implied consent laws imposed consequences including the revocation of his driver's license. The court opined that the State's failure to comply with the implied consent laws did not render defendant's breath and blood test inadmissible. Instead, as a consequence of its failure to comply, the State was unable to rely upon the statutory presumptions regarding the blood level necessary to presume intoxication. The court found that the State proved that defendant was intoxicated with evidence regarding the manner in which the accident occurred, the observation of defendant by the arresting officers, and the testimony of alcohol consumption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor shot a hotel night clerk and then attempted to rape her.

The minor's claim that S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 26-8-22.7 and 26-11-4 were unconstitutionally vague failed because the South Dakota statutes on juvenile transfer hearings met all appropriate constitutional requirements. In addition, the juvenile court's &quot;Decision and Order&quot; stating that the minor's conduct appeared to be a random act of violence done in a manner calculated to grievously injure or possibly kill another human being without any cause or provocation, that he should be kept confined in a secure environment to protect society against the possibility of similar acts in the future, that juvenile facilities were not sufficiently secure to protect society from the minor, and that satisfactory treatment and rehabilitative agencies would be available to the minor in the adult system provided an adequate basis for review by the court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs purchased cattle vaccines manufactured by defendants, and instituted suit following post-vaccinal illnesses in their herds, alleging breach of implied warranty of fitness.

In rejecting defendants' disclaimer argument, the court concluded that defendants' disclaimer failed to comply with S.D.

Defendants' attempt to disclaim its implied warranty failed both tests.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendants urged that the statutory presumption was a rebuttable one, while the State maintained that the presumption was conclusive. Defendants also argued that the presumption was violative of due process requirements and that their preliminary hearing was invalid because they were prohibited from questioning the victim about her past sexual conduct and her mental capacity to consent to sexual intercourse. Finally, defendants argued that the information was unconstitutionally vague and failed to state a public offense. The appellate court concluded that the statutory presumption had to be construed as rebuttable in order to give full force and effect to all of the provisions of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-22-1, consistent with the state and federal constitutions. The appellate court rejected defendants' remaining contentions, holding (1) that it was unable on the basis of the record to declare the presumption unconstitutional, (2) that the prohibition at defendants' preliminary hearing of questions regarding the victim's past sexual conduct and mental capacity to consent was not error, and (3) that the trial court properly refused to set aside the information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorists' notices of appeal in the circuit court specified that the appeals were made under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 21-33-1 (1967), and they were not an appeal from a trial de novo under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-12. The circuit court apparently felt that there was no choice but to dismiss the purported appeals because the motorists had rejected the &sect; 32-23-12 trial de novo appeal. Under the state of the law as it was prior to the 1975 amendment, the circuit judge's decision would have been correct. However, the enactment of 1975 S.D. Laws 17 completely and effectively repealed by implication the special provisions of &sect; 32-23-12 with respect to the mode and method of the appeal. At the time the attorney general's motion for dismissal was before the circuit court the references in the notice of Appeal to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 21-33-1 were also superseded as a matter of law by the provisions of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; ch. 1-26; the trial court was bound to make its determination based on the provisions of Chapter 1-26, as amended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit courts orders of dismissal were reversed. The cases were remanded to the circuit court with directions to entertain the appeals under the amended provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of a decision by the trial court (South Dakota), which denied their motion to suppress evidence found in their car at an Alcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP) roadblock. Defendants were charged with unlawful possession of an open container of alcoholic beverage and unlawful possession of marijuana in a quantity in excess of one ounce. Defendants obtained an intermediate appeal under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23-51-5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Patrolmen at the roadblock were parked on a highway near a large stop sign with their red lights on, and they stopped all vehicles passing in both directions. The officer that stopped defendants testified that under the ASAP program, one roadblock per week was set up in alternating areas, primarily for alcohol related offenses. He said that defendants showed him an open container when he asked them about a beer smell in the car, and that a further investigation revealed marijuana in the car. The record did not reveal by whom the decision to set up the roadblock was made. On review, the court found that the roadblock stop was an unconstitutional infringement of defendants' state and federal rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. It held that unless authorized by prior judicial warrant, a roadblock established to investigate all motorists for possible liquor law violations constituted an unconstitutional seizure, but it noted nothing in its opinion should be construed to limit police authority to apprehend on motorists guilty of driving under the influence or open container offenses based on the usual standards of probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State appealed from judgments of the circuit court (South Dakota), which ordered the State to return motor vehicles seized under forfeiture statutes, S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 39-17-129 to 39-17-137, to defendant owners. The State argued that the statutes did not unconstitutionally deprive the owners of property without due process because they failed to provide for notice and hearing after seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State seized three vehicles and began forfeiture proceedings against them under the State Drugs and Substances Control Act, S.D. Codified Laws &sect;&sect; 39-17-129 to 39-17-137. The trial court found for the owners, holding that the forfeiture statutes were unconstitutional in that they contained no provisions for the notice and hearing after seizure and, therefore, unconstitutionally deprived the owners of their property without due process of law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2. The court affirmed. The court rejected the State's contention that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 39-17-137 required prompt legal proceedings to be instituted after seizure. That section merely provided for the disposition of the seized property after the property had been forfeited through court proceedings. The fact that notice and hearing could be obtained in the forfeiture action that followed seizure was inadequate. The notice and hearing provisions had to be contained within the forfeiture statute itself to satisfy constitutional principles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants set up a drug dealing business in a motel room. The manager was suspicious and eavesdropped on one of the defendants' phone conversations. He heard defendant ask for scales and mention that something was a dime less. He noticed a lot of activity in and out of defendants' motel room and called the police. A captain came and noticed people he knew as being involved in the local drug scene coming out of defendants' room. He told the manager that they did not have enough evidence for a warrant. Two days later the maid found marijuana in defendants' room while cleaning. The police then obtained a search warrant and arrested defendants when they found marijuana in their room. The trial court held that all subsequent evidence was fruit of the poisonous tree resulting from the illegal eavesdropping. The court held that the attenuation rule applied. The primary taint of the illegal eavesdropping was purged. The warrant was issued only after the maid found marijuana in defendants' room.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile appealed from a transfer certificate of the Circuit Court of the Eighth Judicial Circuit for Butte County (South Dakota), which transferred the juvenile's case to adult court for criminal proceedings. The juvenile was charged with two counts of attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The transfer was effectuated under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 26-11-4, and an issue on appeal was the constitutionality of that statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A transfer certificate was issued to move the juvenile's case to adult court for criminal proceedings. The juvenile appealed, arguing that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 26-11-4 was unconstitutionally vague and violated the due process required by the Fourteenth Amendment and the S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2. The juvenile claimed that &sect; 26-11-4 did not provide adequate criteria to guide the juvenile court in deciding when to transfer juveniles to adult court. The court held that when considered with the intent of S.D. Codified Laws chs. 26-7, 26-8, 26-11, which protected juveniles from the punitive part of criminal law and provided for rehabilitation, the standard was sufficient to prevent the juvenile court's discretion in arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory ways. Where there was substantial evidence to support the juvenile court's finding it was in the best interest of the juvenile that the juvenile court retained jurisdiction over him. The court ruled the decision to transfer was not based on substantial evidence. The evidence presented at the transfer hearing did not show any evidence of a premeditated design to affect the death of a human necessary for the alleged attempted murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student desired to participate in cross country for his high school, but refused to submit to an examination by a medical doctor to certify his health. His requests for a licensed chiropractor to administer the examination were denied. The student's father brought an action and was granted an alternative writ of prohibition enjoining the association from taking any further actions concerning the student's eligibility until a final determination of the issues was made. The association was ordered to show cause why the writ should not be made permanent, and the association was enjoined from enforcing its rules and regulations. Following a hearing, the trial court vacated the alternative writ and denied the petition for a permanent writ. The court affirmed, holding that S.D. Codified Laws &sect;13-36-4 was simply a delegation of discretionary power to the school board. The control over interscholastic activities lay within the discretionary power of a school board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's failure to dismiss the case on the ground that it was not brought on for trial within two terms of court as required by S.D. Codified Laws &sect;23-34-2 was not error because the postponement was on defendant's request. In addition, the language of the ordinance set forth a constitutionally permissible definition of obscenity, and the affidavit prepared by a detective who viewed the movie set forth sufficient facts in sufficient detail to enable a magistrate to make a determination of probable obscenity under the ordinance to justify his issuance of a warrant for the seizure of the film. The trial court properly refused to permit two witnesses to give an opinion as to whether the movie exceeded the bounds of contemporary community standards in its appeal to prurient interest because there was no showing made that they had any expertise whatever on this issue, and it did not err in refusing to receive into evidence other allegedly comparable sexually oriented materials offered by defendant.

Neither the director nor the sheriff had a search warrant. On appeal, the court determined that the claim that a search warrant was necessary had merit. There was admittedly no emergency present. The primary objective of the inspection was not the welfare of the inhabitants of the farm. The director's objective was to discover any property not listed on defendant's tax assessment statement.

The court held that evidence of events prior to an order of the trial court that it was without jurisdiction to deprive the mother of custody was admissible. The court further held that when a parent's conduct was in issue, it was contrary to the interest of the child and the state to allow the parent to assert the physician-patient privilege on the child's behalf, and that it was within the trial court's power to waive the privilege on behalf of an infant when it was not to the prejudice of the infant to do so.

The Act also empowered the board to negotiate agreements for outdoor advertising as deemed appropriate. The Act further empowered the board to establish unzoned commercial and industrial areas as large as permissible. Plaintiffs contended that the Act was an unconstitutional delegation of power. The court agreed, holding that the Act lacked an adequate standard to support a lawful delegation of authority. The court held that: (1) the legislature might delegate power subject to the requirement that adequate standards be adopted to guide the body to whom the power was delegated; (2) statutes attempting to adopt future laws were unconstitutional; (3) a statute which in effect reposed an absolute and undefined discretion in an administrative agency bestowed arbitrary powers and was an unlawful delegation of legislative powers; and (4) the board's authority to consider such things as &quot;it shall deem appropriate&quot; and to establish unzoned areas &quot;as large as permissible,&quot; constituted unregulated discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with having sold five pounds of marijuana to an undercover agent. The court held that the Drug and Substances Control Act, S.D.

Codified Laws &sect; 39-17-57(7). The classification of marijuana with harder drugs was not unreasonable or arbitrary, even if it could have been done differently. Neither was the Act the unlawful delegation of legislative authority to the office of commissioner of drug and substances control. The trial court did not err in allowing the undercover agent to testify. Defendant was not in custody as they did the drug deal and she was not required to read him Miranda rights. The drug delivery was not a search. There was no reason to allow cross-examination of the agent on whether her breasts were tattooed. The jury was properly instructed on the issue of entrapment and in response to a question from the jury after it had retired for deliberation.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the there was a presumption of validity of the statutes, and that no statute should be held unconstitutional unless its infringement of constitutional restrictions was so plain and palpable to admit no reasonable doubt.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction, noting that the sexual activity involving the victim was relevant to the conduct that was charged, thus evidence of defendant's involvement under these circumstances was properly admitted. Also, the flight by defendant and companions in their car, the attempted robbery immediately after that were found to be part of the res gestae that tended to prove defendant was guilty of another crime. Defendant had held something like a knife to the victim's neck and threatened to kill and/or cut her in taking her purse.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of driving while intoxicated. On appeal, he contended that the trial court should not have admitted the results of a breathalyzer test because the investigating officer had failed to place him under formal arrest, had failed to request that he submit to such a test, and had failed to advise him of his right to refuse to submit to such test and of the consequences of such refusal. The court reversed the conviction. The court held that the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant and had, in fact, taken him into custody, which was a de facto arrest. However, the court concluded that the failure of the officer to advise defendant of his right to refuse the test in compliance with the implied consent statute,&nbsp;S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-10, absent any factors that made compliance impossible or unnecessary, rendered the test results inadmissible at trial.

The court found that the evidence, including defendant's own testimony, pointed overwhelmingly to the fact that he had knowledge that the pills that he sold contained a drug. The court stated that it was not possible to consider that a responsible, unbiased jury could have come to any other conclusion but that defendant knew of this fact.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers included five construction firms that successfully bid on city contracts for the installation of reinforced concrete pipe and appurtenances for an addition to a city sewer. The city purchased the pipe and had it delivered to the installation site. The taxpayers provided the proper foundation for the pipe and restored the surface. The pipe became an integral part of the municipally operated sewer system. Each taxpayer was assessed a use tax on the pipe that it installed. The taxpayers filed a subsequent action against appellants for a refund of taxes that they paid under protest. The trial court issued a subsequent judgment in the taxpayers' favor. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 10-46-5 imposed a use tax on the taxpayers for pipe that the taxpayers installed in furtherance of its contract with the city. The court recognized that the pipe was owed by the city. The court further held that &sect; 10-46-5 was constitutional. The court noted that the use tax did not fall under the proscription of S.D. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5 because the use tax was not a tax on property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that the child was dependent and neglected. After trial, the district county court entered a decree terminating the parental rights of the mother and the father.

The mother argued that the phrase &quot;neglected or dependent child&quot; as defined in S.D.

Codified Laws &sect; 15-6-26(d). The court concluded that (1) the language of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 26-8-6 did convey sufficiently definite warning as to proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice; (2) a sufficient foundation was not laid to prove the unavailability of the witnesses and the circuit court erred in admitting their previous testimony into evidence; and (3) the error was not prejudicial to the mother because the witnesses' testimony was only cumulative of evidence adduced from the other witnesses who were present and testified at the trial de novo.</SPAN></P>

U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court reasoned that the Amendment did not afford protection to a wrongdoer's misplaced belief that a person to whom she voluntarily confided her wrongdoing would not reveal it. The court held that defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was not violated when her friend quizzed her in her home about the murder where there was no compulsion or force applied to defendant or to a co-conspirator to force them to divulge the information they so freely gave forth. U.S. Const. amend. V. The court determined that defendant's Sixth Amendment rights to counsel were not violated by the police investigation that was conducted by defendant's friend where her right to counsel only attached at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings had been initiated against her.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a wage dispute, the firefighters filed a petition pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 9-14A-2. The city refused to appoint an arbitrator, as required under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 9-14A-3. Instead, the city claimed that the act was unconstitutional and commenced an action for a determination of its constitutionality. The trial court concluded that S.D. Codified Laws. &sect; 9-14A-18 was unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of legislative power and was contrary to the provisions of S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 26. On appeal, the court agreed that, under the language of S.D. Const. art. III, &sect; 26, S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 9-14A-18 was clearly unconstitutional. The court also found, however, that the provisions of S.D. Codified Laws ch. 3-18, which governed grievance procedures of public employees, would have been made confusing by retention of the remaining sections of S.D. Codified Laws ch. 9-14A. Clearly, the legislature would not have adopted the provision in direct conflict with other law had they known that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 9-14A-18 would be declared void. Thus, the court found the remainder of S.D. Codified Laws ch. 9-14A to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that there was no unreasonable delay before defendant's trial and there was no prejudice to defendant resulting from the delay. Moreover, some delay was justifiable where defendant waited until less than two weeks before trial to request a change of venue. Where a case had been set for trial and where a change of venue granted less than two weeks before the trial date required rescheduling of the case to another county, there resulted a postponement of the trial, and the two-term time requirement of &sect; 23-34-2 did not apply after such a postponement.

The claimant sought further compensation for the 1972 injury and hospitalization because it bore a causal relationship to the 1969 injury. The commissioner denied the claim. The court held that in the claimant's successive injury case, the full liability was placed upon the insurance carrier covering the risk of the 1969 injury. Under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 62-7-5, the release could be set aside because the consequences of the 1969 injury were not discoverable until the later injuries.

He argued that the Act remained unconstitutional, despite its subsequent codification, because under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 2-16-15, the legislature was required to reenact a statute whenever a challenge was begun before the effective date of the statute's codification. The court rejected defendant's argument and held: (1) although codification did not validate defects in the original passage of a law with regard to criminal offenses or proceedings committed or commenced prior to codification, under &sect; 2-16-15 codification operated to validate such defects with regard to offenses and proceedings subsequent to the date of codification; and (2) the court could not review defendant's claim that the trial court gave an improper reasonable doubt instruction because he did not object to the instruction when it was given as required by S.D.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District County Court of Davison County (South Dakota), which convicted him of wilfully and wrongfully committing the act of window peeping which greatly outrages public decency and is injurious to the public morals in violation of S.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-24-6, under which he was convicted for of wilfully and wrongfully committing the act of window peeping, was void for vagueness under S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 2 and 7, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. He also claimed that the information against him was insufficient because it did not set out the name of the person against whom the offense was committed. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because a person of ordinary intelligence would know that going onto another person's property and peeking in at a 16--year-old girl as she was disrobing and taking a bath would outrage public decency and be injurious to public morals. The information contained the name of the defendant, the date and place of the offense, recited that defendant willfully and wrongfully committed the act of window peeping, and apprised defendant with reasonable certainty of the nature of the accusation against him so that he could prepare his defense. Accordingly, it was sufficient under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23-32-5. Because the offense was against the public rather than a particular victim it was not necessary to include the victim's name.</SPAN></P>

Finding the front door nailed shut, he went to the back door, and as he passed a window he looked in and saw defendants sitting in the room with what he recognized to be a hashish pipe used for smoking marijuana. He then entered the back door, identified himself, and, upon smelling marijuana, entered the living room where he arrested the persons present and confiscated the materials. Defendants claimed that the sheriff had conducted an illegal search. After finding that the sheriff had a right and duty to be on the property and walk past the window, the court held that entry into the house and seizure of the marijuana and paraphernalia were lawful under the &quot;plain view&quot; doctrine. Thus, prosecution of defendant who had been in the kitchen when the sheriff entered was proper because his presence in the house was sufficient to circumstantially prove that he intentionally occupied the room where the marijuana was found.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying dispute stemmed from the attempts of two separate groups of Regents' employees to organize and gain recognition as bargaining units in their relations with the Regents. The Regents argued that the Commissioner was without jurisdiction to review their decision to recognize one group of employees and decline to recognize the other group of employees. The Attorney General argued that the Regents lacked the authority to hire the services of an independent counsel to bring the instant action. The court affirmed the judgment in part, reversed it in part, and remanded the cause with instructions, holding that the Regents had the authority to employ counsel outside the Attorney General's office in bringing the instant action. The court also held that S.D. Codified Laws ch. 3-18, the State's public employee labor relations statute, was constitutional as it applied to the Regents. The court reasoned that S.D. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 3 allowed the legislature to make rules governing the form of the Regents' control, and that S.D. Codified Laws ch. 3-18 constituted such rules.</SPAN></P>

It had to be assumed, however, that the passengers were correct in maintaining they did not feel any pull on the car from the brakes and that they did not see the driver apply the brakes. The driver gave uncontroverted testimony that he swerved to avoid hitting the snowplow. The car was traveling 60 to 65 miles per hour and the snowplow at about 5 to 10 miles per hour. The road was clear and the visibility good. Without passing on the driver's conduct after the snowplow was identified, the record concerning his acts before this did not eliminate all issues of material fact. Approaching a moving cloud of snow at 60 to 65 miles per hour was not so unambiguous as to leave no genuine issue as to any material fact of willful and wanton misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for disorderly conduct after he took a swing at his girlfriend during an argument. The complaint under which defendant was convicted alleged that &sect; 8-1-107 was violated in that defendant wilfully and unlawfully created a public disturbance by engaging in threatening and tumultuous behavior, namely trying to strike another person. Although defendant did not contend that &sect; 8-1-107 was unconstitutional as it was applied to him, he argued that it contravened the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it was vague and overbroad on its face. However, there was nothing vague or overbroad about the charge in this case or about sections A and B of the ordinance, which were the basis for the charge. In addition, although some of the sections of the ordinance standing alone might have been considered overbroad and vague, when read with the preamble, the forbidden activities were narrowed so that they made sense and were readily understandable to a person of reasonable intelligence and experience. Thus, there was no reason to strike down the entire ordinance on its face without the benefit of a set of facts before the court as to how it was to be applied.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the passenger's argument that Fourteenth Amendment was violated because the guest statute operated against all individuals and treated them uniformly.  Section 32-34-1 had not violated the due process guarantee of S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2 because all persons were entitled to a hearing on whether the guest statute applied to them. Under S.D.

The court held that the rationale of the prevention of collusion between negligent drivers and guests did not support the guest statute. The hospitality rationale of the guest statute was constitutional. The guest statute was not reasonable but the court was not entitled to substitute its judgment for that of the legislature.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Board of Examiners in Optometry received written complaints alleging that certain optometrists were guilty of unprofessional conduct in aiding and abetting an optical company in the unlawful practice of optometry. Formal hearings were scheduled, but the date past without the hearings being held or rescheduled. Respondent, an employee of the optical company, filed suit against the Board of Examiners to enjoin further proceedings. The circuit court granted the requested relief, and the Board of Examiners appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that the employee had standing to institute suit. Under S.D.

Further, the circuit court had jurisdiction over the matter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his manslaughter conviction by the Circuit Court of Minnehaha County (South Dakota). He asserted that the court erred when it received hearsay statements at trial that were not properly admissible as dying declarations under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23-44-4. Defendant also asserted that the court erred when it admitted into evidence witness testimony taken from a preliminary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of manslaughter by the trial court, a decision the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion when it admitted a decedent's dying declarations into evidence under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23-44-4. Those declarations were clearly made and concerned matters that constituted the res gestate of the crime. Also, the decedent was sane when he made those statements and believed that his death was near. As defendant had knowingly aided and abetted the commission of the crime, he was properly punished as an accomplice under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 23-10-3. Defendant's presence at the scene of the crime did not ensure that he was a participant thereto, but it was a circumstance which tended to support his conviction. Finally, witness testimony from a preliminary hearing was properly admitted into trial because it was shown that an examination had transpired in a judicial tribunal, that the witness was sworn and testified, that the accused had an opportunity for cross-examination, that the parties and issues were substantially the same in both proceedings, and that the witness was unavailable.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, noting that the attorney and his counsel had been complete access to the file of the investigation against the attorney. The court also found, in response to the attorney's assertion, that the disciplinary procedure in South Dakota did not violate the right of due process that was guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment. The attorney also claimed that the court unconstitutionally participated in the investigatory stage of the proceedings by examining the investigator's report that was filed with the grievance committee. The court emphasized that its decision was based solely on the record before the referee and that it had a unique responsibility to maintain the high ethical standards of the profession.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in favor of the board and the union sought review, arguing that those listed issues related to &quot;other conditions of employment&quot; under S. D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant brought the action alleging that the title company charged him excessive fees for abstracting services performed. The trial court rendered summary judgment for the title company. The court reversed and remanded, holding that appellant and other members of the class involuntarily made payments to the title company for abstracting fees, and, therefore, had a right to recover any charges in excess of those prescribed in &sect; 36-13-25. The court allowed reasonable compensation to the title company for those services performed at the request of the abstractor's client, which were not enumerated in the above statute. The court found that abstracting fees charged in excess of those prescribed by statute were analogous to usurious interest payments due to the monopolistic aspects of the abstracting business. The title company's contention that &sect; 36-13-25 was unconstitutional was untenable. Because the abstractors' product was an indispensable part of real property transfers, the legislature properly exercised its police power by the enactment of S.D. Codified Laws ch. 36-13.</SPAN></P>

At the police station, the arresting officer gave defendant a &quot;pat&quot; search for a possible weapon. The officer felt a lump in defendant's jacket pocket, reached into the pocket, and pulled out a plastic bag in which there were seeds and what appeared to be stems. Defendant was tried and convicted of possession of a controlled substance. Defendant contended that the search and seizure which resulted in the discovery of marijuana following his arrest was in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV and S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 11. The court found that in the case of a lawful custodial arrest, a full search of the person of a suspect was not only an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment but was also a &quot;reasonable&quot; search under the Fourth Amendment. Defendant's arrest for reckless driving was based on probable cause inasmuch as the arresting officer observed defendant's driving, and there was no doubt that the arresting officer took defendant into lawful custody. It was sufficient that the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant and that he lawfully effectuated the arrest and placed defendant in custody.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was in a one-vehicle accident, and a neighbor took defendant home where defendant drank a couple of ounces of 190 proof Everclear alcohol for a suspected heart condition. Shortly thereafter, defendant lapsed into an unconscious state on the floor, his wife called an ambulance, and he was transferred to a hospital. At the hospital, the sheriff read defendant a Miranda warning and the implied consent law. After being given a choice under the implied consent law to either consent to the test or have his driver's license taken away for one year, defendant consented to a blood test, which tested .25 of alcoholic content in the blood. The court reversed. Defendant was not under arrest because the alleged misdemeanor was not committed in the sheriff's presence. Lacking a legal arrest, and with considerable doubt as to whether there was ever any arrest valid or invalid, or any charge, formal or informal, prior to defendant making the choice of taking a blood test, the court had no hesitancy in ruling that the evidence of the blood test should have been suppressed, and the jury should not have been allowed to consider the statutory presumption.</SPAN></P>

Two of the three people in the other vehicle died in the collision. Defendant was taken to the hospital. Two police officers visited defendant in the hospital and placed him under arrest for driving while intoxicated after one of the officers detected alcohol on his breath. A sample of defendant's blood was then taken. The sample contained a blood alcohol reading that was more than sufficient to raise the statutory presumption that he had been driving while under the influence of alcohol. A jury found defendant fund guilty of second degree manslaughter. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the results of the blood alcohol test were properly admitted into evidence because the failure of the police officer to inform defendant that a person died as a result of the accident did not invalidate defendant's consent to submit to the blood test. The court ruled that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-10 did not require the police to notify the subject being tested of any more than information than that he had the right to refuse and that his license would have been suspended if failed to consent to the test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After viewing certain films in a theater, officers arrested defendant for obscenity and seized the films. On appeal, the court held that the films shown were hard-core pornography, were obscene pursuant to S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 22-24-11(1) and (2), and were not constitutionally protected. The court rejected defendant's contention that the films were illegally seized. The court found that the arresting officers had an arrest warrant which had been issued upon their complaint, based upon their having previously viewed the films in their entirety, and their determination that they were obscene. They determined that a misdemeanor was being committed in their presence and when they returned to serve the arrest warrant, it was still being committed and in their presence. They were therefore entitled and within their right to make a search incidental to the arrest. The court rejected defendant's contention that the South Dakota status relating to obscenity were unconstitutional and at variance with the standard set down by the United States Supreme Court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board passed two similar resolutions declaring a surplus to exist in the district's general fund. Each resolution authorized the transfer of $ 100,000 from the general fund to the capital outlay fund. The taxpayers claimed that such transfers violated S.D. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8, insofar as they would result in the application of taxes to objects that were not stated to be objects of the taxes in the law under which those taxes were levied. Noting that it appeared from the record that approximately $ 221,000 in the general fund had been received from sources other than local property tax levies, and that art. XI, &sect; 8 therefore had no application to that amount of funds in the general fund, the court found that the transfers made by the school board were less than the amount derived from nontax sources. Since nowhere in the record did it appear that the proceeds transferred by the district were proceeds which were raised by taxes from local tax levies, as distinguished from proceeds which came from &quot;other sources&quot; as defined in S.D.

The board's resolution stated that the bond did not create an indebtedness of the State of South Dakota (State), and was payable only from the net revenues derived from the operation of the housing facilities, and was not payable out of or enforceable against the State, or any fund created or maintained directly or indirectly from taxation. The court held that the board could legally consolidate and refund the existing revenue bonds. The refunding of the existing revenue bonds did not create a &quot;debt&quot; in violation of the Constitution, as the obligation of the State was not changed by the refunding and consolidation in any manner.

It was from this list that jurors were drawn and summoned to appear in a number designated by judges of courts involved. This group was referred to as the regular panel. Section 16-13-43 had its origin in a former statute, which provided that whenever the panel of petit jurors was exhausted, the trial court had to order the sheriff to summon a sufficient number of persons possessing the qualifications of jurors to complete the number requisite for a jury in that particular case. What the Constitution secured was the right of trial by an impartial jury, as constituted at common law, and when the right was secured defendant's constitutional protection was completely secured.

The trial court found that the statute was an unconstitutional invasion of individual rights without a compelling interest in the State. The court held that there was no unconstitutional vagueness in the statute. The words of the statute, taken in their ordinary meaning, proved entirely adequate to inform the public of what was forbidden. In addition, the right of privacy was merely implied in the U.S. Constitution. The State had the right to protect the right of an embryo or fetus. Furthermore, the court found that the State had a legitimate interest to legislate for the purpose of affording an embryonic or fetal organism an opportunity to survive. It had and on balance it was superior to the claimed right of a pregnant woman or anyone else to destroy the fetus except when necessary to preserve her own life.

However, the sheriff's return on the arrest warrant was not delivered until March 1970. Defendant was brought before the trial court three days later. A preliminary hearing was held in July 1970. The trial was held in October 1970 and defendant was found guilty of first-degree robbery and sentenced to 10 years in prison. On appeal, defendant argued that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court reversed, finding that defendant was denied his right to a speedy trial. The court found that that the State knew that defendant was in custody for two years and that he could be brought to trial without much difficulty. The court found that defendant made numerous requests to be brought to trial and that the state's attorney was aware of the demands.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant consented to have a chemical analysis of his blood to determine its alcoholic content. He was taken to a hospital where a laboratory technician withdrew the blood sample. At trial, the trial court refused to submit to the jury a pattern jury instruction stating that a person was under the influence if he was affected to an appreciable degree and instead instructed the jury that it was not essential that defendant have been so intoxicated that he could not have safely driven the car. On appeal, the court held that the complaint was not insufficient for failing to cite the statute because it described the offense in such a manner that it made clear what was intended. The blood alcohol test results were not inadmissible on the ground that the blood was not drawn by a licensed person because S.D. Codified Laws &sect;32-23-14 only required doctors and nurses to have been licensed and specifically included laboratory technicians in that group of people qualified to draw blood for blood alcohol analysis. The court also held that the jury instruction was proper because the pattern instruction placed a burden on the State to prove an element that did not exist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The land involved less than three percent of the district's assessed value. A parent, who was a petitioner for the change of boundary, resided on the land detached, and his children not being able to attend an elementary school in the district attended an elementary school in the district, which acquired the land. The court found that the two requirements of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 13-6-85 were met. The value of land detached was well within the five percent limit and the petition for change of the boundary was signed by all the electors thereof. The petitioner's children were compelled to attend a school in a district where he had no right to vote for its officers or on any issues that arose and had no voice in the operation or conduct of the school. Furthermore, shortly before the sections of land were taken from the district, eight sections had been added to it. From these facts the court concluded that the board did not abuse its discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his conviction of driving while under the influence of alcohol, defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred as a matter of law in admitting into evidence certain exhibits relating to the taking and testing of his blood sample. The court noted that there was ample evidence in the record, including the testimony of the arresting officer and the result of a blood alcohol test which indicated that the sample of blood taken shortly after defendant's arrest contained .19 percent alcohol by weight, to support the jury's verdict of guilty. The court refused to consider defendant's argument that S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 32-23-14 was vague and unconstitutional because defendant failed to raise the question of constitutionality at trial. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial on the ground that the trial court no longer had jurisdiction over the case. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court held that even if the trial court had jurisdiction to entertain the motion, the trial court did not err in denying the motion because defendant failed to ask the appellate court to remand his record to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that a local ordinance was drafted in such a manner as to conform with the requirements, recommendations, rules, and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration and the State Aeronautics Commission. The court did not believe that any private operator could acquire an interest in land owned, controlled, and occupied by a city as a public airport under the provisions of S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 50-7 that prohibited a city from imposing fees for the continued private use of the airport for commercial flying purposes. There was nothing in the record to support a finding that the city ratified any agreement with the flying service whereby he acquired property rights at the airport which prohibited city from imposing commercial fees upon him. So long as the fees authorized by a resolution were applied to all who come within the purview of the fee schedule, the court could not say that the fee schedule was discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The store allowed the customer to purchase merchandise on credit under a revolving charge account agreement. That the one and one-half percent monthly charge frequently exceeded the eight percent per annum maximum interest rate allowed in South Dakota was undisputed. The court held that the store's revolving charge account agreement resulted in usury, which was prohibited under S.D. Codified Laws &sect; 54-3-7. The agreement constituted a forbearance by the store to collect money from the customer. The forbearance resulted in an interest charge above the statutory maximum and was thus prohibited. The store's intent to violate the law was evident because the agreement was usurious on its face. The court overturned the judgment pertaining to the class action because the trial court had definitively denied permission to proceed as a class action. That absolute denial could not be reviewed once the time for an appeal expired. The court concluded that its holding, that the use of revolving charge account agreements which resulted in charges exceeding maximum legal interest were in violation of the usury statutes, was prospective in effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, resident electors of defendant school district, sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Lincoln County (South Dakota), which held that a school bond election of February 3, 1970 had failed of passage, and that an election of March 3, 1970 was valid and authorized the sale of bonds as provided for in that election in lieu of bonds authorized at an election of June 24, 1969.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first election authorized bonds bearing a specified interest rate to construct an addition to the district's high school. No attempt was made to sell those bonds because the district's marketing agent advised there was no market for the bonds. The second election sought the same amount of debt, but authorized a higher interest rate. The bond election was approved by less than 60 percent of the electors. The third election sought a higher bond amount at a higher interest rate in lieu of the amount authorized by the first election. On appeal, the court found no error by the trial court. The requirement that a school bond election be passed by a super-majority, as required by S.D. Codified Laws &sect;13-19-16 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and S.D. Const. art. VI, &sect; 19. Electors in the third election were not voting to rescind the first election because the original proposal had ceased to exist as a basis for action by the school board. The ballot for the third election did not contain two separate propositions. The district substantially complied with the requirements of S.D. Codified Laws &sect;13-8-35.</SPAN></P>

But if defendant was acquitted or the prosecution was otherwise unsuccessful, the municipality had to pay the costs. In such event defendant was also entitled to tax costs against the municipality, but in cases tried to a police magistrate the taxable costs would not exceed the sum of two dollars.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of conviction entered by the Stanley County Circuit Court (South Dakota) after a jury verdict finding appellant guilty of violating state blue sky laws, in connection with his high-pressure securities sales.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was the organizer of a fast food corporation. Appellant and a licensed agent went to the complainant's home to sell corporate stock to her. During their visit, the complainant revealed that she was having tax difficulties. Appellant promised to help the woman with her tax matters if she purchased his stocks, and stayed at her house all night until she finally purchased $ 6,000 worth of shares. Appellant was later indicted under 1961 S.D. Laws 270, &sect; 23(5) for selling securities which worked a fraud upon the public. Appellant challenged his conviction. The court affirmed the conviction because appellant's failure to make a disclosure by withholding material facts, was as serious a misrepresentation as an oral or written misrepresentation. The court ruled that appellant's failure to give the complainant a prospectus, or disclose material information regarding corporate finances, was evidence of guilt under state blue sky laws.</SPAN></P>
