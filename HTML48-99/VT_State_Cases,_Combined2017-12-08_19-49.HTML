</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Addison Superior Court (Vermont), which convicted him of armed robbery in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 608 and of being a habitual criminal in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 11, and sentenced him to serve three life terms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to three life sentences as a habitual offender, he appealed numerous claimed procedural and evidentiary errors during his trial. The court affirmed his convictions and sentences, holding that many of the issues raised on appeal were not preserved by objection during the trial, and none of those claimed errors were constitutional violations that were otherwise reviewable under the plain error doctrine. Admission of the photographic array that had been shown to an eyewitness by the police was proper because defendant's counsel failed to object and the identification procedure did not reveal a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. Defendant's false alibi statement to the police was properly admitted as a spontaneous statement. The prosecutor did not violate defendant's Fifth Amendment rights by threatening him with more serious charges if he refused to plead guilty to lesser charges, and the prosecutor's retaliatory comments were properly within the scope of rebuttal. Imposition of three life sentences was proper because they were imposed at the same time and ran concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for armed robbery and being a habitual offender, and it also affirmed the imposition of three life sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following the denial of their request to house a small used car business in a garage on their property, plaintiff landowners instituted an action against defendant town seeking damages and injunctive and declaratory relief. The landowners appealed the decision of the Washington Superior Court (Vermont), which denied their motion for summary judgment, denied their claim for damages, and granted the town's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners argued that the town, in adopting or attempting to adopt its zoning ordinance, failed to comply with the provisions of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect;&sect; 4301-4493 and that, even if summary judgment was correctly denied, it was error thereafter to exclude evidence of this claimed failure at the hearing on the merits. The landowners also argued that the denial of their claim for damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 constituted error. The court held that neither the contention that summary judgment was improperly denied nor that the evidence was improperly excluded fell within the requirements of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 4472(b) because that section limited actions for review to constitutional challenges to a zoning by-law or development plan. The court also held that because the landowners made no claim of malice in the denial of the permit, the mere allegation that town officers acted under the authority of an allegedly invalid zoning ordinance did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision in favor of the town in the landowners' action challenging the denial of their request to house a small used car business in a garage on their property.</SPAN></P>

The Washington Superior Court (Vermont) dismissed the action, holding that the Department of Motor Vehicles, in issuing the plates, followed a duly promulgated regulation which did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation had applied to the Department requesting that its company vehicle be assigned a license plate with numerals 101, 102, or 103. The application was denied on the basis of a regulation that &quot;reserved&quot; numbers below 10,001 to prior holders and their families. The corporation filed suit requesting that the Commissioner be ordered to issue low number plates on a first-come, first-served basis. The trial court dismissed the claim. On appeal, the corporation alleged that the regulation was invalid and that it was beyond the statutory authority delegated to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. Subsequent to the trial court's judgment, the Vermont General Assembly had added a subsection to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 304 effectively incorporating the regulation. The court dismissed the cause. The court found that (1) because the addition to &sect; 304 had transformed the corporation's claims of error into hypothetical questions not arising upon existing facts, the claims were moot; and (2) because the corporation had obtained a low number license plate within the &quot;reserve group,&quot; it no longer had standing to attack the law as violative of the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

They alleged that the amendment to the town's zoning law amounted to a confiscation of their property without due process of law and a denial of the equal protection of the laws. The trial court declared the amendment unconstitutional, and the town appealed. The court reversed the order of the trial court. The court found that: (1) the zone was an island in a residential area; (2) the rezoning narrowed the available business uses; and (3) among the purposes put forth at the hearings and meetings were preservation of the neighborhood character of the area and prevention of commercial development as had occurred in the past. The court held that the trial court's view of the town's action that tended to prevent expansion of nonresidential use and limit commercial use, as contrary to the public good could not be sustained. The court ruled that there was no constitutional shortcoming in the reclassification of the zone.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer argued that the &quot;piggyback&quot; features of the gift tax statute were unconstitutional. In considering the constitutionality of the statute, the court held that the statute, insofar as it extended a $ 30,000 exemption from the gift tax to some taxpayers while withholding it from the taxpayer denied equal protection and was therefore unconstitutional; the taxpayer was permitted to recompute his gift tax liability. However, the court held that the use of federal gift tax liability in computing Vermont gift tax liability, although it classified taxpayers according to past activity, was reasonable and did not result in a denial of equal protection. The court further held that the Vermont taxing scheme had a retroactive elements; however, the taxpayer did not demonstrate that the tax was sufficiently oppressive and harsh so as to require the court to declare the gift tax law unconstitutional.

The inmate filed a petition seeking a declaratory judgment requiring the Commissioner of Corrections to consider him for good time credit purportedly accumulated during his confinement as a psychopathic personality. The trial court entered an order dismissing the petition. The court affirmed the order, holding that (1) the trial court had no jurisdiction to consider the petition under Vt. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At 3 A.M., an officer saw defendants sitting on a lawn in front of and in the headlights of an out-of-state vehicle. The officer stopped his car and asked what defendants were doing; defendants refused to answer the question and responded loudly with obscenities. After the officer and another officer made the same inquiry and received the same responses, defendants were arrested and charged with making unreasonable noise with the intent to cause public inconvenience and annoyance and to recklessly create a risk thereof. On appeal, the court rejected defendants' claim that the officers' conduct constituted an illegal stop and seizure because it was without reasonable or probable cause and the subsequent arrest was the &quot;fruit&quot; of an impermissible seizure. The court ruled that the stop and temporary seizure were not constitutionally impermissible and the actions of defendants provided an independent basis for arrest. The court ruled, however, that the State failed to prove all the essential elements of either of the conjunctively pled charges. The State failed to prove intent and failed to prove the unreasonableness of the noise or any risk of public inconvenience and annoyance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Commissioner, Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles appealed from the finding of the Orleans Superior Court (Vermont), that under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 801(a)(4), a conviction based upon a nolo plea did not provide an indication of fault, and that, if an individual so requested, the convicted individual had to have been afforded a hearing on the question of fault prior to suspension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff drivers had pled nolo contendere in cases involving the motor vehicles laws. They sought to secure a judicial interpretation of &sect; 801(a)(4) that because their convictions were based on nolo contendere pleas they should have been given a hearing before the Commissioner on the issue of fault before having been subjected to the provisions of the financial responsibility law. The trial court agreed with the drivers. The court struck the judgment and held that the drivers were not entitled to a hearing. What was involved was the fact of conviction, not the plea upon which the conviction was secured. The financial responsibility requirements were not predicated upon an admission of guilt by a plea of nolo or of guilty, but upon conviction on any plea of an accident-related offense, required to have met constitutional mandates by involving an element causative of the accident. It was neither the plea taken as an admission, nor the conviction sought to have been used as proof of underlying facts, which triggered the operation of the financial responsibility law. It was, rather, the fact of the fault-related conviction itself, which sent the statutory requirements into effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court struck the trial court's judgment and ruled that the drivers and other similarly situated individuals were not entitled to hearing before the Commissioner before becoming subject to the provisions of the financial responsibility law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a judgment of the Washington Superior Court (Vermont), which, in the taxpayer's appeal of an assessment by the State, declared the value of its railroad's equipment, 21.94 miles of track and ties, and real estate. The various amounts arrived at were based on the testimony of an expert appraiser.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer's attack centered first on the appraisal statute itself. It argued that the statutory standard of &quot;fair and just value&quot; used in both Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect;&sect; 8281, 8361 was constitutionally infirm because no specific standards were set out. The court held that the phrase &quot;fair market value&quot; was the appropriate construction of &quot;fair and just value&quot; in the context of the statute. The testimony of the state appraiser indicated the use of the income approach, cost approach, and profit and loss approach. He testified that he sought to arrive at fair market value of the property. He used comparable properties in his valuation of the real estate. He also took into account the concept of &quot;highest and best use.&quot; His testimony was that the income approach would not reflect market value because the railroad did not have freight revenues. Because most of the property had been acquired in the early twentieth century, the cost approach was rejected as not giving guidance to fair market value. The court found that the evaluation of the various approaches was consistent with case law, and there was no violation of any equal protection concerns. The appraisal below was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the superior court.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 19, &sect;&sect; 461, 931 to have certain highways reclassified from Class 4 to Class 3. The trial court found that the other highways within the town serving two or fewer full-time residents, and other highways presenting similar maintenance problems, had either been classified Class 3, or, if classified Class 4, had been maintained at all seasons. Further, the trial court found that any impediments to routine maintenance were within the capabilities of the town without undue burden or expense. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's findings. The court found that other roads, with terrain and construction features equally difficult, were maintained by the town at all seasons. Thus, the highways in question could have also been maintained without undue burden and with equipment readily available. The trial court was justified, upon the evidence, in finding that the highways were travelled highways meeting the minimum standards under Vt. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant wildlife corporation sought review of a decision by the Vermont Environmental Board, which entered judgment in favor of appellees, an adjoining landowner, town planning commissions, and an agency of environmental conservation, and vacated an order of a district environmental commission granting the corporation a land use permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation filed an application for a land use permit for the construction of a game farm. After the commission granted the application, the Board vacated the commission's order, concluding that there was a reasonable probability that the development would result in undue air and water pollution, that it would cause unreasonable soil erosion, and that it would unreasonably endanger the public investment in public lands. On appeal, the court held that the corporation had the burden of proving that the proposed development would not cause the damage to the environment stated by the Board. The court found that appellees produced evidence showing a reasonable probability that contaminants from animal waste and sedimentation would reach streams running through the proposed development. The court noted that the corporation did not propose any system for the treatment or control of surface run-off. The court concluded that there existed substantial evidence to support the findings that, were the game farm to be constructed, a reasonable probability would exist that undue water pollution, unreasonable soil erosion, and reduction in capacity of the land to hold water would result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sister of a decedent sought review of an order of the Probate Court, Washington County (Vermont), which, after allowing for dispositions under the will to the sister and appellee wife of the decedent as well as for the sale of real estate, distributed the remaining cash assets pursuant to state law. The sister argued that state law did not apply because the decedent was domiciled in another state at the time of his death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent was domiciled in another state but owned real and personal property in the state. Under his will, he left half his estate to the sister; the other half was left in trust for the wife. After the decedent's death, the will was allowed and real estate was sold. The probate court then distributed the remaining cash assets in accordance with state law. The sister appealed, arguing that the law of the state where the decedent was domiciled at the time of death applied; she also argued that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 1067, governing probate settlements, was unconstitutional because it did not mandate personal notice whenever possible. The court initially noted that the sister had the right to appeal, even though she had not appeared in any probate proceedings. Also, while not necessary to disposition of the case, the court noted that the probate court's use of publication instead of personal notice was not the best notice possible under &sect; 1067. The court then held that the decedent's remaining personal property should have been distributed pursuant to the law of the state where he was domiciled at the time of his death; thus, the probate court erred in applying state law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order distributing the decedent's remaining assets in accordance with state law and remanded to the probate court for application of the law of the state where the decedent was domiciled at the time of his death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was detained in New Hampshire, where he was arrested for possession of burglary tools. He later confessed to Vermont police officers to the burglary of a garage in Vermont. On appeal, defendant contended that his confession and certain other evidence should have been excluded by the trial court because of the alleged unconstitutionality of the New Hampshire detention statute,&nbsp;N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 594:2. Defendant further asserted that the trial court erred by refusing to give his jury charge as to the voluntariness of his confession. The court declined to decide the constitutionality of &sect; 594:2. Rather, the court held that the evidence, other than the confession, properly was admitted because the New Hampshire police officers acted in good faith reliance on the statute's validity. However, the court further held that the trial court committed reversible error by deciding the issue of the voluntariness of defendant's confession and by submitting only the credibility issue to the jury. The court reasoned that the so-called &quot;Massachusetts rule,&quot; under which the voluntariness issue was for the jury, was preferable to the &quot;orthodox&quot; rule followed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff judges initiated action for extraordinary relief with the court pursuant to Vt. R. App. P. 21 against defendant county clerks. The judges sought injunctive relief to prevent the county clerks from excluding the judges from the ballot for reelection. The county clerks refused to put the judges' names on the ballot on account of their age being 70 years or over as prohibited by Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 28c.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 28c specifically provided that all judges shall be retired at the end of the calendar year in which they attain 70 years or age or at the end of the term of election during which they attain 70 years of age. The county clerks asserted that the judges were disqualified by reason of age. The judges contended that ch. II, &sect; 28c was unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV on the ground that the classification on the eligibility of candidacy for the office of judge based upon age was a suspect criterion. The court disagreed and denied the judges' petition for relief. The court held that mandatory judicial retirement was a proper exercise of a constitutional limitation in order to hold the judiciary to the highest possible standards. The court noted that the intent of the mandatory retirement was not fear of the disability itself, but the lack of recognition of such disability by the individual who would continue to preside in the face of such disqualification. The people of Vermont saw this as a legitimate concern, and made mandatory judicial retirement at 70 a dictate of the Vermont Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minor and his friends had allegedly stolen the owner's car and negligently damaged it. During a custodial interrogation following the incident, the minor signed a statement confessing to his involvement in the incident. Juvenile criminal proceedings were brought against the minor, although he was not by definition a juvenile at the time of the offense. During trial on the owner's claim, the minor's signed statement was admitted into evidence. The minor argued that the statement was inadmissible as a part of his juvenile record. The trial court denied the minor's motion to exclude the evidence and the court reversed. The court found that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 33, &sect;&sect; 662(e), 663, protected the confidentiality of records in juvenile cases. The court held that even though the minor's objection at trial was not based on these statutes, the trial judge should have been on notice himself as to the circumstances and the applicable law. The court found that the trial court was sufficiently alerted to the minor's claimed error that it had a fair opportunity to correct itself if it chose. Thus, it was the trial court's duty to exclude the statement.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 13, 7554(a), which required a court to determine whether the release of a defendant pending trial would constitute a danger to the public. The court further noted the various conditions that could be imposed upon the release of a defendant in order to negate the danger to the public. The court held that whether to impose physically restrictive conditions of release upon a defendant whose release had been determined to constitute a danger to the public was a decision that was to be made only in extraordinary circumstances and founded upon adequate findings of fact. The court concluded that the order of the district court failed to comply with the requirements of the statute and that the district court was also to be given the opportunity to impose such conditions of release as it deemed proper in light of the views expressed by the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the case to the district court so that conditions of release could be imposed in accordance with the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that it was not inappropriate for the legislature to draw the districts generally along county lines, that the plan met federal standards, and that the plan resulted in no invidious discrimination. Further, the court noted that it was proper for the legislature, in drafting the plan, to take into account the state's geography, the distribution and size of the state's population, the state's transportation network, and the impediments of the state's winter climate. The court also found that the severance of certain towns from their county did not render the plan invalid. Further, the court found that the 15 percent guideline of Vt. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The real estate broker was assessed for unpaid unemployment contributions by the Commissioner of Employment Security because of the employment of salespeople. The real estate broker requested a hearing claiming that it was not subject to unemployment compensation tax because the salespeople were paid entirely on a commission basis. A referee affirmed the Commissioner's assessment. The real estate broker appealed to the Employment Security Board, which affirmed the referee's decision. The real estate broker appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed and ruled that the real estate broker was subject to unemployment compensation contributions because beyond the selling or renting of their own homes, the salespeople had no independent real estate business that they could operate independently of their employer, the real estate broker. Thus, the real estate broker failed to satisfy the provisions of Vt. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 604 violated both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, in that it failed to provide for hearing before the commissioner prior to his suspensions of the operator's licenses and that such suspensions for the failure to pay a poll tax did not bear a rational relationship or compelling interest to public safety. The court held that a permanent injunction was improperly granted. The facts presented in all of the drivers' situations showed a failure to either adequately notify them of the penalty of operator's license suspension for nonpayment of the poll tax or to provide a hearing when requested. Thus, the trial court was correct in granting a preliminary injunction prohibiting the suspension of the licenses. However, a further remedy existed for the drivers because each municipality had authorized and established a board for the abatement of taxes. Thus, the court continued the injunction only until the individual drivers had the opportunity to be heard by a board of abatement, which would make a final determination on the suspensions.</SPAN></P>

In reviewing the sponsor's statement the court found that the primary purpose of providing partial funding for property tax relief by imposing the tax was constitutional, and that the taxpayer had not overcome the presumption of constitutionality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time that the employee accepted the transfer she had a car and could travel between home and work.

Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 1343(a)(3). On appeal, the court held that the employee left her job without good cause because the employer was not responsible for providing her with transportation to her job site. Further, the court agreed with the Board's decision that the employee was not available for work. The court rejected the employee's claim that the Board had discriminated against her on the basis of a classification of wealth. The court stated that the employee's benefits were not denied merely because she did not own a car, but that the decision was based on many other factors including the type of work she sought and the availability of that work. The court ruled that her classification as unavailable for benefits had a rational basis and was constitutionally sound. The court decided that the employee did not have an unqualified right to benefits simply because she did not have transportation.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the hearing held in the county court concluded that defendant was not a psychopathic personality and ordered him discharged from confinement as such. Therefore the order of which defendant complained had in fact granted him the relief which he sought. In addition, there was no merit to defendant's claim that he should have been entitled to immediate release because he received no treatment or rehabilitation services while in confinement as a psychopathic personality. The county court had discharged him from such confinement and defendant did not challenge his sentence imposed upon his manslaughter conviction. The court further found that neither the determination of good time credit nor determinations concerning parole were proper areas for the county court to render an opinion. Finally, under &sect; 7131 et seq., the only question properly before the county court was whether the sentence of defendant was invalid or improperly imposed. As a result, the omission of any reference to the effect of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 28, &sect;&sect; 501 and 811 was proper.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought to have the information quashed on the grounds that &sect; 1026(3) was unconstitutionally vague and an infringement on liberties guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. I. On appeal, the court held that the question under certification was only as to the constitutionality of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 1026(3) in the abstract. While the statute might have been found to have a constitutional infirmity under one set of circumstances, possibly a different answer might be given under another set of circumstances. There was nothing in the record to shed any light on the factual situation out of which the certified question arose. The decision of the constitutionality of &sect; 1026(3) depended on the factual situation that was developed in the trial of the case and without such facts the appeal was improvidently granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners obtained a permit under the Protective Zoning Ordinance of the town to construct a barn from which they would operate what was generally known as a stable business. Four years later, the landowners began to conduct barn dances at the barn on a not for profit basis as a means of drawing attention to their horse and stable business. The zoning board of adjustment denied an application made by the landowners for a permit to conduct the dances. At the time the action was commenced, the landowners intended to begin conducting the dances for profit. On appeal, the court held that because of the Town of Westford, Vt., Protective Zoning Ordinance &sect;&sect; 4, 7 failed to prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards to be followed in appropriate cases as they were required to, the sections had to be found invalid for their failure to comply with Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 3014. The court found that the Town of Westford, Vt., Protective Zoning Ordinance &sect; 4 had to also fail for its failure to comply with the provisions of its enabling act, Vt. Stat.

The driver sought to have an order of defendant district court judge vacated on the basis that it unlawfully required him to surrender his Vermont operator's license. While the case was pending, a temporary injunction was in effect. Defendant Commissioner of Motor Vehicles was joined as a party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver was charged under Vt. Stat. ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1201 for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. A state police officer read provisions of the Vermont implied consent law, but the driver did not submit to a blood-alcohol test. The driver entered a plea of not guilty to the driving offense, and he was later ordered to surrender his driver's license in the instant proceeding. He claimed that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1205 was unconstitutional on its face. On review, the court found that the statute was unconstitutional in part. The court concluded that the driver was denied due process and equal protection under the United States and Vermont Constitutions because &sect; 1205 resulted in a suspension of an operator's license only for those who pleaded not guilty following failure to comply with the implied consent law. It did not apply if a person pleaded guilty. The court held that the entire statute was not invalid but only that part of &sect; 1205 dealing with an &quot;arraignment entered upon a plea of not guilty.&quot; Otherwise, the provision that a driver impliedly consented to having a blood alcohol test and could be subject to a license suspension remained intact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the relief requested to the extent that it required the district court judge to set aside his ruling and that the court invalidated a part of Vermont's implied consent law. The driver was not required to surrender his motor vehicle operator's license.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that it was the clear intent of the legislature that the taxpayer's tax base include the gross-up, and found no error in the trial court's finding that the taxpayer's taxable state income was measured by the taxable income as shown on its federal tax return. The court concluded that the taxation formula as applied to the taxpayer was constitutional. The court stated that it was error for the trial court to disregard evidence that the taxpayer's foreign investments represented approximately half of its total operations and assets.

The trial court granted the city's petition for injunctive relief, and the court affirmed that decree. The court held that the business failed to show by clear and irrefragable evidence that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court noted that the city sought to reduce the noise and to maintain order in an area where such was known to occur. The court held that the ordinance was a reasonable exercise of the police power. The court found that the classification set forth by the city in the ordinance was in substantial compliance with the Auclair test because it conferred a public benefit on its citizens in a residential zone while providing a minimal impact upon the business. The court noted that the ordinance compelled that to be done that had been agreed to and it did not lie with the business to say that no condition being attached to the variance granted it any absolute rights in the operation of its enterprise.</SPAN></P>

In his application for a writ of habeas corpus, petitioner alleged that at the time his mother was appointed his guardian ad litem, she was incompetent to act as such because she was mentally ill and under psychiatric treatment and a conflict of interest existed between her and petitioner. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that: (1) pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 7136, if petitioner wanted to collaterally attack the proceedings below, he had to first apply for postconviction relief under Vt. Stat.

The teacher was suspended. Thereafter, two teachers participated in a protest over the pending dismissal of their fellow teacher. These teachers were also suspended. All three teachers were subsequently dismissed. Upon writ of certiorari, the court held that the petition to the school board for the purpose of having a class discussion was not &quot;conduct unbecoming a teacher&quot; within the meaning of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 1752. Therefore, the board was without authority to dismiss the teacher for exercising her first amendment right. However, the teachers that participated in the protest failed in their duties within the meaning of &sect; 1752 and were properly dismissed. It was irrelevant that the orders to return to class were made by the principal rather than the superintendent because there was neither time nor occasion to refer the decision to the board for approval and the direct communication to the teachers occurred during an emergency situation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Windham County Court (Vermont) certified to the court the question of whether Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 592, which required six months residency prior to filing a divorce libel, denied libellant wife due process and equal protection of the law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Libellee was the husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife filed a libel for divorce after she had been a Vermont resident for three months. Section 592 required that an individual be resident for six months before a libel could be brought. The trial court granted the husband's motion to dismiss but did not enter a judgment of dismissal based on its ruling; rather, it certified the question at issue to the court. In answering the question in the negative, the court held that state had the absolute right to prescribe the conditions upon which the marriage relation between its own citizens could be created and the causes for which it could be dissolved. Taking that view with the strong public policy favoring the preservation of the marriage relationship, the &quot;compelling&quot; nature of the state's interest in requiring a reasonable deferral of an application to dissolve a marriage was adequately demonstrated. It was in line with that interest for the state to require a reexamination by the parties of their marital situation after a move to the state to determine whether the move might somehow cure the discord.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court answered the certified question in the negative and remanded the cause to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that because defendant failed to show that his right to the grand jury testimony rested on something stronger than affording him an opportunity to know and prepare to meet the testimony, the trial court properly denied the request. Although &sect; 4803 stated that defendant was to be observed by the superintendent while he was in the state hospital, the examination conducted by the private physician was a permissible delegation of duty. The court held that the continuation of the investigation the next morning was not unreasonable because it was routine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State's Attorney of Orleans County, Vermont brought a petition representing that appellant juvenile was a delinquent child. The District Court, Unit No. 4, Orleans Circuit (Vermont) found that the juvenile was a delinquent and overruled the juvenile's motion to dismiss. The juvenile appealed from the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the State's petition, the claim of delinquency was that the juvenile operated a pickup truck without the consent of its owner. The juvenile contended that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 33, &sect; 654 permitted proof of delinquency by a lower quantum of evidence, which was the preponderance standard. Though the trial judge required proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the juvenile contended that the statute was constitutionally deficient and that the deficiency was not overcome by the trial court's adoption of the higher standard of proof. Section 654 provided that if a court found that allegations made in the petition had been established, it should find the child delinquent. Where criminal conduct was involved the word &quot;established&quot; meant proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Because &sect; 654 did not offend the fundamental requirements of due process, the court could supply by implication the inherent requirement that &quot;established,&quot; meant &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; where a juvenile was charged with an act which would constitute a crime if committed by an adult. Because the trial court adopted the higher standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the juvenile's constitutional rights were safeguarded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a department store, sought review of its conviction by the District Court, Unit No. 3, Franklin Circuit (Vermont) of eight counts of violating the provisions of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 3301, the Sunday closing law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The indictment charged that defendant sold eight items, including a gallon of paint, a paint brush, a cake plate, and a box of Christmas cards, on a Sunday. Defendant argued that &sect; 3301 was unconstitutional and that the fact that it was open for business on a Sunday should constitute one, rather than several, violations. On appeal, the court rejected all of defendant's contentions. Despite their religious origins, the Sunday closing law had evolved into a mandatory day of rest and recreation. The fact that an exception was made for Sabbatarians did not change that fact. The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses were not contravened because there was a rational relationship between the purpose of the statute, the encouragement of relaxation, and the items exempted. The statute was not constitutionally vague. And defendant was correctly charged with a violation for each sale made. To charge a store one time for each illegal day of operation would transform the closing law into a licensing statute and would make violation of the statute profitable business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bank agreed to buy notes issued by the agency for the purpose of providing mortgages for families of low income. The bank refused to fulfill its commitment to purchase the notes. The bank argued that the statutes, 10 Vt. Stat. Ann. ch. 11B, allowing the agency to issue the notes were unconstitutional because they served a private rather than a public purpose and because they unlawfully delegated legislative power to the agency. The court ordered that a decree be issued in favor of the agency, holding that the statutes were constitutional. The government's participation in a project to improve housing conditions was a proper objective of its police power. The fulfillment of the statutory purpose conferred a general public benefit because the general welfare of the State was served by efforts to provide safe, adequate, and sufficient housing for its citizens. The court also held that the statutes authorizing the agency provided basic standards against arbitrary and capricious administration. They did not empower the agency to act as a lawmaker, but granted a discretionary authority to implement the statutory directive within the bounds fixed by the statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged in the District Court, Unit No. Five, Orange Circuit (Vermont), with a violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 4705(b), which made it a criminal offense to carry a loaded rifle or shotgun in a vehicle on a public highway without a special permit. The trial court certified questions to the court before trial to determine if the statute violated Vt. Const. art. 16 and if the statute had general application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged under a complaint that did not allege that he was hunting and did not set forth a particular statutory subsection. The court held that the language of Vt. Const. art. 16 did not suggest that the right to bear arms was unlimited and undefinable, so that a statute that required that two particular kinds of weapons, at certain specific places and under limited circumstances, be carried unloaded rather than loaded, was not such an infringement on the constitutional right to bear arms as to make the statute invalid. The court noted that without facts it could not rule on constitutionality as applied. The court found that although the statute was part of the fish and games laws, it was enacted pursuant to the police power of the legislature and was intended to be a statute of general application that did not require a person to be hunting to violate it. The court also found the complaint to be sufficient because it clearly described the crime. The court declined to address a Fourteenth Amendment equal protection question and a question as to the definitions in the statute because defendant had not briefed the issues and therefore waived them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the statute and the particular subsection dealing with possession of a loaded weapon in a vehicle did not violate the right to bear arms under the state constitution. The court held that the statute was one of general application.</SPAN></P>

The debtor contended that the trial court should have granted his motion to dismiss the creditor's action because the trustee process was an unconstitutional deprivation of his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court affirmed, holding that the debtor's motion to dismiss the trustee process was properly denied because the attachment of a debtor's property, in the hands of a trustee, to satisfy a debt under a judgment was not a deprivation of property without due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment. By the trustee process, the debtor's wages were merely detained temporarily pending a final judgment and, until the creditor obtained a final judgment, the debtor's wages in the hands of the trustee were immune from the creditor's grasp.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Agency entered into leasing agreements with a private college and a religious-related college in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The Agency's chairman refused to execute the leases and issue revenue bonds on the grounds that the debentures would have been unmarketable because of constitutional infirmities in the Act. The Agency filed a petition under the Declaratory Judgment Act for relief against the chairman. A decree was entered for the Agency. On appeal, the decree was affirmed. The court found that to the extent that the colleges were aided in financing a public state educational program, there was no offense to Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 7th and 9th . The general public benefit was the dominant interest served by the lease agreements. The authority granted to the Agency through the Act was sufficiently restrained to constitute a permissible delegation of power within the requirements of the Vermont Constitution. The Act did not attempt to transfer law making power on the Agency. The Agency properly entered into a lease with the religious-related college. There was no primary effect that either advanced or inhibited religion through the function of the Agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with distributing advertising material for an educational service that was untrue, deceptive, and misleading. He elected to stand trial without a jury, and the waiver was announced in open court. On appeal, he claimed that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to try him because the materials in issue were written and printed elsewhere. The court rejected that argument and found that the trial court had jurisdiction because the materials were distributed locally. However, the court found that defendant should not have been convicted under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 2005 because of the denial of essential procedural safeguards. While the trial court may have had cause to find that there were false representations in the ad, the trial court improperly relied on character evidence related to defendant's philosophies and teaching in reaching a result. The court held that the consideration of such evidence was prejudicial. Moreover, the trial court miscast the burden of proof when it relied on findings that did not support the conviction under the theory on which it tried the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant allegedly participated with three others in a conspiracy to take a shopkeeper from his home to his store to rob it. The actual victim was a woman that entered the shopkeeper's home and was used to get the shopkeeper to open his store. Defendant allegedly stayed behind at the home with the victim's children while the others burglarized the store. Affirming, the court held that defendant's motion for a dismissal of the information was properly denied because the U.S. Const. amend. V requirement that &quot;infamous crimes&quot; be prosecuted by grand jury indictment was not binding on the states and Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 5652 allowed crimes that were not punishable by death or life imprisonment to be prosecuted by a state's attorney's information. The court also held that the search of an automobile relating to the incident was not unreasonable because it had been abandoned by defendant and his co-conspirators when their scheme was frustrated by police. The court determined that defendant's claim that he was only an aider and abettor was not factually or legally supported by the record, and that the evidence supported the convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff interstate school district filed an action against defendant intrastate school district. The controversy was fundamentally concerned with the enforceability of bonds issued by the town to finance its obligations to the interstate school district. The Windsor County Court (Vermont) certified two questions for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Legislation in both Vermont and New Hampshire authorized the creation of the interstate school district. The adjoining towns entered into an implementing agreement and the citizens of those towns confirmed the arrangements by vote. The main issue dealt with the towns' attempt to issue bonds to provide their proportionate share under a previously determined formula. The first question certified was whether 1963 Vt. Acts &amp; Resolves 240 involve an unconstitutional delegation of the sovereignty of the State of Vermont. The court answered the question in the negative and held that there was a valid interstate compact that arose out of counterpart legislation. Therefore, participation in the compact creating the interstate school district did not represent any unconstitutional delegation of sovereignty. The second question certified was whether the interstate school district was lawfully organized and in existence. The court answered that question affirmatively and held that with constitutional control preserved through the compact devise, the interstate school district was a lawfully organized entity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court answered the two certified questions and remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">According to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 230, the statute controlling awards from actions by the Board, &quot;each person&quot; had to be compensated. Defendants contended that the plain language of the statute required individual awards. The appellate court reversed. The Board was not a quasi-judicial agency that could have determined the rights between various parties in a condemnation action. If the legislature intended that the Board would be a tribunal, more than the &quot;each person&quot; language was required. Defendants' interpretation also violated the constitutional rule of the replacement of property by equivalence in money. Defendants' interpretation also violated the separation of powers doctrine. The court also reasoned that the use of the phrase &quot;land and rights&quot; throughout the condemnation statutes meant that the legislature referred to the interest the Board was seeking to acquire in land when the &quot;each person&quot; language was used so that the legislature was not referring to individual property interests. Thus, there was only one proceeding, and money damages passed to the person having the capacity to convey to others the interest acquired.</SPAN></P>

The second count informed that defendant transported a wild deer during close season. A witness heard a gunshot and observed a light in a field 300 feet away from her trailer. Before daylight on the same morning, a vehicle resembling one seen after the shot was in the area. A third witness observed it stop for a brief period. The witness later observed tire treads and the carcass of a small deer where the vehicle stopped. There was a spot of fresh blood on a bank nearby. Defendant admitted that he had driven in the area at the time. The tire marks conformed to the treads on his vehicle. The court reversed the denial of the directed verdict as to the first count and affirmed the denial on the second count. Only a strong suspicion linked defendant to the light observed. No flashlight was found in his possession, and his subsequent presence near the scene did not establish participation in the illegal use of the artificial light. However, defendant's admission that he was on the highway at the time was not refuted, and deer hair taken from his trunk matched that of the animal.</SPAN></P>

When the Board refused to certify the law student's moral character and fitness, the law student filed a petition for mandamus to compel the Board to permit him to take the bar examination. The court denied the petition, holding that the law student did not have a right to practice law because the practice of law in Vermont was not a profession open to all who wished to engage in it, unless qualified by legal training and moral fitness. It was not a natural, inherent, or vested right, or one guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment or Vt. Const. ch. 1, art. 4. The court found that the Board's adverse recommendation was viable because the investigation was sufficient to advise the Board of the law student's character and the determination was not a result of abuse of discretion, arbitrary action, fraud, corruption or oppression upon the part of the examiners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, the Attorney General of the State of Vermont, sought a writ of prohibition to restrain petitionees, three attorneys representing criminal defendants, from taking depositions for use in two murder cases under No. 217 of the Acts of 1957.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A justice of the peace caused to be issued notices of taking depositions requiring the Attorney General, the State's attorney for the county, and other individuals to attend. The trial court denied the Attorney General's request to stop the deposition. The court granted the petition for a temporary writ of prohibition. The court then ordered a writ of prohibition to issue, holding that 1957 Vt. Acts 217 did not authorize the taking of depositions in criminal cases. While that act stated that depositions could be taken &quot;by any part to any action,&quot; the construction put forth by the attorneys was not strict but expansive and its inclusiveness would be such that the State, on its part, would be free to take the depositions of the defendants. It would also abrogate Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, &sect;&sect; 2369 and 7484 which provided for the controlled secrecy of grand jury and inquest proceedings respectively. A writ of prohibition was the proper method to prevent the illegal assumption of authority. More than the mere administering of an oath was involved. The attorneys attempted to subject individuals to the compulsion of a law under which they purported to act, but without authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A writ of prohibition was ordered to issue, in the name of the State, signed by the Clerk, directed to the attorneys and prohibiting them from proceeding further in the taking of the proposed depositions or the depositions of any other persons in connection with the murder cases.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer challenged a determination made by the commissioner with respect to the Vermont franchise tax, which was assessed against the taxpayer, pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, &sect; 2124.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer was a Pennsylvania corporation authorized to engage in business in Vermont. During the calendar year at issue, the taxpayer received dividends from its subsidiaries, none of which did business in Vermont. In its Vermont franchise tax return, the taxpayer claimed a deduction for dividends received, which were denied by the commissioner. The taxpayer brought an action in the trial court, which sustained the commissioner's demurrer. On review, the court found no error. The court held that in its tax return, the taxpayer reported its income from dividends as part of its net income computation for its federal return. Therefore, it was an integral part of the computation of net income for purposes of allocation, even though the corporations from which the taxpayer received its dividends had no direct relationship with its business in Vermont. Further, the court found that the allocation factor was derived by strict compliance with statutory law and was the one supplied by the taxpayer in its return.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the taxpayer's motion for reargument and affirmed the findings of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company filed a proposed rate increase with the Commission to procure additional annual revenues. The Commission disapproved of the filed rates following a prehearing conference and formal hearings. A refund of revenues collected in excess of those permitted by the Commission's Vermont tariff in effect prior to the filing of the proposed rates was ordered. The company assigned error to the failure of the Commission to allow certain adjustments claimed for wage increases and amortization of extraordinary expenses incurred in prior years. The company contended the Commission's final order denied the company of its constitutional right to a fair hearing. The court held that there was support in the evidence for the ultimate finding by the Commission that while there had been wage scale adjustments and increased taxes and other expenses, the company's increased revenues had more than offset those adjustments and expenses. The court determined that the Commission could not approve of the new rates because the company failed to disclose what net earnings were required of a Vermont intrastate operation to support its proportionate share of the company's capital structure.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence supported defendant's conviction. The municipal court did not abuse its discretion in the admission of the doctor's testimony because it was a jury decision whether the delay helped or hurt the defense. Also, intoxication was relevant to defendant's negligence. Defendant waived the error regarding the admission of evidence of his having had alcohol on his breath because he failed to ask the municipal court to strike the testimony. Though defendant waived the error regarding the admission of photographs and highway diagrams because he did not object at trial, the photographs were admissible because they were accurate. Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on sudden emergency because he created the situation that caused the emergency. The oath to the jury was constitutional and did not require a guilty verdict, regardless of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 47, &sect; 6131, to remove the president of the liquor control board. The chancery court granted the president a temporary injunction restraining the governor from holding the hearing. The governor filed a petition for a writ of prohibition to prohibit the member from proceeding further with the injunction. The court held that the chancery court did not have jurisdiction to enjoin the removal of a public officer. The president argued that the chancery court did have jurisdiction because he was not given reasonable time to prepare for his defense in the removal proceedings and thus his due process rights were violated. The court found that the president was entitled to due process but that the proper procedure would have been to request additional time to prepare for his defense. It was not necessary for the president to go to the chancery court for a determination of his due process rights. Accordingly, the court granted the writ of prohibition to the governor and held that the governor was not required to proceed in the chancery court for a determination of his right under the removal statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs appealed from a judgment of the chancery court, Washington County (Vermont), which found that defendant Vermont State Fish and Game Commission had authority under 47 Vt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs excepted to the refusal of the chancellor to make findings of fact. They claimed that the chancellor's orders were not supported by the findings. They also claimed that the orders in issue were invalid under 47 Vt. Stat. &sect;&sect; 6570-6574 because the statutory provisions resulted in an unlawful delegation of power by the state legislature to the Commission. On review, the court found that plaintiffs waived the right to have the chancellor make findings when they agreed to have the case decided based only on the bill and the answer. The court upheld the laws underlying the chancellor's issuance of the wildlife protection orders. The delegation of power from the legislature to the Commission was lawful under Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 63. The Commission's authority to issue orders to protect wildlife permitted a proper exercise of the state's police power and actions taken for the public good. The court found that the disputed orders were in substantial compliance with 47 Vt. Stat. &sect; 6570.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 47, &sect; 6214, arising from the personal injuries caused by an intoxicated person to whom the restaurant owner sold or furnished intoxicating liquor. The owner asserted there was insufficient evidence of the person's apparent intoxication at the time he was served.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Liquor Control Board passed a regulation which provided that no alcoholic liquor could be sold or furnished to a person &quot;apparently under the influence of liquor.&quot; Section 6214 gave a person injured by an intoxicated person a right of action against the entity who sold or furnished the person the intoxicating liquor. A third party had been drinking heavily when he went to the owner's restaurant, where he drank one or two more beers. While there, he was staggering. When he left, he went to a filling station with his sister, who was holding him up. He was staggering and his speech was incomprehensible. He got into his car, drove on the wrong side of the street, and collided with plaintiff. The court held that there was ample evidence to support the jury's finding that the third party had been &quot;apparently under the influence&quot; of intoxicating liquor when the owner served him beer. The evidence of his intoxication at the filling station after leaving the bar was circumstantial evidence from which it was assumed that his condition was continuous. The court upheld the regulation, holding the Liquor Control Board was constitutionally delegated the duty to regulate sales of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

The builder, a foreign corporation, re-roofed the house and put metal edgings on the sides thereof. While so doing it negligently placed holes in the roof and sides of the buildings that caused it to leak water. The builder's motion to dismiss the homeowner's action was granted on the ground that the homeowner's complaint failed to recite the requisite jurisdictional facts. The builder sought to support the ruling on the ground that the complaint did not allege the existence of a duty on the part of the builder to the homeowner. The court disagreed and held that although the builder gratuitously made repairs, it was still liable to the homeowner. The court held that even a volunteer was liable for an injury negligently inflicted on the property of another. The law imposed an obligation upon everyone who attempted to do anything for another, even gratuitously, to exercise some degree of care and skill in the performance of what he had undertaken, for nonperformance of which duty an action lied.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner refused the request because the taxpayer had not received the required certificate of authority. The taxpayer appealed to the county court and the Commissioner filed a demurrer alleging that the county court was without jurisdiction. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that because the words &quot;may appeal&quot; in 1939 Vt. Acts &amp; Resolves 35, &sect; 17 were permissive, and because Pub. L. No. 909 provided that the county court was the proper venue in actions involving non-residents, the appeal was properly brought in the county court. The court agreed, holding that the taxpayer was not precluded from bringing an appeal in the court in the county of the Commissioner's residence. The court found that to hold otherwise would result in arbitrary discrimination against non-residents. Nevertheless, the court held that the county court had no jurisdiction because the taxpayer failed to adhere to the provisions of 1939 Vt.
