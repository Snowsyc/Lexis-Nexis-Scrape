</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent landowners brought a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that the statute allowing condemnation for development of the World Trade Center was unconstitutional. Subsequently, appellant port authority brought a condemnation proceeding. The lower court denied respondents' motion for temporary injunction, but the appellate court reversed. The appellate court also reversed the lower court's decision granting the petition for condemnation and order of possession and dismissed the condemnation proceeding. The court reversed, finding that improvement of the port by facilitating the flow of commerce and centralizing all activity incident thereto was a public purpose supporting the condemnation of property for any activity functionally related to that purpose. Further, the public purpose of the development as a whole was not vitiated by allowing portions of structures otherwise devoted to project purposes to be used for the production of incidental revenue for the expenses of all or part of the port development project. Finally, the condemnation procedures prescribed by statute fully protected respondents against any taking for nonpublic purposes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State of New York (L. 1921, ch. 154, as amd.) and the State of New Jersey by concurrent legislation created a Port of New York Authority and empowered the Authority to develop the port and to submit supplemental or amendatory plans for such development to the Legislatures of the two States; and Congress consented thereto (U. S. Const., art. I, &sect; 10; 42 U.S. Stat. 174, 822).  Such congressional consent is deemed to include a recent plan (in New York, L. 1962, ch. 209; in New Jersey, L. 1962, ch. 8) under which the Authority has organized a subsidiary corporation to condemn and acquire (a) the Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad system and (b) an area of about 13 blocks in lower Manhattan to be entirely reconstructed as a World Trade Center except that &quot;portions of such buildings, structures, improvements and areas may * * * be devoted to * * * the production of incidental revenue * * * for the expenses of all or part of the port development project&quot; (L. 1962, ch. 209, &sect; 2).  The quoted words should be so interpreted as to avoid doubt under the United States Constitution and the New York Constitution (art. I, &sect; 7) that this condemnation is &quot;for public use&quot;.  So construed, the quoted words allow only &quot;portions&quot; of structures or sites to be used for revenue purposes.  Accordingly, the statute is constitutional, and a temporary injunction against condemnation proceeding is reversed, and an order vesting title in the Authority's subsidiary corporation is reinstated.  The procedures of our condemnation statutes will afford a full hearing to any owner of property hereafter sought to be condemned who believes that his particular property is being unconstitutionally taken for revenue purposes primarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Business good will is ordinarily not compensable, and the statute is not unconstitutional for failing specifically to require such valuation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Port of New York Authority need not hold any hearing before determining to condemn any particular property in the statutorily designated area (L. 1962, ch. 209).  If an earlier statute (L. 1924, ch. 623, &sect; 1) required such a hearing, such statute was conditioned, as usual, on New Jersey's concurrence which was consistently denied by that State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Port of New York Authority's subsidiary corporation, Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, has clearly been given power of condemnation, even though the statute also says that such subsidiary shall not contract indebtedness (L. 1962, ch. 209, &sect;&sect; 12, 14, 16).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Legislature's determination that the two parts of the projected development -- the Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad system and the World Trade Center -- are inseparable and should &quot;proceed as rapidly as may be practicable&quot; (L. 1962, ch. 209) is not violated by the circumstance that the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation has begun by condemning property required for the railroad project.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents, 10 railroad companies brought an action against appellants, the Attorney General for the State of New York and the Public Service Commission, for a declaratory judgment and for a permanent injunction. Four unions intervened. Appellants challenged the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), affirming an order denying their motion for a change of venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The railroads sought a declaratory judgment that N.Y. R.R. Law &sect;&sect; 54-a, 54-b, and 54-c were unconstitutional, and the railroads sought an injunction to restrain further enforcement of those statutes. Appellants sought a change of venue to Albany County. The appellate division certified the question whether its affirmance was appropriate. The State asserted that the railroads had no right to sue in any county except Albany and primarily relied upon N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 879. Appellants asserted that a trial where none of the railroads had a principal office was not proper and that N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 1287 provided for proceedings against the commission to be in Albany. The court affirmed the judgment. Because two of the railroads operated lines through Westchester County, they were considered as a residents in that county for venue purposes. Because N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 879 applied to the granting of temporary injunctions only and not to final injunctions incidental to other relief, it did not require the case to be tried in Albany. The main thrust of the action was to test the constitutionality of the statutes, and the temporary injunctive relief sought was only incidental.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Noting that it answered the question certified to it in the affirmative, the court affirmed the judgment of the appellate division of the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trial -- venue -- injunction -- section 879 of Civil Practice Act, which provides that injunction restraining performance of statutory duty or preventing execution of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> shall not be granted except by Supreme Court in department in which officer or board restrained is located, or duty required to be performed, applies to temporary injunction only and is not applicable to the present action where final injunction is sought as incidental to other relief -- railroad companies operating lines in Westchester County are considered residents of that county for venue purposes (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 182).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1.  Section 182 of the Civil Practice Act requires that a Supreme Court action be tried &quot;in the county in which one of the parties resided at the commencement thereof&quot;.  Two of plaintiff railroad companies operated their lines through Westchester County and, for venue purposes, are considered residents in that county and, accordingly, under that statute, Westchester County was the proper venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 879 of the Civil Practice Act provides that: &quot;Where a duty is imposed by statute upon a state officer or board of state officers, an injunction order to restrain him or them, or a person employed by him or them, from the performance of that duty, or to prevent the execution of the statute, shall not be granted except by the supreme court at a term thereof sitting in the department in which the officer or board is located, or the duty is required to be performed; and upon notice of the application therefor to the officer, board or other person to be restrained.&quot; The present action was brought by 10 railroads for judgment declaring that sections 54-a, 54-b and 54-c of the Railroad Law are unconstitutional and for a permanent injunction restraining further enforcement of any of the three statutes.  Section 879 refers to temporary injunctions only and is not applicable to the present action. It does not apply to final injunctions incidental to other relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 1287 of the Civil Practice Act is a part of article 78 of the Civil Practice Act and does not refer to actions but to statutory proceedings in the nature of certiorari, mandamus and prohibition.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The union represented longshoremen registered and licensed by the commission. The Waterfront Commission Act (WCA) &sect;&sect; 8, 8-a, was amended to expand a prohibition on the union from employing persons convicted of felonies or other specified offenses. The union contended that the National Labor Relations Act and the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 preempted the WCA. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the amendment only expanded the provision, previously found constitutional, to include employees and crimes of moral turpitude and that state laws regulating the responsibility of union officials were exempted from the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. The court also concluded that barring convicted felons from the union was a reasonable means for eliminating corruption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a prior action it was determined that the subject matter of section 8 of the Waterfront Commission Act had not been pre-empted by Federal legislation and that it did not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Thereafter, the Waterfront Commission, having concluded that the provisions of the statute were being circumvented, said section 8 was amended.  The amending legislation is not invalid. It did no more than effect such changes as were deemed necessary to achieve the original objectives of the statute.  Congress did not intend to pre-empt the State regulation contained in section 8 either in its original or amended form and the statute in its amended form does not offend against due process. </SPAN></P>

The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed, and the individual appealed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the causes of action for breach of warranty ran from the date of sale. The court held that, where the nature and origin of the asserted liability was a negligent act, the statute of limitations could not be avoided through an allegation that the corporation had a continuing duty to warn of possible damaging consequences and that any duty to recall the product from the market had no bearing on the rights of those to whom it was administered years previously. The court refused to depart from the rule that the individual's injury occurred when the harmful substance was introduced into his body. The court held that the simple assertion that the accrual rule for negligence claims was unjust did not justify abandonment of prior holdings and that changes in limitations were the legislature's responsibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant chiropractic association sought to overturn the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment of a supreme court and held that respondent commissioner of health had issued proper regulations governing the use of x-rays pursuant to the authority granted to the commissioner under N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 225(4)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioner of health promulgated N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 10, &sect; 16.19, which prohibited the application of radiation to human beings unless the application was done under the supervision of one licensed to practice medicine, dentistry, podiatry, or osteopathy. The regulation had the effect of limiting the use of x-rays by chiropractors because they were not licensed to practice medicine. The lower court upheld the regulation, and the court affirmed. The court held that there was substantial evidence that x-rays were harmful. Once the record reflected at least a divergence of scientific opinion, the court was required to defer to the commissioner of health because the regulation was within the police power of the state. The court also held that, under N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 225(4)(a), the delegation of the authority to the commissioner to establish sanitary regulations was proper because flexibility was needed in regulating complex matters in the area of public health.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment that the regulation of the application of radiation to human beings by the commissioner of health was a valid exercise of the police power of the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Physicians and surgeons -- chiropractors -- X rays -- regulation 19 of chapter XVI of New York State Sanitary Code, which prohibits application of radiation to human being by anyone not licensed or otherwise authorized to practice medicine, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy, but does not prohibit use of radiation by technician, nurse or other person if such use is directed or ordered by person so licensed or authorized to practice for use in his field, was adopted by Public Health Council under valid delegation of legislative power and is not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Regulation 19 of chapter XVI of the New York State Sanitary Code prohibits the application of radiation to a human being by anyone not licensed or otherwise authorized to practice medicine, dentistry, podiatry or osteopathy but does not prohibit the use of radiation by a technician, nurse or other person if such use is directed or ordered by a person so licensed or authorized to practice for use in his field.  This regulation was adopted by the Public Health Council under a valid delegation of legislative power and is not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 225 of the Public Health Law (subds. 3, 4, par. [a]) authorizes the Public Health Council, with the approval of the Commissioner of Health, to establish the Sanitary Code which may &quot;deal with any matters affecting the security of life or health or the preservation and improvement of public health in the state of New York&quot;.  Although standards or guides must be prescribed where legislative power is delegated, it need be done in only so detailed a fashion as is reasonably practicable in the light of the complexities of the particular area to be regulated.  It lay within the technical competence of the Public Health Council to determine the principal sources of ionizing radiation, which has been found to have a deleterious, additive and cumulative effect upon human beings, particularly with respect to their reproductive life, and to adopt measures to limit exposure thereto where, in its judgment, the extent of such exposure exceeds the benefits derived therefrom.  In such situations the principle is well established that a general grant of power may be made to an expert board, leaving its implementation to the members thereof who are chosen from experts in the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It did not transcend the police power of the State for the Public Health Council to rule that the unfamiliarity of chiropractors with the effects of radiation and the danger of their ordering or applying too much of it through ignorance constituted a danger to the public health, especially in view of the wholesale use of X ray in their domain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Regulation 19 does not contain an absolute prohibition that no chiropractor shall ever be permitted to take X rays. Any qualified person may do so provided that he takes them only by the direction, for use in his field, of one licensed or authorized by law to diagnose and treat human ailments. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The electricians initiated an action against the city to recover excess money paid to the city for excessive, unconstitutional license fees. The trial court granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of the electricians and granted in part and denied in part a motion for an order striking the city's denials and defenses. The appellate court affirmed the order of the trial court, and the city sought review. The court held that payments of illegal taxes were allowed to be recovered when they had been made under protest. The court further held that protest was not required in order to recover money paid pursuant to an illegal statute or ordinance. The court held that, in view of the compulsory nature of the required payments, formal protest by the electricians was not required to recover such payments. The court held that the excessive license fees imposed on the electricians as a condition of their rights to pursue their occupation was an invasion of present liberty of person. The court affirmed judgments of the lower courts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The license fees for electricians which ranged from $ 100 to $ 250 during the years 1954 through 1959 were held to be so excessive as to be unconstitutional ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Adlerstein </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> City of New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 6 N Y 2d 740). In the present action several hundred electricians were properly permitted to recover the excess over $ 25 apiece (the correct fee amount) paid to the City of New York during the years 1954 through 1959.  These license payments were not made under protest, but it was properly determined that the payments were made under duress as matter of law and that consequently protest was not required.  They were involuntary since failure to make them would have required plaintiffs to discontinue the conduct of their business.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner employees association appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed an order of the supreme court that dismissed the association's petition. The supreme court found that Rochester, N.Y., Ord. &sect; 3-24 was entirely valid and that the association had shown no grounds for relief against respondents, mayor and others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 3-24 authorized the city manager to recognize city employees' unions or employees associations, to negotiate with the recognized bargaining agents, and to execute collective bargaining agreements with the bargaining agents. The employes association argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional for a lack of standards and that the city manager's alleged favoritism to a particular union was discriminatory and against public policy. The supreme court, which the lower appellate court affirmed, dismissed the association's petition. On appeal, the court reversed the order. The court found that the ordinance was not invalid because a requirement of fairness and reasonableness was implied. However, the city manager failed to reveal by what process and steps he decided on the bargaining unit. Thus the court remanded the case to the supreme court to determine whether the city manager's procedures were fair and reasonable and whether they were taken with due regard to the claims of the association and the rights of the city employees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The City of Rochester adopted an ordinance authorizing the City Manager to recognize a duly organized union or employee organization as the bargaining agent for an appropriate unit of city employees upon submission to him of satisfactory proof that said union or organization is representative of the unit.  The ordinance is not invalid for lack of prescribed standards.  Although it contains no instructions as to how to determine &quot;an appropriate unit&quot; or how to decide which organization is the appropriate &quot;bargaining agent&quot; for that unit, a requirement of fairness and reasonableness is to be implied.  Such determinations by the City Manager are to be made after reasonable inquiry into the facts, including the right of interested organizations to be heard.  The City Manager must have a measure of discretion in determining the procedures to be followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The petition asked for relief in the nature of mandamus. However, the City Manager, by signing a collective bargaining agreement with the AFL-CIO union, made a final determination of a kind reviewable by proceedings in the nature of certiorari.  The court may now treat the proceeding as one for certiorari review.  Accordingly, the matter is sent back to Special Term for a trial to determine by what process and steps the City Manager decided on the unit and recognized the bargaining agent, and whether those procedures were fair and reasonable and whether they were taken with due regard to the claims of petitioner and the rights of the city employees. </SPAN></P>

Code &sect; D26-3.1, in failing to file a registration statement with respect to &quot;owning&quot; a multiple dwelling, and dismissing the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction was reversed and complaint dismissed because &sect; D26-3.1 imposed a liability solely upon &quot;the true owner.&quot; The court reversed the order and remitted the case to the appellate term. The court found that if the words in &sect; D26-2.2 were to have their reasonable and natural sense, the term &quot;owner,&quot; &quot;whenever used&quot; in the N.Y. Mult. Dwell. Code, included an &quot;agent, or any other person in control of a multiple dwelling.&quot; It followed that the defendant, as the one indisputably in control of the premises, was properly convicted. Defendant contended that &sect; D26-2.2(15) rendered only the &quot;true owner&quot; responsible for filing a registration statement. The court held that when &sect; D26-3.1 was read in the light of &sect; D26-2.2(15), it became manifest that all who were included within the term &quot;owner&quot; shared a responsibility for complying with the filing provision and that, if the owner failed to file the statement, the agent or other person in control of the premises was liable. Similarly, N.Y. Mult. Dwell. Law &sect; 325 also required the owner &quot;and&quot; an agent or other person in control to file an equivalent of the registration statement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) affirmed a trial court ruling and granted appellee state declaratory judgment in an action brought by appellant railroad in which the railroad claimed it had contractual rights to certain benefits under state legislation passed to benefit railroads and later amended. The railroad appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Out of great concern for the welfare and viability of railroads, the state legislature passed legislation allowing railroads to restructure as redevelopment corporations and, thereby, enjoy certain tax and other benefits. Later, that legislation was amended so that the benefits once conferred were not altogether present. The railroad challenged the amendment and claimed that when the initial legislation was passed it was granted a contractual right to certain benefits thereunder, benefits which were later wrongfully withheld through legislative amendment. The trial court and the appellate division found no contractual rights existed and dismissed the railroad's claim accordingly. On appeal, the court affirmed and found the legislation at issue clearly conferred no contractual rights on any party. The court held that it was never to be assumed that the state had fettered its power in the future, except upon clear and irresistible evidence that the engagement was in the nature of a private contract, as distinguished from a mere act of general legislation. This case was one of only general legislation under which the railroad obtained no contractual right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the ruling of the appellate division and held that the legislation at issue was general legislation that conferred no contractual rights on the railroad.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- impairment of obligation of contract -- railroads -- original statutory grant of power to railroad which qualified as railroad redevelopment corporation to increase fares and charges without advance approval by Public Service Commission did not constitute contract between State and railroad -- subsequent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> requiring advance approval by Public Service Commission did not impair obligation of any contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Article 7 of the Railroad Law, enacted in 1951 (L. 1951, ch. 359), provided for the formation of railroad redevelopment corporations.  Section 307 of a new article 7 adopted in 1954 provided that, should the revenues of a railroad which qualified as a railroad redevelopment corporation under the revised article be insufficient, the company would be entitled to raise its fares subject to subsequent review by the Public Service Commission to determine whether the new fares were needed to provide the required revenues.  The Long Island Rail Road Company qualified as such a redevelopment corporation and became one in August, 1954.  A 1958 amendment to section 307 of the Railroad Law (L. 1958, ch. 386) requires that prior application must be made to the Public Service Commission for approval of rates.  The original grant of power to increase fares and charges without advance approval by the Public Service Commission did not constitute a contract between the State and the Long Island Rail Road and the Pennsylvania Railroad which was its sole stockholder and principal creditor.  Consequently, the statute does not impair the obligation of any contract in violation of the Federal or State Constitutions (U. S. Const., art. I, &sect; 10; N. Y. Const., art I, &sect; 15).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Before a law may be deemed to amount to a contract between the State and a third party, the statutory language must be found to be susceptible of no other reasonable interpretation than that a contract was intended.  There is nothing in the 1954 legislation to support the idea of a contract with the Long Island Rail Road or any other particular railroad. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, two landlords and a tenant, challenged orders of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which dismissed their constitutional challenge to &sect; 4 of the Emergency Housing Rent Control Law, as amended by 1962 N.Y. Laws ch. 21, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The constitutional challenge to the rent control statute was brought on grounds of due process and equal protection. The court affirmed the judgments that found the statute constitutional. The court found no violation of due process because landlords were allowed a reasonable rent and because rent control was a reasonable exercise of the police power. The court held that the use of prior year equalization rates was a classification having a reasonable basis because the use of the most recent equalization rates was likely to result in a wave of rent increases; hence, the statute did not offend against the equal protection clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- constitutional law -- Emergency Housing Rent Control Law, as amended in 1962 (&sect; 4, subd. [a], as amd. by L. 1962, ch. 21, &sect; 4), revoked 1961 law which had employed equalization rates for &quot;most recent year&quot; and restored formula which had been in use from 1957 to 1961, providing that value of rent-controlled residential property, on which landlord is entitled to 6% return, should be fixed by applying 1954 equalization rates to current assessed valuation of such property -- no denial of due process or equal protection of laws -- Legislature adopted reasonable means of protecting public from abnormal rent increases in time of rental housing shortage -- no constitutional right to return of 6% even on market value -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> not discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 4 (subd. [a]) of the Emergency Housing Rent Control Law, as amended in 1962 (L. 1962, ch. 21, &sect; 4), provides that the value of rent-controlled residential property, on which the landlord is entitled to a 6% return, is to be fixed by applying 1954 equalization rates to the current assessed valuation of such property.  It revokes the 1961 amendment which had employed equalization rates for &quot;the most recent year&quot; (L. 1961, ch. 337) and restores the formula which had been in use from 1957 to June 30, 1961 (L. 1957, ch. 755; L. 1959, ch. 695).  The 1961 rates reflected a sharp drop from those of 1954 and it became obvious that their impact would have a drastic or undesirable effect upon the maximum rents of a substantial number of controlled tenants. The Legislature was faced with the immediate danger of &quot;serious threats to the public health, safety and general welfare&quot; which would result from the &quot;disruptive practices and abnormal conditions&quot; produced by the mass rent increases which would follow if the 1961 equalization rates were applied to current assessments.  The protection of the public against such increases in a time of a rental housing shortage being a valid legislative purpose, the Legislature adopted a reasonable means of effectuating that purpose by restoring the use of the 1954 rates.  The legislation does not effect a denial of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is no constitutional right to a return to the landlords of 6% even on market value. Even assuming that the landlords are precluded from receiving a 6% return on market value by the use of 1954 equalization rates, the statute may not be invalidated on the ground that it is confiscatory, since there is no suggestion that the return which they are allowed is so low as to be unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The 1962 amendment is not discriminatory on its face and did not deprive appellants of equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The fact that the statutory scheme results in inequality as between landlords and tenants in different assessing units, since the ratio between 1954 and 1961 equalization rates is not uniform throughout the State, does not result in any violation of the equal protection of the laws.  The fact that, in carrying out the scheme devised by the Legislature, a particular landlord or tenant may suffer does not render the method selected discriminatory or render the statute unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action against the City Rent and Rehabilitation Administration, the owners of rent-controlled residential properties (owners) challenged the constitutionality of portions of the City Rent and Rehabilitation law, which related to the procedure for obtaining maximum rent adjustments under the fair net provision. The trial court dismissed the complaint. The owners appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the city council acted within its power by imposing more stringent police power restrictions. According to the court, there had been a gradual relaxation of the rent control measures, and it was not until the more favorable provisions were found to have been abused that new restrictions were adopted to combat that evil. The court rejected the owners' claim that the combination of the two-year hiatus between applications and the 15 percent maximum increase during any two-year period was unconstitutional because it left the landlord in a position where he was earning less than the statutory &quot;6 and 2&quot; return until his applications were favorably acted upon.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- enactment in New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Law (Local Laws, 1962, No. 20 of City of New York) of two-year provisions relating to pre-filing, repeated applications and 15% maximum increase, in connection with &quot;hardship&quot; applications for nonservice connected rent increases, was not unjustified and provisions were not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> because allegedly harsher than needed, made applicable to pending proceedings, or allegedly operating to deprive landlords of reasonable, as opposed to statutory, return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Law (Local Laws, 1962, No. 20 of City of New York) provided that a &quot;hardship&quot; application for a nonservice connected rent increase (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; Y41-5.0, subd. g, par. [1], subpar. [a]) may not be filed less than two years after the filing date of the last prior application which resulted in an increase (Administrative Code, &sect; Y41-5.0, subd. g, par. [1], subpar. [a], cl. [2], subcl. [i]) or less than two years after the last sale of the property where the application was based on a sale price higher than the assessed valuation (&sect; Y41-5.0, subd. g, par. [1], subpar. [a], cl. [2], subcl. [ii]); that the total adjustments ordered may not exceed 15% in any two-year period (&sect; Y41-5.0, subd. g, par. [2]), and that the law should apply to pending administrative proceedings (&sect; Y41-14.0, subds. a, b, par. [1]).  Enactment of such provisions, supported by the presumption of constitutionality, was not unjustified inasmuch as the reports of various administrative and legislative bodies, numerous documents and the testimony at a public hearing as to the inflationary effect of &quot;hardship&quot; sales and applications, if unabated, gave the City Council the right to a fear of future difficulties which was sufficient to justify the exercise of police power.  Accordingly, the complaints of landlords, whose applications for rent increases were adversely affected by the provisions of the city law, were properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Allegations that the statutory provisions were harsher than needed were inappropriate on a direct appeal which brings up constitutional questions only (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 588, subd. 4).  In any event, where the challenged legislation is reasonably related to an actual, manifest evil, the courts may not dictate the choice of remedy, and questions of wisdom, need or appropriateness are for the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The provisions of the City Rent and Rehabilitation Law were not invalid because they were inconsistent with the former State law.  The enabling legislation expressly gave the city the right to adopt local laws, rules or regulations appropriate to meet the emergency housing situation despite such inconsistency (L. 1962, ch. 21, &sect; 1, subd. 5).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Landlords, although mandated by the Constitution to be allowed to earn a reasonable return, do not have and never have had any constitutionally guaranteed right to the statutory 6% return on the value of the property and 2% depreciation.  Accordingly, the combination of the two-year hiatus between applications and the 15% maximum increase in any two-year period was not unconstitutional because a landlord may be earning less than the return provided by statute until his applications are approved.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A manager of a bookstore and the cashier at another bookstore were arrested after telling a detective the price of two books. The detective asked the owner of the second store if he knew the books were pornographic. The owner was arrested after responding that he had seen worse than those books. Defendants, the manager and owner, were convicted of selling or possessing with the intent to sell any obscene book. The appellate court affirmed. Defendants appealed. The court affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant board members sought review of the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) that dismissed their complaint against respondent mayor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Board members sought review of the dismissal of the complaint. The board members were relieved of their duties prior to the expiration of their term. The board members contended the new law violated the home rule provisions of the state constitution. The court held that the legislature could have modified a term in the public interest even though the effect might have been to curtail an incumbent's unexpired term. The board members contended that the statute was a bill of attainder. The court held that the statute did not have any of the objectionable attributes of a bill of attainder. The court determined that the home rule provision did not apply to nonlocal or newly created offices. The court held that the board of education was not a department of the city government, but was an independent corporate body. The board members argued that the method of appointment was an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. The court did not find this argument persuasive in light of contrary authority. The court held that there was no constitutional bar to the legislative designation of a nominating panel made up of people representing a knowledgeable cross section of city interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the judgment without costs. The court ordered the complaint reinstated, declared a portion of a statute governing a city's board of education unconstitutional, and declared the mayor's appointments valid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Board of Education -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (L. 1961, ch. 971) providing for appointment of members of Board of Education of City of New York from list of nominees submitted by heads of three universities and presidents of eight educational, civic, business, labor and professional organizations, not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pursuant to chapter 971 of the Laws of 1961, the terms of those then comprising the Board of Education of the City of New York were to come to an end on September 20, 1961, and appointments of new members of the board, as well as of their successors, were to be made by the Mayor of the City of New York from a list of nominees to be submitted to him by a board consisting of the heads of three universities located in New York City and the presidents of eight other organizations representing educational, civic, business, labor and professional groups interested in city affairs including education.  In an action by former members of the board for judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional, the courts below correctly decided that it was valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute does not violate the home rule provisions of the State Constitution (art. IX, &sect; 9) concerning the election and appointment of &quot;city officers&quot;.  Members of New York City's Board of Education are not &quot;city officers&quot; within the meaning of those provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since education is a State and not a local function, and members of the Board of Education are State and not local officers, such officers may be &quot;elected by the people or appointed, as the legislature may direct.&quot; (N. Y. Const., art. IX, &sect; 9.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There is no constitutional inhibition against the shortening of the term of an existing statutory office by legislation aimed at the office rather than at its incumbent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The statute is not a bill of attainder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The method of appointment provided by the statute is not an unlawful delegation of legislative authority in violation of section 1 of article III of the State Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. It was error to dismiss the complaint in an action for a declaratory judgment merely because plaintiffs were not entitled to a declaration of their rights as they claim to be.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff bus company sought to permanently restrain defendant city from acquiring the company's omnibus properties and franchises and to declare invalid the statute under which the city purported to act. The trial court denied the company's motion for temporary injunction. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) reversed the order. The city sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue was whether N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 20 (1962), which authorized a municipality to condemn private property for a public use without providing for personal notice to the owner in advance of the condemnation, violated the Due Process Clause. The company urged that the property was taken to reconvey their property to another corporation to perform the same services and, therefore, was for a private use. On appeal, the court held that the exercise of eminent domain in a summary fashion was did not violate due process. The power of eminent domain could be exercised by simply entering into possession without either prior notice or court order. So long as a condemnee was given an adequate opportunity to be heard regarding compensation, there was no need for any other notice of an intended appropriation. Although &sect; 20 did not require prior notice, the company knew of the city's intent to take the company's bus lines. The taking of the property of a public service corporation in order to provide the same service under governmental auspices was a public use. The company would have an opportunity to prove its allegations of private use, conspiracy, and bad faith at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order from the appellate court, which reversed the trial court's order denying the company's motion for a temporary injunction to restrain the city from acquiring the company's properties. The court reinstated the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent domain -- notice of condemnation -- City of New York not required to give notice of condemnation in acquiring plaintiffs' omnibus properties and franchises -- taking was for public use -- temporary injunction denied but, since complaint not dismissed, opportunity is provided to prove that purpose was to reconvey plaintiffs' property to another corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action permanently to restrain the City of New York from acquiring plaintiffs' omnibus properties and franchises and for judgment declaring invalid and void on constitutional grounds the statute under which the city purported to act, a temporary injunction should not have been granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute under which the city has acted (General City Law, &sect; 20, as amd. by L. 1962, ch. 161, eff. March 19, 1962) is not unconstitutional for failure to provide for notice to the owners of the property condemned prior to the actual taking of possession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Legislature has the power to enact a law authorizing a municipality to condemn private property for a public use without providing for personal notice to the owner or owners in advance of the condemnation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. So long as a condemnee is given an adequate opportunity to be heard on the subjects of compensation and public use, there need not be any other notice of an intended appropriation. The statute contains provisions completely adequate in this respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The taking over by government of the property of a public service corporation for the purpose of providing the same service under governmental, as opposed to private, auspices is a public use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. There is no proof in the record concerning plaintiffs' allegation that the true purpose of the condemnation is to reconvey their property to another corporation to perform the very services which they have heretofore been providing.  Since the complaint is not being dismissed, plaintiffs are not being deprived of any opportunity to prove their allegations in this action if they so choose.  </SPAN></P>

R. Civ. Prac. 106(4) and of an order of the Supreme Court at Special Kings County (New York), which dismissed a proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners sought a declaration of unconstitutionality of an amendment, 1962 N.Y.

Laws ch. 274, that prohibited any increase in rents, unless a tenant consented, for a period of two and one-half months from the effective date of the amendment. At the end of that period, New York City was to take over rent control administration within its boundaries. The trial courts held that 1962 N.Y. Laws ch. 21, &sect; 6 was not violative of any constitutional rights of the owners, and the owners took direct appeals to the court. In affirming the decisions, the court held that the freeze in the rent increases for the relatively short period pending transfer of control to the city was reasonably incidental to such a change over and was constitutional. Further, the owners had no &quot;vested&quot; rights to increase orders or to continuation of the rules or formulae on which their applications had been based. The legislature concluded that one necessary or desirable condition of the concededly valid State-to-city rent regulatory power transfer was that there be a breathing spell during which no increase orders should be entered.</SPAN></P>

Respondent city sought dismissal of the complaint and for summary judgment, and the supreme court held that the home owners were not entitled to relief. On appeal, the appellate division modified the judgment by directing judgment for the city rather than merely dismissal of the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the complaint did not allege any failure to carry out any of the statutory procedures, but rather the real basis of the complaint was that there was in the area no &quot;tangible physical blight&quot; as to constitute the area of slum. The court found, as did the courts below, that an area did not have to be a &quot;slum&quot; to make its redevelopment a public use, nor was public use negated by a plan to turn a predominantly vacant, poorly developed and organized area into a site for new industrial buildings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent school board sought review of a judgment from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which reversed an order of the supreme court that estopped the teacher from demanding restoration of her tenure rights and directed the school board to restore the teacher's position on the payroll with full tenure rights and with back pay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents of students in the teacher's class presented informal complaints against the teacher, who had tenure. The president of the school district informed the teacher of the complaints and told her that she was not to teach any more. Another teacher was installed in the teacher's classroom. The school board then authorized an agreement in which it agreed to pay the teacher for the remainder of the year and to provide a good letter of recommendation. The principal wrote a letter that provided the dates and grades taught by the teacher but it did not provide a recommendation. The teacher filed a petition for reinstatement with back pay, which was denied by the supreme court. The appellate division reversed the supreme court's decision upon finding that the agreement was invalid because it was contrary to the tenure statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3013, and because it violated the constitutional ban against gifts of public moneys. N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The school board claimed on appeal that the agreement was valid. The court rejected the school board's claim. The court ruled that the agreement was invalid and that the school board failed to comply with the agreement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the appellate division's order that the teacher be reinstated to her teaching position with restoration of tenure rights and with back pay.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- teachers -- tenure -- agreement whereby</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> local school board attempted to discharge tenured teacher without charges or hearing by paying her year's salary for not teaching is in violation both of tenure law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Education Law, &sect; 3013</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) and of constitutional prohibition against gifts of public moneys (N. Y. Const., art. VIII, &sect; 1) -- board violated agreement -- teacher not estopped and not required to return salary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In October, 1957, at a time when petitioner had tenure and was eligible for retirement and the local school board had renewed her contract for the school year 1956-1957, petitioner was told that the school board would pay her salary until the end of the term if she would resign and that she was relieved from duty. When she went to her classroom she found another teacher there.  The president of the school board told petitioner that she was entitled to a hearing and she stated that she wished to have one.  At a meeting thereafter conducted, at which petitioner was not present but at which a lawyer who had not been retained as her attorney spoke in her behalf, the school board authorized an arrangement for the payment to petitioner of her salary to the end of the year and stated that the board would give her &quot;a good letter of recommendation&quot;.  Petitioner never resigned and charges have never been filed against her or tried.  It is a violation of tenure rights (Education Law, &sect; 3013) to remove, without charges and hearing, a teacher who has tenure. To hold that, for a consideration, petitioner waived her right to a hearing would be contrary to the public policy of this State expressed in the tenure statutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Moreover, an agreement under which public money would be paid without services rendered on condition that charges be withheld and the teacher resign is an unconstitutional gift of public money (N. Y. Const., art. VIII, &sect; 1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The agreement was also invalid because the board never, in fact, complied with it.  It did not give petitioner a letter of recommendation but merely an official statement as to the duration of her teaching career and the fact that she had the required qualifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioner is not estopped from questioning the validity of the contract because she accepted its benefits.  She got no benefits.  Furthermore, public policy renders it doubtful whether estoppel can be invoked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. It is not necessary for petitioner to return the salary paid to her before she obtains relief.  After she was told by the principal to stop teaching, she was under no obligation to present herself every morning for work since she had a valid permanent contract of employment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) reversed an order that sustained a writ of habeas corpus and that discharged defendant from prison. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the appellate division erred in reversing the lower court's order that granted the writ of habeas corpus. The court agreed, reversed the order of the appellate division, and reinstated the order of the special term that granted defendant a writ of habeas corpus and released him from prison. The court found that the information charging defendant with various housing code violations, and which also served as the basis for a warrant of arrest, was unsworn. The court found that where a defendant was convicted of a misdemeanor, rather than an offense of less than the grade of misdemeanor, an unsworn information was jurisdictionally defective and could not support a conviction. Accordingly, the court held that the proceedings were jurisdictionally defective and that the special term properly sustained the writ.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- unsworn information -- unsworn information insufficient whether crime charged is misdemeanor or &quot;offense&quot; -- court without jurisdiction to try defendant on charges of violations of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Multiple Dwelling Law ( &sect;&sect; 78</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">80</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) and Multiple Dwelling Code of City of New York (&sect;&sect; D26-3.1, D26-3.2) on unsworn information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York City Magistrates' Court was without jurisdiction to try appellant on the basis of an unsworn information charging him with violations of sections 78 and 80 of the Multiple Dwelling Law and sections D26-3.1 and D26-3.2 of the Multiple Dwelling Code of the City of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Where a defendant is charged with a misdemeanor, as distinguished from an offense of less than the grade of misdemeanor, an unsworn information is jurisdictionally defective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. One offense of which appellant was convicted -- violation of section 80 of the Multiple Dwelling Law -- must be treated procedurally as a misdemeanor ( Multiple Dwelling Law, &sect; 304, subd. 1-a).  The legislative history of that statute makes it clear that the Legislature, in downgrading the violation of certain sections of the Multiple Dwelling Law from misdemeanors to offenses, intended to preserve to defendant all his prior procedural rights.  Since the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, and an unsworn information does not confer jurisdiction upon a court to try a misdemeanor, it follows that the court had no jurisdiction to try appellant on the basis of the unverified information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Where, as here, the punishment for an &quot;offense&quot; could be a year's imprisonment in a State prison and a substantial fine, an &quot;offense&quot; cannot be said to be of such minor consequence that an unsworn information is sufficient.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff riparian owner challenged the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the order of the lower court granting the motion of defendant, the City of New York (city), for judgment on the pleadings, dismissed the complaint seeking to enjoin the city from diverting an upstream river, and denied the riparian owner's cross motion for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Seven years after the city commenced diversion of an upstream river pursuant to the Water Supply Act (Act), the riparian owner brought an action against the city to prevent it from diverting the river. The city filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the action was time-barred by her failure to file a claim within three years as required by New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; K41-18.0. The lower court granted the motion, dismissed the complaint, and denied the riparian owner's cross motion, and the appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the notice requirements of New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; K41-8.0 satisfied due process because it called for frequent publication in public newspapers and in two newspapers published in each county where the affected real estate was located. The Act also provided for the posting of handbills for a period of time in conspicuous places near the aqueduct or the affected real estate. The court found that the city complied with the requirements of the Act. The court also found that the effect of the diversion was apparent to the riparian owner long before the three-year limitation expired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the city in an action brought by the riparian owner seeking to prevent the city from diverting a river upstream from her property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The notice provisions of the Water Supply Act (Administrative Code of City of New York, ch. 41, tit. K) do not contravene the requirements of due process.  Not only does the statute call for publication once a week for six weeks in two newspapers published in New York City and in two papers published in each county in which the real estate affected is located, but it also provides for the posting of handbills, for a period of six weeks, &quot;in at least twenty conspicuous places on the line of the aqueduct or in the vicinity of the real estate so to be taken or affected&quot; (&sect; K41-8.0).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Where the City of New York in June, 1952 became invested with the right to divert a portion of the Neversink River in Orange County, and the work on the actual diversion started in June of 1953, the complaint in an action commenced seven years thereafter to enjoin the city from diverting the river upstream from plaintiff's property was properly dismissed on the ground that the action was barred by plaintiff's failure to file a claim within the time limited, as required by the Water Supply Act (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; K41-18.0).  Moreover, the challenged diversion of the river was apparent long before the expiration of such period.  </SPAN></P>

The trustees of the fund opposed the application on grounds that N.Y. Insurance Law &sect; 16 asserted by the superintendent as authority for such a liquidation was, as applied, inconsistent with and repugnant to &sect; 3029(c)(5) of the Federal Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 186 (c)(5). The trial court granted the petition and the trustees appealed. The court affirmed, holding that clearly, the intent of Congress was not to pre-empt the field, but to leave in the state a large measure of regulatory power over these insurance funds. The state insurance department was doing nothing to prevent the &quot;carrying out&quot; of the welfare fund agreement but was exercising a power as to liquidation, a subject which no federal act dealt with.</SPAN></P>

He also contended that the statute conferring jurisdiction over gambling offenses on the magistrates' court was unconstitutional.

The town claimed that the corporation never acquired any rights by virtue of their prior use, since such use was at all times in violation of two prior zoning ordinances enacted in 1924 and 1932. The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure of the ordinances to be personally served on the corporation or their predecessors in title as the act expressly required. The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court then reversed the appellate court's order and found that the ordinances cited by the town did not apply due to procedural defects in their enactment. The court further found that the evidence was clear that the corporation's activities constituted a prior nonconforming use which it was entitled to continue. There was no ground upon which the town would be entitled to the injunction which it sought, and the complaint was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- prior nonconforming use -- defendants entitled to continue prior nonconforming uses after enactment of zoning ordinance -- prior use was not in violation of prior zoning ordinance since such prior ordinance did not take effect because it was not personally served upon defendants or predecessors in title (Town Law, &sect; 142-a; L. 1922, ch. 322).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The complaint in an action by a town to enjoin defendants from using two parcels of land for purposes allegedly not permitted uses under the town's present zoning ordinance is dismissed.  At the time the zoning ordinance took effect, defendant corporation was operating a restaurant and bar and a swimming pool on parcels situated in a one-family residence district.  Such uses are prohibited uses in such a district.  Since they were prior nonconforming uses, defendants are entitled to the continued use of the property contrary to the provisions of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The prior use was not in violation of a prior zoning ordinance of 1924.  Section 142-a of the Town Law (L. 1919, ch. 218) provided that: &quot;Ordinances which the town board may adopt shall be published before they shall go into effect in a newspaper published in the town, if any, and also in such other newspaper or newspapers as may be designated by the town board, and posted in at least three public places in the town.  Such ordinances shall take effect ten days after the date of such publication, if any, and posting.&quot; Section 142-a was amended (L. 1922, ch. 322) by the addition of a new subdivision 18 which for the first time conferred upon town boards the power to enact zoning ordinances. That new subdivision provided that such a zoning ordinance &quot;shall take effect from the date of its service as against a person served personally with a copy thereof, certified by the town clerk under the corporate seal of the town, and showing the date of its passage and entry in the minutes.&quot; The 1924 zoning ordinance, enacted pursuant to the authority provided by said chapter 322 of the Laws of 1922, did not take effect because it was not personally served upon defendants or their predecessors in title as that statute expressly required.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was 13 years old when he withdrew his plea of not guilty, pleaded guilty to murder in the second degree, and was sentenced to 30 years to life. In the coram nobis petition, defendant prayed for the guilty plea and sentence to be vacated and requested a hearing, claiming that because of his youth and epileptic condition, his plea was not voluntary and he was therefore denied due process of law. The court reversed the trial court's denial of the petition without a hearing, holding that defendant's allegations stated a case for coram nobis relief. Defendant's guilty plea had been accepted despite medical evidence before the trial court that the killing had occurred while defendant was in the throes of an epileptic rage or furor attack. The court held that the taking of a guilty plea from defendant, a child, called for an extreme measure of caution and at least certainty of guilty and of the complete absence of any plausible defense. Because defendant appeared to have such a defense and insufficient consideration was given to it, the court remanded the action to the trial court for a hearing on the coram nobis petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant motel appealed from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment of the lower court in favor of plaintiff thruway authority (authority), regarding the constitutionality of N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 361-a, which restricted the erection of billboards and other advertising devices along the thruway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The motel argued that &sect; 361-a was invalid because it was not reasonably related to the public health, morals, or safety, and because it constituted a taking of property rights without compensation. The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate division. The court determined that there could be no doubt that the statute was reasonably related to a legitimate legislative purpose because it was aimed at rendering the thruway safe for the traveling public by providing maximum visibility and by preventing unreasonable distractions. The court concluded that police power was the least limitable of the powers of government and extended to all of the great public needs, and if the end desired was within the power of the state and the means used were reasonably suited to that end, it was no objection that the rights of private property were thereby curtailed. The court explained that because &sect; 361-a represented a constitutional exercise of the state's police power, the injunction was properly issued to require the motel to remove the advertising device that it was maintaining.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 361-a of the Public Authorities Law prohibits the erection of any billboard or other advertising device within a stated distance of the nearest edge of the New York State Thruway pavement unless a written permit is granted by the Thruway Authority and gives the Authority (subd. 3) the power to adopt regulations for the issuance of permits for advertising devices (a) &quot;To provide for maximum visibility&quot;; (b) &quot;To prevent unreasonable distraction&quot; of motor vehicle operators; (c) &quot;To prevent confusion with regard to traffic lights, signs or signals&quot; or other interference with the effectiveness of traffic regulations; (d) &quot;To preserve and enhance the natural scenic beauty or the aesthetic features of the thruway system&quot;, and (e) &quot;To promote maximum safety, comfort and well-being of the users of the thruway.&quot; Pursuant to that statute defendants were properly enjoined from continuing the use of a sign erected by them along the Thruway without having a permit.  The statute is not unconstitutional.  It was aimed at rendering the Thruway safe for the traveling public by providing for maximum visibility and by preventing unreasonable distractions and is reasonably related to a legitimate legislative purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It is not necessary to determine whether the preservation of &quot;the natural scenic beauty&quot; would of itself be a sufficient basis for the legislation.  This is only one of the objectives and standards which the Authority is directed to have in mind in adopting regulations for the issuance of permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendants are not being deprived of their property without due process of law. Although the sign existed at another location at a prior time, it was relocated and placed in its present position sometime after the effective date of the statute.  This constituted the erection of a new sign.  Moreover, it was the construction of the Thruway which created the element of value in the land abutting the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Even if, however, defendants possessed valid and subsisting property rights which the legislation abrogated, this would not provide a sufficient basis for declaring the statute unconstitutional. The statute represents a constitutional exercise of the State's police power. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A foreign corporation was in the business of providing a service for the placing of orders for liquor by United States residents traveling abroad and of arranging for the delivery of the liquor to their homes duty free. The attorney general served a subpoena duces tecum on the foreign corporation's president to testify and produce the foreign corporation's books and records. The foreign corporation brought a proceeding to vacate the subpoena duces tecum. It argued that (1) the subpoena was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite and (2) it was not subject to service of process because it was a foreign corporation not doing business in the state.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The petitioner, a Panamanian corporation with its principal place of business in Haiti, is in the business of providing a service for the placing of orders for liquor by residents of this country traveling abroad and of arranging for the delivery of the liquor to their homes duty free. The Attorney-General served a subpoena, pursuant to subdivision 12 of section 63 of the Executive Law, upon petitioner's president in New York City requiring petitioner to give testimony in an inquiry by the Attorney-General to determine whether an application should be made or an action instituted to enjoin petitioner &quot;from the commission of persistently fraudulent or illegal acts&quot; and directing the production of corporate books and records.  The subpoena is not defective for failing to show what matters are in fact under investigation or in what manner the requested documents are relevant and material to such investigation.  Upon this preliminary motion, the Attorney-General need only show that the records and books demanded bear a reasonable relation to the subject matter under investigation and to the public purpose to be achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The corporation is subject to the service of this process although it is a foreign corporation.  Where the purpose of the proceeding is to protect citizens of the State from potentially dangerous consequences, less evidence of the corporation's doing business in the State is required than might otherwise be required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The issuance of a subpoena is not rendered improper because it may produce the evidence required to establish that petitioner is doing business in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Even if petitioner's contacts with this State were less than necessary to justify the maintenance of a civil suit, petitioner would still be amenable to the subpoena served upon its president by the Attorney-General in connection with the investigation.  A foreign corporation's immunity from civil suit in New York on the ground that it is not here doing business does not give it immunity from investigation by the Attorney-General in an inquiry to determine whether it is violating the laws of this State.  </SPAN></P>

The state read the purpose of &sect; 30 as being the elimination of advertising along public highways. The state was previously unsuccessful in passing other laws to achieve the same purpose. The property owners brought an action against the state, which the appellate court dismissed on the state's motion. The court reversed. The court held that &sect; 30 was not designed or intended to authorize the condemnation of easements for the purpose of eliminating advertising under the &quot;other purposes&quot; clause because &sect; 30 referred to specific adjuncts such as drains, ditches, gravel pits, and stone quarries. In addition, other statutes regulated or prohibited advertising signs on other roads and there were four abortive attempts to obtain similar legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landlord sought review of a judgment from the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which dismissed an action against appellees, state housing rent commission and others, that challenged the validity and constitutionality of the N.Y. Emergency Housing Rent Control Law &sect; 4(4)(a)(1)(v).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landlord bought an apartment house. Two months later, the legislature enacted the N.Y. Emergency Housing Rent Control Law &sect; 4(4)(a)(1)(v), which provided that no application for a maximum rent increase could be made until six months after the date of purchase of a rental property, and that any increase could not be implemented prior to one year from the date of purchase. In affirming the judgment, the court first cemented the validity of the statute. The court explained that it was presumed that the legislature acted based on facts found to warrant the action. Besides this presumption the court noted a slew of facts, generated by two commissions, relating to the crisis in the rental housing situation, which girded the legislative fiat. Furthermore, the court explained that a well-founded fear of future trouble could justify present legislation. The court similarly was not disposed to favor the landlord's claim that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment which dismissed the landlord's challenge to an emergency rent control act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- fixing rent on sale price -- provisions of Emergency Housing Rent Control Law (L. 1961, ch. 337), prohibiting application for adjustment of rent on sale price until six months from date of sale and providing that adjustment may not be effective before one year from date of sale or prior to date of issue of order, and that such provisions applied to applications pending when law became effective, not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- provisions reasonably necessary for public welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. By chapter 337 of the Laws of 1961, which became a law on April 6, 1961, there was added to the Emergency Housing Rent Control Law a provision that &quot;No application for adjustment of maximum rent valuation based upon a sale price valuation shall be filed by the landlord under this subparagraph prior to six months from the date of such sale of the property.  In addition, no adjustment ordered by the commission based upon such sales price valuation shall be effective prior to one year from the date of such sale.&quot; As revised in 1961, the law forbade retroactive changes in rent, and the 1961 amendments were applicable to pending proceedings.  The statutory changes are not unconstitutional.  They were enacted following investigation by the Legislature.  The Legislature was aware that apartments could be and were being sold continuously at inflated prices to take advantage of the higher rents. The writing of these precautions into law was reasonably necessary for the public welfare. Even if there were no record of any investigation, the courts would assume factual support for the legislation to exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff's constitutional rights were not infringed when the 1961 statute was made to apply to premises purchased at an earlier date. It had no interest in any particular rule so vested as to entitle it to keep the rule unchanged.  The applicability and validity of statutes are determined as of the date the court makes its decision.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant contended that N.Y. Ins. Law &sect;&sect; 42(3) and 193(2) should not be construed to prohibit it from acquiring a controlling interest in a fire or casualty insurance company. Respondent asserted that it determined that the statutory proscription was absolute and unqualified prohibiting a licensed life insurer from doing, either directly or through a stock-controlled subsidiary, any fire or casualty business. The court held that the Legislature did not intend that the limitations of N.Y. Ins. Law &sect;&sect; 42(3) and 193(2) be extended by implication to cover parent-subsidiary situations. There was no recognizable basis for forbidding appellant's investment. N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 90(1) should have been construed to allow the investment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 42 (subd. 3) and section 193 (subd. 2) of the Insurance Law, which forbid a foreign life insurance company licensed in this State from engaging in the business of writing fire or casualty insurance, were not intended to prohibit such foreign life insurance company from acquiring a controlling stock interest in a company doing a fire or casualty insurance business.  By purchasing a controlling interest in a fire or casualty company, the parent life insurance company is not actually engaging in that business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 90 of the Insurance Law, which regulates the investments of out-of-State insurers, does not interfere with the acquisition of a controlling stock interest in another insurer so long as the parent company has sufficient investments which comply strictly with the investment limitations imposed on domestic companies and a sufficient surplus for policyholders. </SPAN></P>

The court held that the prohibitions of &sect; 1141 applied only to &quot;hard-core pornography.&quot; Under &sect; 1141, the test of the obscene, of the pornographic, was not in the tendency or appeal of the material, but rather in its content objectively appraised. The court held that the obscene focused predominantly upon what was sexually morbid, grossly perverse, and bizarre, without any artistic or scientific purpose or justification. Recognizable by the insult it invariably offered to sex and to the human spirit, it was to be differentiated from the bawdy and the ribald. Depicting dirt for dirt's sake, the obscene was the vile, rather than the coarse, the blow to sense, not merely to sensibility.

Tax Law &sect; 2(6-a) constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The litigation stemmed from a statute, underlying which was an attempt to secure reimbursement from the taxpayers, trailer dwellers, for some share of the expense of providing them with police and fire protection, educational facilities and the various other services rendered by a municipality to persons residing within its confines. By making his more or less permanent home in a trailer, an individual could derive the benefit of all the services provided by the local government, while leaving the burden of paying for them upon his neighbors who lived in more conventional type dwellings. Although the inequities of this situation were readily apparent, there was seemingly no solution of the problem since the New York State tax against personal property had been repealed and trailers were traditionally considered to be personalty. The court affirmed the appellate court judgment finding that it was not for the court to determine whether the tax was fair, only whether the state had the authority to pass it, which it did.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- real property -- trailers -- Legislature had power to classify trailers as real property for purposes of taxation -- trailers may be assessed against real property on which they are located (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Real Property Tax Law, &sect; 102</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 12, par. [g]) -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 6-a of section 2 of the Tax Law (added by L. 1954, ch. 726) provided that the terms &quot;land&quot;, &quot;real estate&quot;, and &quot;real property&quot;, as used in the Tax Law, shall &quot;include all the forms of housing which are * * * commonly called * * * 'trailers'; except (1) transient trailers which have been located within the boundaries of a tax district for less than sixty days and (2) trailers which are for sale and which are not occupied&quot; and that &quot;Trailers shall be assessed to the owners of the real property on which they are located.&quot; The present statute (Real Property Tax Law, &sect; 102, subd. 12, par. [g]) is in effect a re-enactment of former subdivision 6-a of section 2 of the Tax Law and provides that &quot;The value of any trailer or mobile home shall be included in the assessment of the land on which it is located&quot;.  While it now directs the assessment against the land, instead of against the owner of the land, section 304 of the Real Property Tax Law still provides as heretofore that &quot;All assessments shall be against the real property itself&quot;.  The Legislature intended the original statute to be read as it was re-enacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Legislature has the power to classify trailers as real property for purposes of taxation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is a rational basis for the legislative classification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The trailers may be assessed against the real property on which they are located.  The situation is no different from that where a lessee erects a building or other improvement on the realty of his landlord. Where the fee is privately owned, the real property tax attaches to the combined interests of all the parties interested in the land and the improvements thereon.  The trailer park owner has the means at his disposal, by way of rent, to allocate the increased tax upon the owner of the trailer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The statute is not unconstitutional because the aggregate tax assessed against the land is computed by reference to the value of the property of more than one owner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The law is not unconstitutional on its face because inequities may result from its application.  If the statute is not properly administered, a proceeding may be brought to challenge the tax allegedly improperly assessed, and the action complained of may be reviewed.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the transportation authority was an arm or agency of the state and that the legislature could in creating the transportation authority have refused to waive immunity as to it and thus could have forbidden suits to be maintained against the transportation authority in any court or tribunal. While the legislature created jurisdiction in certain tribunals for actions against the transportation authority, under no circumstances did the legislature create jurisdiction for a tribunal to entertain an equity action. While this left the injured party without any remedy by suit, the court noted that the immunity of a state agency was in no way affected by the lack of any other remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insurers sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) that reversed a trial court's order granting the insurers' petition to annul a regulation promulgated by respondent New York State Superintendent of Insurance, which set premium rates for credit life insurance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superintendent promulgated a regulation that set forth standards that insurers were required to meet for premium rates on credit life insurance. The insurers petitioned the trial court to have the regulation annulled on the grounds that it was discriminatory and eliminated competition. The Superintendent filed a motion to dismiss the petition, claiming that the insurers did not have standing because they had not been injured in any way by the regulation. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss and granted the insurers' petition. The appellate court reversed the trial court's order and dismissed the insurers' petition. The insurers' appealed, and the court affirmed the appellate court's order. The court held that the Superintendent, as an administrative official, was authorized by statute to disapprove premium rates that were unreasonable in relation to the benefits provided and to prescribe regulations for determining the procedures and terms applicable to credit insurance policies. The court found that the standards under the regulation were not vague or otherwise inadequate so as to amount to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the appellate court's order that reversed the trial court's order denying the Superintendent's motion to dismiss the insurers' petition to annul a regulation promulgated by the superintendent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- credit life insurance -- rates -- pursuant to statutory authority (Insurance Law, &sect; 154, subd. 7; &sect; 204, subd. 1, par. [c]), Superintendent of Insurance promulgated regulation setting forth premium rates for credit life insurance which would be considered adequate and not unreasonable in relation to benefits provided and permitted insurers to establish, independently, factors justifying higher rates than those suggested by Superintendent -- regulations were within Superintendent's statutory powers -- petitioners may maintain present proceeding before</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> applying for approval of rates -- regulation does not shift burden of proof as to rates from Superintendent to insurer -- statutory standard that premium rates approved be not &quot;unreasonable in relation to the benefits provided&quot; valid and sufficiently specific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 1 of section 154 of the Insurance Law had required the filing of accident or health insurance policy forms and rates with the Superintendent of Insurance and their approval by him.  By the addition of subdivision 7 to that section, the same requirements were prescribed for credit life insurance. That subdivision 7 provides that &quot;the superintendent shall not approve any such forms or premium rates if such premium rates are unreasonable in relation to the benefits provided&quot; and it authorizes the Superintendent &quot;from time to time&quot; to &quot;prescribe, in writing, official regulations&quot; dealing with credit insurance. Subdivision 1 (par. [c]) of section 204 of the Insurance Law, which deals with group life insurance premium rates, was similarly amended and contains almost identical provisions for the Superintendent's approval of rates and his right to make official regulations. Pursuant to the statutory amendments,  the Superintendent promulgated Regulation 27A.  Subdivision A of section 7 of the regulation set forth premium rates, later referred to as &quot;standards&quot; for premium rates, which &quot;will be considered adequate and not unreasonable in relation to the benefits provided&quot;.  The Superintendent later amended Regulation 27A by adding a new subdivision C to section 7 thereof to permit insurers to establish independently factors or conditions to justify higher rates than those suggested by the Superintendent in subdivision A of section 7.  Subdivision 7 of section 154 and section 204 (subd. 1, par. [c]) of the Insurance Law authorize the Superintendent to disapprove premium rates which are &quot;unreasonable in relation to the benefits provided&quot; and direct him to prescribe regulations for determining procedures and terms applicable to credit insurance policies.  Whether or not this permits him to make or fix rates, it is within his statutory powers to suggest reasonable ones while affording insurers freedom to show that higher rates would not be unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioners are entitled to maintain the present proceeding before they apply for approval of their rates.  Section 34 of the Insurance Law provides that any regulation as well as order or decision of the Superintendent is subject to review under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act.  The statute does not require that only action taken in pursuance of a regulation may be reviewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The regulation does not shift the burden of proof with respect to reasonableness of rates from the Superintendent to the insurer. Whether an insurer files its rates for approval or seeks to prove that the statutory conditions have been met, the requirement for obtaining such approval is the same.  The premium rates must be not &quot;unreasonable in relation to the benefits provided&quot;.  The regulation does not alter the insurer's statutory responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The standards laid down in subdivision 7 of section 154 and subdivision 1 (par. [c]) of section 204, that the premium rates approved be not &quot;unreasonable in relation to the benefits provided&quot;, are valid and sufficiently specific.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff tenant, a stockholder of a private limited dividend co-operative corporation organized under the N.Y. State Housing Law, filed an against respondents, Commissioner of Housing of the State of New York and co-operative corporation. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) held the tenant was subject to a 25 percent surcharge or eviction, N.Y. Pub. Hous. Law &sect; 182(3)(b). The tenant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">N.Y. Pub. Hous. Law &sect; 182(3)(b) provided that the apartments were to be available for persons or families whose probable aggregate annual income did not exceed specified ratios. If tenants' income increased, they might have been permitted to remain, subject to the commissioner's approval. In 1960, the section was amended to specify that the tenant's rent should have been increased in proportion to his ability to pay more. Rejecting the tenant's argument that a contract was impermissibly impaired, the court noted that the specific object of the statute was to eradicate slum dwellings by providing the occupants of those premises safe and sanitary low-cost apartments to which they could remove, and the co-operative corporation's charter incorporated the statute and any amendments the legislature might have made. Affirming the decision in part, the court noted that the provisions imposing a surcharge in lieu of eviction upon attaining a certain income level also had a tendency to promote the statutory purpose as did the eviction provisions, but the commission did not have the authority to impose the surcharge before the legislative amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the declaratory action the tenant brought against the commissioner and the co-operative corporation, the court affirmed the portion of the decision that held that the tenant was subject to eviction or a 25 percent surcharge, but modified the part of the decision that held that the tenant was subject to the surcharge before the 1960 legislative amendment became effective.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- public housing -- tenant stockholder of private limited dividend co-operative corporation and said corporation may constitutionally be subjected to provisions of section 182 (subd. 3, par. [b]) of Public Housing Law which contains income qualification, surcharge and eviction provisions as to tenants in such housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff, a tenant stockholder of Amalgamated Housing Corporation, a private limited dividend co-operative corporation organized under the State Housing Law, and said corporation may constitutionally be subjected to the provisions of section 182 (subd. 3, par. [b]) of the Public Housing Law containing income qualification, surcharge and eviction provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 3 (par. [b]) of section 182 of the Public Housing Law, relating to co-operative housing companies and projects, provided at the time this action was instituted that apartments in such projects &quot;heretofore or hereafter constructed&quot; shall be available for persons or families whose probable aggregate annual income does not exceed a stated income to rental ratio, and that an occupant whose income increases beyond the prescribed ratios may be permitted to remain in occupancy for three years with possible extensions, subject to approval by the Housing Commissioner.  While plaintiff's appeal in this action was pending in the Appellate Division, the Legislature added the following clause to paragraph (b) of subdivision 3, effective March 8, 1960: &quot;However, the rent of such occupant [allowed to remain by permission of the commissioner though his income has increased above the statutory maximum] shall be increased in proportion to his ability to pay more, the amount of increase to be ruled upon and prescribed by the housing company with the approval of the commissioner.&quot; (L. 1960, ch. 160.) The court passes upon the applicability and validity of the statute as it existed on the date of the appeal, rather than the date of the commencement of the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The provisions of the Public Housing Law, which replaced the State Housing Law in 1939, are applicable to plaintiff and the housing corporation.  The 1949 amendments (L. 1949, chs. 616, 761) of paragraphs (a) and (b) of subdivision 3 of section 182, introducing the word &quot;heretofore&quot; into the subdivision, which previously read &quot;hereafter&quot; only, made clear the intention to render section 182 applicable to all housing company projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Such application does not violate constitutional guarantees.  There is no impairment of contractual obligations or taking of property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. By the express terms of the State Housing Law, any contract or rights acquired thereunder were qualified ones.  The housing corporation expressly agreed in its certificate of incorporation &quot;that all real estate acquired by it and all structures erected by it, shall be deemed to be acquired for the purpose of promoting the public health and safety and subject to the provisions of the state housing law.&quot; (State Housing Law, &sect; 30, subd. 13.) The State Housing Law, incorporated by reference into the corporation's charter, was always subject to change in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The amendments to section 182 here in issue were reasonable statutory revisions designed to promote the objects of the statute and the public health and safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The provisions imposing a surcharge in lieu of eviction upon attaining a certain income level have a tendency to promote the statutory purpose, as does the eviction provision, since a tenant subjected to a surcharge may thereby be induced to remove to better accommodations.  The Legislature, having the power to require removal upon the tenant's attaining a certain income level, could properly enact alternative provisions within its discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Until March, 1960, paragraph (b) of subdivision 3 did not contain a surcharge provision.  Prior to that time the surcharge was imposed solely by virtue of a regulation of the Housing Commissioner.  The Commissioner's regulation was invalid.  It contravened the legislative intent to accord co-operatives separate and special treatment as to surcharges until the time of the amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The 1960 amendment is not intended to have retroactive effect to validate the Commissioner's imposition of surcharges </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">nunc pro tunc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Plaintiff was not subject to a surcharge prior to March 8, 1960.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff importer appealed from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) that reversed an order of the trial court denying defendant buyer's motion to dismiss the complaint and that dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The importer brought an action against the buyer, alleging that the buyer had violated N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2354(6) by rebottling or repackaging the importer's toilet water and selling them at prices less than those charged by the importer. The trial court denied the buyer's motion to dismiss. The appellate court reversed the denial and ordered the case dismissed. The court reversed the judgment and held that, under the statute's literal construction, the importer's complaint alleged a violation by the buyer. The court noted that the statute was designed to prevent adulteration and substitution of spurious goods for the original without discovery and to prevent fraud. The possibility of fraud, or at least of inadvertent adulteration of the original product, was not appreciably lessened by a label on the new container acknowledging that the product had been rebottled from the original. The buyer still traded upon the reputation of the importer's trademark. Accordingly, no exception was made in the statute for collateral use of the trademark. Because the alleged criminal acts threatened the importer's property rights, trademark, and good will, an injunction was warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the appellate court was reversed and the motion to dismiss the importer's complaint against the buyer was denied, with costs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Injunctions -- rebottling in violation of Penal Law -- complaint which alleges that corporate defendants purchase plaintiff's toilet waters and rebottle or repackage same and sell them at less than prices charged by plaintiff states cause of action under section 2354 (subd. 6) of Penal Law which renders person who offers goods for sale, which are represented to be the product of another person, firm or corporation, guilty of misdemeanor unless goods are contained in original package.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The complaint alleges that plaintiff corporation imports various perfumes and perfume extracts from France and sells the same either in original packages, as imported, or as toilet water which plaintiff packages in this State under labels, marks and names placed thereon for and by plaintiff, and under brand names, and that the corporate defendants are purchasers of plaintiff's toilet waters who systematically rebottle or repackage the same in containers of one dram each and sell them at prices far less than those charged by plaintiff.  The complaint states a cause of action under subdivision 6 of section 2354 of the Penal Law which provides that &quot;A person who: * * * 6. Knowingly sells, offers or exposes for sale, any goods which are represented in any manner, by word or deed, to be the manufacture, packing, bottling, boxing or product of any person, firm or corporation, other than himself, unless such goods are contained in the original package, box or bottle and under the labels, marks or names placed thereon by the manufacturer who is entitled to use such marks, names, brands or trade-marks; or, * * * Is guilty of a misdemeanor&quot;.  If the statute is construed literally, the complaint alleges a violation by the defendants.  The evident purpose of the statute is such that it may and should be read and construed literally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In enacting the statute to prohibit transactions and business practices where fraud and deception are possible and to protect the trade-mark owner, the Legislature acted within its police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The alleged criminal acts also threaten plaintiff's property rights, trade-mark, and good will, and an injunction, therefore, is available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The complaint sufficiently set forth causes of action against the individual defendants by alleging that they are officers, &quot;and, directly or indirectly&quot; are owners of the corporate stock and in control of corporate activities.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants contended that &sect; 1141 was on its face unconstitutional in that it was vague and the imputation of knowledge to defendants amounted to a denial of their inalienable &quot;liberty&quot; interest protected by due process. Defendants also argued that the trial court erroneously construed &sect; 1141 to supply what the legislature deliberately omitted. The people countered that &sect; 1141 was constitutional and defendants' guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt. The appeal was the court's first opportunity to construe &sect; 1141. The court reversed the judgments, ordered new trials, and held that: (1) the &sect; 1141 definition of the crime was instinct with the idea of scienter; (2) New York jurisprudence neither expressly, nor by the court's construction, dispensed with the vital element of scienter and did not impinge upon the traditional freedom guarantees of speech and the press; (3) although &sect; 1141 might possibly have been interpreted to exclude scienter it was not intended to unreasonably restrict or inhibit the inalienable &quot;liberty&quot; protected by due process; and (4) because &sect; 1141 was at least susceptible of the differing interpretations the court was obliged to preserve its validity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant and its subscribers filed an application to incorporate as a domestic membership corporation under &sect; 10 of the Membership Corporation Law. In addition, appellant filed an application with the Secretary of State to accept and file a certificate of incorporation, which did not have the approval of respondent justice of the supreme court. The justice denied the approval. Subsequently, appellant filed a petition with appellate division for an order directing the justice to annul and revoke both of his opinions, and to approve the certificate. The justice filed a cross-motion to dismiss said petition. The appellant division denied appellant's petition, but granted the justice's motion. Further, the appellate division denied relief by way of mandamus against the Secretary of State. Appellant sought review of both orders on constitutional grounds. The appeals were consolidated. The court affirmed the order denying relief by way of mandamus but reversed the order granting the justice's motion to dismiss.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A proposed certificate of incorporation, whose charter purpose was, in part, to promote the right to individual freedom of choice and association, constituting the right of the individual to associate with only those persons with whom he desires to associate, was presented for the approval of a Justice of the Supreme Court.  Denial of approval was based upon public policy, or injury to the community, or both.  Section 10 of the Membership Corporations Law provides that: &quot;Five or more persons may become a membership corporation for any lawful purpose * * *.  Every certificate of incorporation filed under this chapter shall have endorsed thereon or annexed thereto the approval of a justice of the supreme court of the judicial district in which the office of the corporation is to be located.&quot; The function of the Justice before whom the application is made is to ascertain whether the proposed incorporation is for a lawful purpose. A Justice is not at liberty to grant or deny applications based on his personal notion of what is contrary to public policy or injurious to the community.  The public policy of the State is not violated by purposes which are not unlawful.  The test as to what may be injurious to the community is too vague, indefinite and elusive to serve as an objective judicial standard.  The purposes expressed in the proffered certificate of incorporation are not unlawful, and hence there is no legal basis for its rejection.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant New York State Commissioner of Harness Racing (commissioner) challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, First Judicial Department, (New York), which affirmed a trial court order granting respondent racetrack's application for an order directing the commissioner to credit the racetrack's construction accounts with federal income taxes paid under 1956 N.Y. Laws ch. 837 of the New York Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A racetrack filed a petition for an order directing the commissioner to credit its construction account funds with federal income taxes paid pursuant to 1956 N.Y. Laws ch. 837, &sect; 45. The trial court granted the order and the appellate division affirmed. The commissioner sought review. The court reversed the appellate division's order and dismissed the petition. The lower courts properly construed &sect; 45 in concluding that it provided for credits for federal income taxes, and an amendment of the statute, 1959 N.Y. Laws ch. 881, &sect;&sect; 7, 10, did not retroactively alter the statute's plain meaning. However, the amendment specifically provided that no harness track should be reimbursed for federal income taxes paid before or after the amendment. The legislature was free to make a prospective tax change under N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 1, which barred any contract for a pre-established limit on tax liability. The amendments did not impose an invalid retroactive change in the racetrack's tax liability because it did not alter any taxes already paid, but affected only the racetrack's future tax liability. The commissioner properly refused to credit the racetrack's account.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the appellate division order affirming a supreme court order and dismissed a racetrack's petition for an order directing the commissioner to credit the racetrack's construction accounts with a sum representing federal income taxes paid by the racetrack.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- harness racing -- under 1959 amendment of Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law (&sect; 45-a), harness race track not entitled to reimbursement for Federal taxes on amount transferred to its general account from construction</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> account to which had been transferred part of State's share of amount wagered at track -- amendment intended to apply to improvements already constructed -- no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> impairment of contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under section 45-a, added to the Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law in 1956, any tax above an amount equal to that paid by a harness racing track in the year 1955 was to be divided, half to be paid to the State and the other half to be deposited by the track in its own name in a so-called &quot;construction account&quot;.  Subdivisions 6 (par. [b]) and 10 provided that, at the end of each year, a harness racing track which had completed a capital improvement with the approval of the Harness Racing Commission might transfer to its own general account the money in its construction account, &quot;until such date as the amounts paid to such harness race track from the construction account, less income taxes paid thereon to the United States by such harness race track, equals the cost of the capital improvement&quot;.  In 1959 the Legislature amended section 45-a to prohibit the approval of the Harness Racing Commission of any new capital expenditures thereunder (L. 1959, ch. 881, &sect; 7) and provided that no harness racing track &quot;shall be reimbursed&quot; from the construction account &quot;for any income taxes paid to the United States&quot;, whether paid before or after the effective date of the amendment (L. 1959, ch. 881, &sect; 7, amdg. &sect; 45-a, subd. 10; see, also, L. 1959, ch. 881, &sect; 10).  Roosevelt Raceway, Inc., completed capital improvements in 1957 at a cost of $ 19,605,281.  The amount in its construction account for that year was $ 2,858,495, and that sum was transferred to its general account. Receipt of such sum resulted in a Federal income tax of $ 1,404,665.  In view of the explicit declaration of the 1959 statute that no harness racing track may be reimbursed from the construction account for any income taxes paid to the United States, &quot;whether paid before or after the effective date of this section&quot;, Roosevelt Raceway is not entitled to reimbursement for these Federal taxes and its petition to compel the Commission to record a credit for such taxes must be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The 1959 amendment was intended to apply to improvements previously authorized and already constructed, and not, as claimed, to projects to be completed after the amendment became effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Resort may not be had to legislative history to construe the unambiguous language of the 1959 enactment; in any event, the legislative history is not in conflict with the plain meaning of this statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The 1959 amendment, insofar as it put an end to the State's obligation to reimburse for Federal taxes, does not represent an unconstitutional impairment of a contractual obligation (U. S. Const., art. I, &sect; 10).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The 1959 amendment is entirely prospective in its operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The courts below rightly rejected the contention of the Attorney-General that the 1956 statute, properly construed, did not provide for inclusion of the Federal income tax in ascertaining and determining the amount of reimbursement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The Legislature in 1959 &quot;clarified&quot; the 1956 statute by declaring that section 45-a, as written and enacted in 1956, was not intended to provide for the reimbursement of Federal income taxes (L. 1959, ch. 881, &sect; 10).  The Legislature has no power to declare, retroactively, that an existing statute shall receive a given construction when such a construction is contrary to that which the statute would ordinarily have received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Legislation will be held unconstitutional only as a last resort.  Arguments that section 45-a as originally enacted in 1956 is totally unconstitutional are not considered since the petition must be dismissed even if the constitutional questions raised were decided in petitioner's favor.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Property owners filed claims for damages arising out of an alleged de facto appropriation of land for use in the reconstruction of a state highway, which was widened. The property owners claimed that in performing that work, the state encroached on lands owned by them. The trial court dismissed the property owners' claims, and the appellate court affirmed. The property owners appealed, but the court affirmed the dismissal. It was established as a fact that the highway at issue was the old Seneca Turnpike, which was laid out under color of statute. Thus, the state acquired a right of way by prescription to a width as provided for in the statute. The state had a prescriptive right to the width prescribed by the statute, even though it was greater than the extent of actual use. Compensation was properly disallowed for the alleged encroachment on land within the right of way, and because the property owners had not established any measure of damages relating to the encroachment on land that was not in the right of way, no award was made.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgments that affirmed the dismissal of the property owners' claims for compensation by the state for an alleged encroachment upon land owned by the property owners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the course of the reconstruction of a State highway, the two-lane concrete sections of the road were widened from 20 feet to 48 feet, with the result that the State allegedly encroached on claimants' property on the north of the highway. The highway originally came into existence pursuant to a statute (L. 1800, ch. 78), which provided for a right of way 99 feet wide, but the highway was not improved to its full width. Where a road has been laid out under a statute, it is the statute and not user that determines the width. The failure of the State to occupy the full width, or to improve the road in the manner provided, does not constitute an abandonment of the easement of the unused portion.  The alleged encroachment on the north of the highway being within the right of way, compensation was properly disallowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The parcels on the south side of the highway were outside of the right of way. In any event, claimants had not established any measure of damages relating to that encroachment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since the road was laid out under a statute, the State acquired a right of way by prescription to a width of 99 feet as provided for in the statute.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, an alleged mentally ill person, sought review of an order entered in favor of respondent medical officer by the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed in part the trial court's order that ratified and confirmed a county judge's order directing the alleged mentally ill person's admission to a hospital and denying her motion to declare invalid and unconstitutional N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect;&sect; 74, 76.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The alleged mentally ill person, who had not received personal service of notice or a hearing, was certified to the state hospital for observation and treatment for a period not exceeding 60 days by order of the county judge. The alleged mentally ill person challenged the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 74, 76 insofar as they permitted continued confinement without the prior notice or hearing, which she maintained was required by the due process clauses of the state and federal Constitutions. The court affirmed the order and held that: 1) the statute was not unconstitutional as denying due process because the finality of the order was subject to the right of review; 2) the continued confinement could be challenged immediately after the filing of a &sect; 74 certificate; and 3) the 30 day period of limitation withdrawing the right to challenge the confinement did not begin to run until notice of the filing had been given.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the certification order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insane and other incompetent persons -- incompetency hearing -- notice -- appellant's temporary commitment to institution for mentally ill without personal notice of application valid -- commitment order achieves tentative finality upon filing of certificate of necessity of continued treatment -- continuance of confinement beyond temporary period not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> where patient has right to complete rehearing of determination -- certification order provides for disclosure of papers to parties and interested persons -- patient must receive actual personal service of notice before 30-day</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> period during which demand may be made for jury trial challenging commitment commences to run -- court not compelled to imply provision that notice shall not be given -- due process satisfied where commitment order and finding as to need for continued treatment are subject to review before becoming conclusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. Upon the petition of appellant's husband and the medical statements of two examining physicians, appellant was certified to an institution for the mentally ill by order of a County Judge for observation and treatment for a period not exceeding 60 days.  The order further provided that, if within the 60-day period a person in charge of the institution filed a certificate that continued care and treatment were required, the temporary commitment order would become final.  Appellant was not personally served with notice of the original application for the commitment order since, under section 74 of the Mental Hygiene Law, notice may be dispensed with, nor did she receive notice of the filing of the certificate. Appellant petitioned for a jury trial pursuant to section 76 of the Mental Hygiene Law, which provides that a committed person may obtain a review of the final order within 30 days after the making of such order.  The petition was denied as being untimely, since it was not made within 30 days after the filing of the certificate. Appellant's temporary confinement without actual personal notice to her was valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The continuance of confinement beyond the temporary period is not violative of due process or otherwise unconstitutional, since the patient has the right to a prompt and complete rehearing of the determination </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ab initio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> under section 76, and thus the finality of the court order is subject to the right of review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The fact that a hearing is not provided for until after the certification order has become final does not invalidate the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Appellant's contention that at the hearing she will have no means of determining what proof will be offered against her is without merit, since the order of certification provides for disclosure of the papers to parties and properly interested persons upon court order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The arguments in favor of dispensing with notice of the original application for the commitment order are not applicable once the patient has been received in custody.  Nothing short of actual personal service of notice upon the patient that the 30-day period in which she must make her demand for a jury trial has commenced to run will suffice to commence the running of this period of limitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. No express provision is contained in section 76 that notice shall not be given to the patient, and the court is not compelled to imply such a provision, especially where such a construction might render the statute violative of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Inasmuch as the initial temporary order of commitment is subject to the review provisions of section 76, it cannot be final if review is invoked until after a determination by the court in the section 76 proceeding.  Thus appellant is in fact offered the opportunity to challenge before the court the findings as to the need for continued treatment contained in the filed certificate before that finding becomes conclusive upon her and due process is thus satisfied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, landowner and operator of a sand and gravel pit, appealed from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which upheld the constitutionality of Ordinance No. 16 of respondent town, and enjoining them from operating a sand and gravel pit until a permit has been issued by the town, and certain violations of the said ordinance have been corrected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sand and gravel pit at issue was located in the midst of a densely populated residential area. In order to provide protection against the danger of cave-ins, falls, drowning and water pollution, the town passed Hempstead, NY, Ordinance No. 16 which made provision for setbacks, degrees of slope, barricades, fences, lights, retaining walls and maximum ground water level. The town sought an injunction against the landowner and the operator of the sand and gravel pit which conditioned future operation of the pit upon the issuance of a permit from the town and the correction of certain violations of the ordinance. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance and issued the requested injunction. On appeal, the Court of Appeals of New York rejected the argument that ordinance was confiscatory and unconstitutionally violated the right to due process, noting that neither the injunction granted nor the ordinance proscribed any future excavation. Because there was a rational basis for the legislative choice and no factual support for declaring it arbitrary, the court affirmed the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special Term properly upheld the constitutionality of an ordinance of the Town of Hempstead regulating defendants' sand and gravel business and enjoined defendants from conducting sand mining and excavation on certain property in the town until a permit had been issued and certain violations of the ordinance had been corrected. Defendants' proof failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality and to establish the unreasonableness of the regulations. The sand and gravel pit lies in the midst of a densely populated residential area. In order to provide protection against the danger of cave-ins, falls, drowning and water pollution, the ordinance makes provision for setbacks, degrees of slopes, barricades, fences, lights, retaining walls and maximum ground water level. Future excavation is not enjoined. It has not been demonstrated that the minimal safety standards required by the town are an unreasonable means to protect against the hazards to both life and property accompanying the uncontrolled operation of these pits. There was a rational basis for the legislative action and no factual support for declaring it arbitrary.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for having had in his possession, in his right pocket, an ordinary two-bladed small pocket penknife in violation of &sect; 436-5.2. The appellate court affirmed the conviction. Defendant appealed, arguing that carrying a penknife could not have been made a crime. On appeal, by permission, the court reversed defendant's conviction and dismissed the complaint. The court held that &sect; 436-5.2 was too vague and too general to indicate what persons were included or what acts were prohibited. Carrying a pocket penknife or many of the other articles included in &sect;436-5.2 was not evil in itself. Guilt, if any, consisted entirely in violation of a legislative fiat. Therefore, it was necessary that the elements of the offense were spelled out in words even more explicitly, so that the citizen could receive unequivocal warning before conduct otherwise innocent be made the cause of fine or imprisonment. While juvenile delinquents could have been highly dangerous, especially in large cities, they cannot be legislated out of existence, however, nor held guilty of offenses on the sole basis of status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested for loitering after police officers observed defendant standing on a pier for an extended period of time. On appeal, defendant contended that the Act was unconstitutional and the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support a conviction. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court held that the Act did not offend constitutional guarantees. The Act was directed at preventing the necessary evils that came with criminal activity that was known to occur at the waterfront, such as loansharking and book-making. The Act was not vague and indefinite and specifically prohibited loitering at the waterfront facility.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the order of the supreme court and dismissed the information. The court held that &sect; 436-d was unconstitutional. The statute actually enacted, went far beyond any purpose to avert criminal activity by booksellers or others to cheat magazine publishers out of their fees. By absolutely forbidding any person from selling any coverless magazine, regardless of the circumstances under which, or the reasons for which, the cover may have been removed, the legislature prohibited unquestionably legitimate sales and rendered criminal conduct that carried not the slightest taint of corruption or impropriety. The actual sale of the coverless magazines was not wrong, but their sale by a vendor who took part in a scheme to defraud a magazine publisher.</SPAN></P>

The purpose of the statute was to prevent the sale of magazines or other periodicals recalled by the publisher or returned for credit.  The statute goes beyond its purpose.  It prohibits legitimate sales and renders criminal conduct which is not corrupt or improper.  Even if it be assumed that the Legislature had the power to prohibit the sales which it intended to prohibit, it is beyond the police power to prohibit all sales in order to prevent those which are improper.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, in Queens County (New York), that affirmed a judgment by the county court convicting defendant of the crime of attempted robbery in the third degree upon a plea of guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that he was denied due process when, after an indictment against him had been dismissed for want of a speedy trial, he was re-indicted for the same crime. Specifically, defendant claimed that his rights were infringed when, in reliance on N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 673, he was re-indicted on the same charge which was the basis of an indictment against him and dismissed nearly three years later on his motion made under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 668, for failure of the people to bring the cause to trial. The court held that the appellate division erred when it affirmed the conviction because to allow such re-indictment, even though within the statute of limitations, would have denied defendant of his right to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment that convicted defendant of attempted robbery in the third degree and dismissed the indictment against him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- right to speedy trial -- where defendant was indicted in January, 1955 and arraigned in October, 1956 and Appellate Division later determined that he had been denied speedy trial, reindictment in November, 1958 for same crime denied him right to speedy and public trial (Code Crim.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was indicted in January, 1955 and was arraigned in October, 1956.  In December, 1957 the Appellate Division determined that he had been denied a speedy trial. In November, 1958 defendant was reindicted for the same crime.  His motion to dismiss this indictment because of delay should have been granted.  Defendant is entitled to a speedy and public trial (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 8; Civil Rights Law, &sect; 12) and is entitled to this statutory guarantee even though it is not a constitutional guarantee. The right to a prompt trial is fundamental.</SPAN></P>

The testator left a will executed in 1918 and a version of that will was admitted to probate without erasures and interlineations in 1955. A probate proceeding concerning other wills was pending in the foreign nation when the state trial court assumed jurisdiction to probate the 1955 will. The court reversed the order insofar as appealed from. The court held that under N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act &sect; 147, any person interested in a will as devisee, legatee, or otherwise could file objections to the probate of the will. The foreign government's claim on the assets of the estate in the event of intestacy qualified it to file objections under the statute because its rights could be affected if the will was probated in the state. There was no reason why the state's attorney general should be allowed to intervene while the government of the nation where the testator and all of his descendants were domiciled was excluded.</SPAN></P>

A court of British Honduras ordered that a will purportedly executed in 1918 be admitted to probate &quot;until a later will be found&quot;.  Thereafter an action was brought in a British Honduras court to have the 1918 will declared revoked and to probate an alleged will of 1955 as a lost or destroyed testament and while that action remained undetermined the Surrogate in New York County assumed jurisdiction to probate the 1955 will.  Section 147 of the Surrogate's Court Act permits any person to file objections to the probate of a will who is &quot;interested in the event as devisee, legatee or otherwise&quot;.  The Government of British Honduras, which claims the assets in this estate wherever situated under its statute entitling it to recover in the event of intestacy in default of lawful distributees, and enabling it to use the assets to &quot;provide, in accordance with the existing practice, for dependents, whether kindred or not, of the intestate, and other persons for whom the intestate might reasonably have been expected to make provision&quot;, should be permitted to intervene in the New York proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner operated a building supply yard on its property. The village amended the building zone ordinance and placed the property in a new residential district. The property owner filed an action against the village for a declaration that the rezoning of its property was unconstitutional. Although the trial court found that the property owner produced evidence to prove that the property was not practical or profitable for residential purposes, it dismissed the property owner's complaint because there was no deprivation of property where a nonconforming use existed. The appellate court affirmed, and the court reversed and remitted. The court held that the property owner was entitled to equitable relief if the deliberate confiscation and depreciation of its property was a present invasion of its property rights. The court rejected the village's argument that the property owner failed to exhaust its administrative remedy. The property owner was not required to apply for a variance as a condition precedent to a judicial remedy because it alleged that the ordinance destroyed the marketability and value of the property for commercial and residential uses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action for judgment declaring that the rezoning of plaintiff's property was unreasonable and confiscatory, the trial court, although finding that plaintiff produced evidence which might be sufficient to prove that the property could not be practically or profitably used for residential purposes, dismissed the complaint, stating that, because of the existence of a nonconforming use, there was no justiciable controversy or deprivation of property by the zoning restrictions placed upon plaintiff's property.  The trial court erred in failing to decide whether the alleged deliberate confiscation and alleged resulting depreciation in value of plaintiff's property, regardless of the existence of a nonconforming use, constitutes a present invasion on plaintiff's property rights. If it does so, the existence and maintenance of the ordinance and the threat to continue it under these circumstances would entitle plaintiff to equitable relief. Plaintiff is entitled to try to prove that the property is so situated that it has no possibility for residential and zoned uses and is most readily adaptable to use now precluded under the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court affirmed, finding that the landlord's evidence, as developed at the trial, served only to demonstrate that the intensity of the emergency which prevailed in 1955 had moderated to some extent, but not in substantial degree. However, the Legislature had implemented a program of gradual relaxation of controls. The court concluded that such a process of gradual, rather than abrupt, cessation of controls, commensurate with the moderation in market conditions, effectuated a transition from controls to normal landlord-tenant relations in a rational and orderly manner, without economic disruption and dislocation. Such a program was designed to protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and was hardly capricious and arbitrary or otherwise violative of constitutional guarantees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The association challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect;&sect; 7601-7614, which dealt with the certification of psychologists. The appellate division affirmed the constitutionality of the New York Education Law. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the New York Education Law helped the public identify those who had appropriate training and background in the profession of psychology through the medium of official certification of qualifications. The court also found that the New York Education Law afforded protection against the incompetent practitioner by providing a yardstick by which the public could judge the competence of persons offering psychological services. The court further determined that the lack of a definition for psychologist did not render the New York Education Law unconstitutional because the law was easily complied with by the non-use of particular words.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Article 153 of the Education Law, which proscribes the professional use of the title &quot;psychologist&quot; and its derivatives for remuneration by those who are not certified in accord with the statute, is not unconstitutional.  The statute is reasonably related to the public health and welfare and constitutes a proper exercise of the State's police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The failure of the statute to include a formal definition of &quot;psychologist&quot; or its derivatives does not render the statute unconstitutional.  There was no invalid delegation of legislative power. The statute prescribes discernible standards to govern the exercise of the power of certification. In practical effect a psychologist is defined as an individual who meets prescribed standards of fitness (Education Law &sect; 7605).  Since the statute merely proscribes the use of specific words to describe the rendition of services, without making it criminal for those not certified to render such services, no further definition of that term is constitutionally required or necessary.  </SPAN></P>

Property owners appealed the reversal arguing that the rezoning was illegal as &quot;contract zoning&quot; because the town board, as a condition for rezoning, required the owners to execute and record restrictive covenants. The court of appeals affirmed. It held that the restrictive covenants were intended for the benefit of the neighbors. Because the owners accepted them, there was no one in a position to contest them. To meet increasing needs of the county's own population explosion, and at the same time to make as gradual and as little of an annoyance as possible the change from residence to business on the main highways, the town board imposed conditions.

It would have been unreasonably punitive to withhold benefits to the former employee because the employers, which paid unemployment taxes for the former employee, were communist. The court disagreed with the appellate division with regard to the participation of the state and national communist parties in the state unemployment insurance program. Under the Federal Communist Control Act (Act), 50 U.S.C.S. &sect; 842, the Communist Party was not entitled to the rights, privileges, and immunities on the same basis as other entities.

Penal Law &sect; 600. The County Court of Tioga County (New York) entered judgment, finding defendant guilty on all 17 counts, sentenced him to 60 days in jail upon each count concurrently, and imposed a fine of $ 250 on each count. On review, the appellate division affirmed. Defendant appealed again.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was called as a witness before the grand jury. He subsequently refused to answer 17 questions concerning a well-attended meeting at a country estate, arguing to do so might tend to incriminate him. Thereupon, at the request of the district attorney, the grand jury conferred immunity upon defendant and ordered him to answer the questions previously put to him. The same 17 questions were again asked and defendant, reiterating his reliance upon the privilege, again refused to answer. As a consequence of his refusal, the grand jury indicted him. After a bench trial, he was convicted on all counts. On appeal, the court reversed and remitted for resentencing because defendant's conviction of 17 separate crimes of contempt, each susceptible to punishment of a year in prison, was totally unjustified.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, called as a witness before a Grand Jury which was investigating the so-called &quot;Apalachin meeting&quot;, refused to answer 17 questions concerning that meeting on the ground that to do so might tend to incriminate him.  He again refused to answer when he was granted immunity pursuant to section 2447 of the Penal Law. His conviction thereafter of 17 separate crimes of criminal contempt, each susceptible to a punishment of a year in prison, was not justified.  It was apparent from the beginning of his interrogation that, relying upon his privilege,  he would decline to answer any questions bearing on the &quot;Apalachin meeting&quot;.  The questions, although different from one another, all related to the one subject.  He is, therefore, guilty of a single contempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Grand Jury had power to confer immunity upon defendant and direct him to answer under pain of prosecution for contempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A witness may be compelled to answer in a state proceeding, as long as the immunity granted by the state protects against prosecution under its laws, even though it may not protect against prosecution by the federal government or by other states.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had her highbeam headlights on when a state trooper passed her. The trooper signaled for her to turn them off, but she failed to do so. The officer issued her a summons. At her trial, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information upon the ground that &sect; 15(3) was invalid and unconstitutional. The lower court denied her motion. Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 15(3) and was fined. The county court reversed because the language of &sect; 15(3) was vague. The court reversed. The court held that &sect; 15(3) was sufficiently definite, clear, and positive to give &quot;unequivocal warning&quot; to citizens of the rule to be obeyed. The phrase &quot;dazzling light&quot; in &sect; 15(3) referred to defendant's conduct in her use of high, as opposed to low, headlight beams. The word &quot;interfere&quot; in &sect; 15(3) referred to hampering or hindering the vision of the approaching trooper. Defendant's conviction was proper because she used her highbeam headlights and hindered the trooper's vision as he approached her vehicle on the road.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was convicted of failing to dim her automobile's headlights in violation of that part of subdivision 3 of section 15 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law which provides that, when an approaching vehicle is 500 or less feet away, a motorist proceeding toward it must operate multiple beam headlamps in such a manner &quot;that dazzling light does not interfere with the driver of the approaching vehicle&quot;.  That portion of the statute is sufficiently definite, clear and positive to give unequivocal warning of the rule to be obeyed and is constitutional.  The phrase &quot;dazzling light&quot; manifestly refers to the use of high, as opposed to low, headlight beams. The word &quot;interfere&quot; plainly means to hinder or hamper the vision of an approaching motorist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff realty company appealed the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the trial court's declaratory judgment for defendants, State Cemetery Board (board) and cemetery association, that N.Y. Membership Corp. Law &sect;&sect; 86-a, 87(2) were valid and constitutional insofar as they affected an agreement between the realty company and the cemetery association.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1910, the realty company and the cemetery association entered into an agreement to sell land for cemetery purposes. In consideration for the conveyance the cemetery association was to pay the realty company half the proceeds from the sales of burial lots from the tract, in conformance with N.Y. Membership Corp. Law &sect; 70 (1909). The board then informed the cemetery association that 1949 amendments to N.Y. Membership Corp. Law &sect;&sect; 86-a, 87(2) required it to deduct maintenance funds from the sales before remitting half of the purchase price to the realty company. The realty company brought an action to declare that &sect;&sect; 86-a, 87(2) unconstitutionally impaired their contractual rights and deprived them of property without due process of law, but the trial court entered a declaratory judgment affirming the validity of the sections. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment that &sect;&sect; 86-a, 87(2) were valid. The court held that the legislature intended for the new rule to apply to existing contracts, and that the laws were not invalid as to the realty company because disposal of funds from the sale of cemetery lots was subject to statutory regulation under the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Cemeteries -- maintenance funds -- under 1949 amendments to Membership Corporations Law (&sect; 86-a; &sect; 87, subd. 2), cemetery association which had contracted to pay its vendor one half of proceeds of sales of burial lots must, when it sells burial lot and establishes net sales price after selling expenses, deduct 10% for permanent maintenance fund and 15% for current maintenance fund and after these subtractions pay vendor 50% of remaining balance -- Legislature intended law to apply to existing contracts -- amendments are</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> constitutional as to vendor -- funds derived from sale of cemetery lots are dedicated to public use and disposal is subject to State's police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. By an agreement executed in 1910, plaintiff conveyed certain lands for cemetery purposes to defendant cemetery association and the cemetery association agreed that it would pay plaintiff &quot;one-half of the proceeds&quot; of sales of burial lots out of the tract.  The 1949 amendments to section 86-a and section 87 (subd. 2) of the Membership Corporations Law ordered every cemetery corporation to set up a permanent maintenance fund of not less than 10% of the gross proceeds of cemetery lot sales and a current maintenance fund of an additional 15% of such proceeds and provided that where a contract for sales of lands for cemetery purposes called for payment to the contract vendor of part of the proceeds of sales of burial lots, the amounts to go into the current and permanent maintenance funds must first be deducted from such sales proceeds before determining the contract vendor's share.  The statutes have been properly construed as meaning that the cemetery association, when it sells a burial lot and establishes a net sales price after selling expenses, must first deduct 10% and 15% for the maintenance funds, and only then, after these subtractions, may it pay plaintiff 50% of the remaining balance. The result is that plaintiff collects not half of the whole net price of the burial lot, but half of 75% thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Legislature intended the new rule to be applied to existing contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The 1949 amendments are constitutional as to plaintiff.  Funds derived from the sale of cemetery lots are dedicated to a public use and held in trust therefor and their disposal is subject to statutory regulation under the State's police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiff was on notice when it made its contract under the 1909 statute then in effect that the actual size of its 50% share of the proceeds of lot sales would depend on what amounts were first deducted before the &quot;proceeds&quot; became available, and that the Legislature which had asserted its right to regulate such agreements might reduce the &quot;proceeds&quot; by giving priority to additional expenditures required in the public interest. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent commissioner sought review of the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) that annulled his decision to deny an application by petitioner trucking corporation for public cart licenses and remanded the proceeding to respondent to reconsider the application.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner trucking corporation filed an application for public cart licenses for its five trucks, pursuant to the Administrative Code of the City of New York, &sect; B32-93.0 art. 15, which made it unlawful for any person to operate or cause the operation of any public cart without a license therefor. The application for the licenses was denied by respondent commissioner on the ground that petitioner was not a fit and proper party to be licensed to operate public carts. The trial court sustained respondent's order. The appeals court reversed finding that respondent had no power to withhold public cart licenses on the basis of general character and fitness of the applicant or for other arrogated qualifications in the absence of express statutory authority. The court reversed the judgment of the appeals court. The license was denied because a principal stockholder was found to be personally unfit having been convicted of extortion. As a result, the court found that there was substantial evidence in the record to support respondent's decision and his actions were not tantamount to an arbitrary or capricious abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Licenses -- public cart licenses -- Commissioner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> of Licenses of City of New York properly denied application by petitioner corporation, whose trucking services are carried on in garment industry, for public cart licenses (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; B32-93.0) upon finding that petitioner was not fit and proper party to be so licensed -- discretionary power to consider character of applicant implicitly delegated to Commissioner -- determination supported by evidence -- petitioner's treasurer had been convicted of extortion in connection with garment trucking racketeering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff, a domestic trucking corporation whose trucking services are carried on in New York City's garment industry, filed an application for public cart licenses for its five trucks pursuant to section B32-93.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York.  The application was denied by the Commissioner of Licenses of the City of New York upon a finding that petitioner was not a fit and proper party to be licensed to operate public carts, which finding was based on the fact that petitioner's treasurer had been convicted of extortion in 1937 in connection with garment trucking racketeering. An order of the court at Special Term which dismissed the petition for an order annulling the determination of the Commissioner and was reversed by the Appellate Division is reinstated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Any discretionary powers exercised by an administrative officer must be delegated to him by statute and such delegation must be accompanied by standards to guide the exercise of administrative discretion.  With respect to licensing officials, the power to withhold a license for good cause, as well as the standards defining good cause, need not be expressly delegated where, by fair implication, in the light of the statutory purpose, such power has been implicitly delegated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The discretionary power of the Commissioner to consider the character of an applicant for a cartman's license has been implicitly delegated to him.  All the relevant case law in this State expressly or impliedly holds that the licensing official has implicit discretion to pass upon the fitness of the applicant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The determination is supported by the evidence.  The conviction was for the crime of extortion, a felony.  The licensing ordinance regulates the rates chargeable by public cartmen for the apparent purpose of preventing price gouging and related abuses, and hence is specifically directed against a class of offenses comprehending extortion. Moreover, the conviction was not for criminal activities remote from the licensed business but was linked to the very industry in which petitioner seeks licenses to pursue its calling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The ordinance in question was designed to license the individual cartmen and is not merely concerned with the registration of property.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer was a New Jersey Corporation engaged in the transportation of passengers by omnibus and had no routes in the state except as part of an interstate carriage. The taxpayer paid taxes and penalties imposed by the commissioner under N.Y. Tax Laws &sect; 186-a and then sought a refund of the amount paid. The taxpayer argued that the tax violated the commerce clause of the United States Constitution because it was imposed for the privilege of doing business within the state. The trial court agreed with the commissioner that the statute did not violate the commerce clause and denied taxpayer's application. The court affirmed the denial of taxpayer's application for a refund. The court concluded that although the statute was incorporated for convenience into N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 186-a, the purpose of the omnibus tax was to require interstate carriers to make some contribution to the maintenance of the highways that they are using. The court found that the imposition of the tax in the same section under which domestic carriers were taxed demonstrated the absence of any intention to discriminate against interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An interstate omnibus carrier, to whose rights and obligations petitioner has succeeded through a merger, was a New Jersey corporation engaged in the transportation of passengers by omnibus and had no routes in this State except as part of an interstate carriage.  A tax was imposed on the company for the period from July 1 through November 30, 1951 under section 186-a of the Tax Law. That statute imposes an appropriate tax on interstate omnibus carriers to compensate New York for the use of its highways. It does not levy a tax upon them for the privilege of continuing to engage in business.  No basis exists for the claim that the tax is repugnant to the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was the target of investigation when he was subpoenaed by the grand jury, sworn as a witness, and compelled to give self-incriminating testimony. As the result of that testimony, an indictment was filed against defendant. Defendant then filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, asserting that his constitutional rights were violated. The trial court granted defendant's motion, and the state appealed. The court held that by virtue of the N.Y. Const. art, I, &sect; 6, a prospective defendant or one who was the target of an investigation could not be called and examined before a grand jury, and if he or she was, his or her constitutionally-conferred privileged against self incrimination was deemed violated even though he or she did not claim or assert the privilege. Further, an automatic result of the violation of that privilege was that any defendant was protected not only from indictment based on any incriminating testimony, which he or she may have given, but also from the use of the evidence. Accordingly, the order appealed from was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, a taxpayer, resident, and voter in the county, challenged the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which reversed the supreme court's order to declare a resolution of respondent, the county board of elections, null and void. Although the chairman of the Democratic Committee had not recommended a commissioner of elections, the board had appointed one.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Four times, the county chairman of the Democratic Committee recommended himself as a commissioner of elections. Four times, the county's board of supervisors refused to appoint him. State law required the chairman to submit names of potential candidates. Although the chairman had not submitted the name of anyone other than himself, the board appointed an enrolled Democrat as the new commissioner. A third Democrat in the county filed for an injunction against the Republican Commissioner of Elections, argued that the board had no legal existence, and filed a petition for mandamus to declare the board's action null and void. The supreme court granted the petition; but the appellate court reversed. The court cited the appellate court's decision, which addressed the merits and stated that the appellate court had exercised its discretion to strike the mandamus order. The court agreed that the consequences of holding the appointment invalid would undermine the board's service to the public and disenfranchise county voters. Because the court affirmed on the appellate court's exercise of discretion, it did not decide whether the appellate court's holdings on the law were correct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the appellate court's exercise of discretion when it held that the public interest would be damaged by allowing the supreme court to declare the board's action null and void. The court declined to consider whether the appellate court had ruled correctly on whether the board was required to appoint only candidates certified by the Democratic party.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against body or officer -- mandamus -- Appellate Division dismissed, in exercise of discretion, proceeding for order directing Board of Supervisors to revoke appointment of Commissioner of Elections and to desist from appointing person to Board of Elections as representing Democratic party unless certified by County Democratic Committee -- order of Appellate Division did not constitute abuse of discretion -- question whether dismissal upon law was correct not reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Appellate Division dismissed a proceeding brought by petitioner against the Board of Supervisors of Suffolk County for an order directing the board to revoke an appointment of a Commissioner of Elections for the county, and directing the board to desist from appointing any person to the Board of Elections as representing the Democratic party of that county unless such person had been duly certified and recommended by the Chairman of the Suffolk County Democratic Committee.  In dismissing the proceeding, the Appellate Division indicated that it was exercising the court's discretion because of the damage to the public interest which might result from a mandamus order, and also because the record does not fully set forth all the facts that might be pertinent to a determination of the question whether it would be possible for the Supervisors to appoint an Election Commissioner not recommended by the County Chairman.  The Appellate Division's order did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the reversal of the order at Special Term and dismissal in the exercise of discretion were proper, the question whether the determination insofar as it was on the law is correct is not reached.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York) affirmed the dismissal of third-party plaintiff ship owner's third-party complaint against third-party defendant employer in plaintiff stevedore's negligence action against the ship owner. The ship owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stevedore filed a negligence action against the ship owner and the ship owner filed a third-party complaint against the stevedore's employer for indemnity. The trial court dismissed the third-party complaint and the appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that &sect; 5 of the Longshoreman's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, codified at 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 905, did not preclude the indemnity suit. The court found that an indemnity action based on a passive-active negligence theory would have been foreclosed. However, the court found that the ship owner had pleaded an actual contract between itself and the employer, wherein the employer warranted that it would perform its engagement to load the ship in a safe and seamanlike manner. Because the indemnity suit was based on a contract theory, it was not precluded by &sect; 905.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order dismissing the ship owner's third-party complaint and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action in negligence by a stevedore against the operator of the ship upon which he was working when injured, the third-party complaint of the ship operator against the stevedore's employer should not have been dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 5 of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (U. S. Code, tit. 33, &sect; 905) provides that the liability of an employer &quot;shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee * * * and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury&quot;.  Maritime law applies and Federal law is controlling.  Under the Federal law, an independent contractual assumption of indemnity by the employer is regarded as a voluntary waiver of the limited liability afforded employers under the statute, whereas recovery over on the quasi-contractual theory of indemnity involving the distinction between active and passive negligence is considered to be precluded by the statute as a recovery &quot;on account of&quot; the injury.  Third-party plaintiff pleads the existence of a contract with and a warranty by third-party defendant to perform its engagement to load the ship in a safe and workmanlike manner.  Accordingly, the third-party complaint is sufficient in law and third-party plaintiff is entitled to a trial of its claim of indemnity against third-party defendant.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Department of Welfare (department) sought review of a judgment from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which reversed the domestic relations court's judgment that directed respondent stepmother, pursuant to the Domestic Relations Court Act (Act) of the city of New York, to pay for expenses incurred by the city because of the maintenance of a stepson, who was a public charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stepson of the stepmother was adjudicated delinquent, but the stepson's father was unable to furnish all the support payments. Consequently, the department initiated an action in the domestic relations court, claiming the stepmother was obligated under the Act to help pay for expenses incurred by the city because of the stepson's maintenance. After the domestic relations court ordered the stepmother to make payments, the court of appeals reversed, and the department sought review. In reversing, the court held that under &sect; 101 of the Act, the stepmother had become potentially liable for the payments because the stepson had been likely to become a public charge and the stepmother had known of the stepson's existence at the time of the stepmother's marriage. The court also held that because the father had been incapable of making the payments, the stepmother's liability had come into existence. Finally, the court held that &sect; 101 had not enumerated the order in which other persons, such as the mother and the grandparents, had become liable and instead, found that a fair reading of &sect; 101 had made everyone secondarily liable when the father failed to make the payments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In reversing a judgment from the court of appeals, the court upheld a judgment from the domestic relations court that directed the stepmother, pursuant to the Act, to pay for expenses incurred by the city because of the maintenance of a stepson, who was a public charge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

Section 101 of the Domestic Relations Court Act of the City of New York provides who shall be legally liable for support and includes a provision that &quot;The step parent of a child is hereby declared legally chargeable with the support of a step child likely to become a public charge provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that such step parent had knowledge of the child's existence at the time of said step parent's marriage.&quot; The two conditions for liability of a stepparent being present here, the order directing the stepmother to contribute to the support of the child was properly made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners owned a house and lot. The house was not taken, but 30 feet were appropriated by the state for the New York State Thruway along one side of the lot. After appropriation, the house was 5 feet instead of 35 feet from the sideline. There was no dispute as to the value of the property appropriated, but the property owners sought interest from the time of the appropriation rather than the date of the filing of their claim or from the taking of possession for Thruway purposes. The trial court found in favor of the property owners. The appellate court reversed and dismissed their claim to interest. On review, the court affirmed. The court agreed with the appellate court's view of the case, which stated that if nothing occurred to bring home knowledge of the taking to the property owners, they had the full use and benefit of the land during the interval and reasonably could not expect both interest and possession. The court held that a claimant could not attack the constitutionality of N.Y. Ct. Cl. Act &sect; 19(1) by contending that he should have been awarded interest to compensate him for a use of which he did not know that he had been deprived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) reversed, on the law, a judgment entered by the trial court granting a motion by defendant public employer to dismiss the complaint by plaintiff employees. The appellate division denied the motion. The question was certified: Was the order proper in denying the motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state facts sufficiently to constitute a cause of action?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer, as a board of higher education of a city, discharged the employees during an investigation of Communist membership. The employees, during the investigation, claimed their privilege against self incrimination when asked questions about Communist party membership. The employees contended that their refusal to answer questions was the only reason for their dismissal. The employees contended that they were denied due process and that they were dismissed without a hearing, in violation of the statutory rights attendant upon their tenure of service. The court found that the appellate division should not have denied the employees' motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. It did not matter whether the employer had exercised discretion in the dismissal. What mattered was that the employees' right to salary from the date of dismissal could more properly be determined in an article 78 proceeding. The court noted that the legislative intent was to relegate discharged employees to article 78 proceedings, without regard to whether the removal involved an exercise of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Certain teachers employed by the Board of Education and various members of the teaching staff of the Board of Higher Education, including plaintiffs herein, were dismissed from their positions after they had claimed their Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination in their appearances before the Internal Security Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary of the United States Senate.  Eight of those persons removed by the Board of Education commenced a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act seeking their reinstatement. Six former members of the instructional staff of the Board of Higher Education instituted a similar proceeding.  Plaintiffs herein were not among the petitioners in either of those proceedings.  Special Term dismissed the petitions in both of those proceedings and, during the pendency of appeals by the petitioners therein, plaintiffs herein entered into a stipulation with defendant Board of Higher Education. The stipulation bore the title of the Shlakman proceeding and provided that plaintiffs herein &quot;shall for all purposes be considered as parties to this [Shlakman] proceeding to the end that the final order or judgment made herein shall apply to and benefit or bind them, as the case may be, with the same force and effect as though they were formal parties petitioner herein.&quot; The attorney representing plaintiffs at the time they signed the stipulation originally represented all of the petitioners in the Shlakman proceeding.  After Special Term had dismissed the petition, Harry Slochower, one of the petitioners in the Shlakman proceeding, retained other counsel to represent him upon appeal.  The Appellate Division affirmed Special Term, as did also the Court of Appeals.  The Supreme Court dismissed the appeals of all of the petitioners, except Slochower, for want of a properly presented Federal question and thereafter held that Slochower's removal had been in violation of his constitutional rights. Slochower was eventually reinstated with back salary. After Special Term had entered the order directing Slochower's reinstatement, plaintiffs moved for an order to include within the terms of the order reinstating Slochower a provision &quot;to the end that the determination of the Board of Higher Education terminating the employment of each of them be annulled&quot; or a determination that the stipulation constituted a waiver of the four-month limitation provided for by section 1286 of the Civil Practice Act for the commencement of an article 78 proceeding.  Special Term determined that an identical, uniform result affecting all of the Shlakman petitioners, rather than one result affecting one petitioner (Slochower) and another result affecting the other petitioners, was made a condition precedent to the entry of a final order to benefit or bind the stipulants and that, the condition having failed, no rights under the stipulation accrued in favor of either of the parties thereto.  The court also stated that there was nothing to justify a finding that the limitation provided by section 1286 of the Civil Practice Act was waived.  No appeal was taken from that order of Special Term.  In the present action at law in which plaintiffs, six discharged members of the instructional staff of defendant, the Board of Higher Education of the City of New York, who have not been reinstated to their positions, seek to recover damages allegedly resulting from their dismissal, the complaint was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The right to a position determines the right to the salary incident thereto.  A discharged public employee must prove his right to the position in a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act. An action to recover the salary may not be brought until plaintiffs have been reinstated in such a proceeding.  The article 78 proceeding must be undertaken in those cases where the discharging body or officer has exercised no discretion as well as in those cases where the discharging body or officer has exercised discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the present case plaintiffs never sought reinstatement through an article 78 proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a trial court verdict that found him guilty of conspiracy, illegal possession of wiretap equipment, and aiding and employing others to wire tap illegally and using rooms and apparatus for illegal wire tapping in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1423.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant maintained that the offenses were not &quot;willful&quot; as used in &sect; 1423 and that the state statute was preempted by &sect; 605 of the Federal Communications Act (Act), thus barring his state prosecution. The court affirmed his conviction and held that the Act was not intended to displace the state's ability to make wire tapping illegal. The Act made illegal the interception of communication and the divulging of that communication. The mere act of wire tapping was not illegal under the Act. The state statute specifically made the act of wire tapping illegal and therefore was not in conflict with the federal statute. Reviewing the facts under the three criteria of Nelson, the court found that the Act was not intended to occupy the field of wire tapping, that the field of wire tapping was not so affected with a federal interest that state regulation was assumed to be precluded, and that enforcement of the state statute did not present a serious conflict the administration of the federal statute. Defendant's argument that &quot;willful&quot; meant &quot;wantonly and maliciously&quot; was without merit because the construction of the statute evidenced that it did not contain the element of malice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- wire tapping -- defendant convicted of violation of section 1423 (subd. 6) of Penal Law which forbids unlawful and willful wire tapping -- charge that willful does not mean that person's act was motivated by spite, malice or hate, but means &quot;intentionally&quot; and &quot;knowing that the act is being done&quot; was correct -- &quot;willfully&quot; does not mean wantonly and maliciously as differentiated from intentionally or knowingly -- prohibition</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> against wire tapping contained in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (Penal Law, &sect; 1423, subd. 6) not pre-empted by Federal Communications Act ( &sect; 605) -- State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> does not impinge on Federal constitutional jurisdiction under commerce clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 6 of section 1423 of the Penal Law provided that it should be a felony to &quot;unlawfully and willfully cut, break, tap or make connection with any telegraph or telephone line, wire, cable or instrument, or read or copy in any unauthorized manner any message, communication or report passing over it, in this state&quot;.  The trial court charged the jury that willful does not mean &quot;that a person does an act motivated by feelings of spite, malice or hate.  It merely means intentionally doing an act and knowing that the act is being done&quot;.  The charge was correct.  The word &quot;willfully&quot; does not mean wantonly and maliciously as differentiated from intentionally or knowingly.  The prohibition against wire tapping was primarily designed to protect the privacy of telephone conversations and, accordingly, the word &quot;wilfully&quot; would refer to an act consciously and deliberately done and would not include the element of malice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The prohibition against wire tapping contained in section 1423 (subd. 6) of the Penal Law was not pre-empted by section 605 of the Federal Communications Act which is entitled &quot;Unauthorized publication or use of communications&quot; and provides in part that &quot;no person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted communication to any person&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The State's penal provision against wire tapping does not impinge on Federal constitutional jurisdiction under the commerce clause.  It is not an attempted regulation of telephonic communications, but a local police measure designed to protect the people of this State against unwarranted intrusions into their privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Federal act seems to require both an interception and a divulgence or publication of &quot;the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted communication&quot;, and does not appear on its face to prohibit wire tapping as such.  If the Federal statute does not make criminal the act of wire tapping, then there would appear to be no impingement on Federal criminal jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Assuming, however, that section 1423 (subd. 6) of the Penal Law does impinge on Federal jurisdiction, the State statute is not invalid since the Federal statutory provision was not intended to supersede the State statute.  The States have not been pre-empted from punishing wire tapping. Congress intended to leave room for a State to punish the tapping of telephones within its borders.  The State statute does not offend the supremacy clause of the Federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. As to certain of the alleged errors in the court's charge, and allegedly prejudicial remarks made by the prosecutor in his summation, no ruling was preserved to review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The charge as a whole was clear and thorough and provided the jury with a comprehensive summary of the evidence, the issues involved and the applicable legal principles.  The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion for mistrial because of a remark by the prosecutor: &quot;How does he [defense attorney] know what I know, or I don't know?&quot;.  The prosecutor's remark was uncalled for but the jury was told to disregard it, and it lacks the prejudicial meaning ascribed to it by defendant and the trial court also cautioned the jury that &quot;any suggestions * * * conveyed to your mind of things not in evidence * * * should be resolutely removed from any consideration by you&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The prosecutor also stated that &quot;I am the fellow you should convict if I deliberately permitted that man [Ruh] to commit perjury, knowing it in my heart and soul?&quot;.  The prompt and complete instructions of the trial court prevented the improper remark from having any serious consequence, and the court did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion made for a mistrial because of that remark.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The hospital owner brought an action to compel the board of hospitals (board) to issue to him a license permitting him to operate a private proprietary hospital. The application was denied because the hospital owner had not complied with the city hospital regulations. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's denial of the hospital owner's application to review and annul the determination of the board. On further review, the court affirmed the order. The hospital owner argued that as those regulations did not equally apply to municipal hospitals and voluntary nonprofit hospitals, as well as private proprietary hospitals, there was unreasonable discrimination. Private proprietary hospitals were in a separate class because they were not subjected to close scrutiny by either the city or state. Under the regulations, all private proprietary hospitals were treated alike, therefore, the equal protection argument failed. The hospital owner contended that the new code constituted an unlawful taking. The hospital owner did not acquire immunity against the exercise of police power because he constructed it in full compliance with existing laws. The regulations were not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The regulations changed the required minimum floor area per bed and also required an increase in the nursing staff for such hospitals.  These new regulations do not constitute an unreasonable discrimination and do not violate the due process provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions (U. S. Const., 14th Amdt.; N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 6).  The fact that the regulations do not apply equally to municipal hospitals and voluntary nonprofit hospitals is not an unreasonable discrimination. The Legislature itself has established private proprietary hospitals in New York City in a separate class and has subjected them to special rules and regulations by the Board of Hospitals.  The other institutions come under the close scrutiny of either the city or the State.  Private hospitals, without regulation, do not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Under the regulations, all private proprietary hospitals are treated alike.  Equal protection is accomplished when all of the same class are treated in a like manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Moreover, it is not shown whether there are any similar regulations in other statutes or rules applicable to city hospitals or voluntary hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The new hospital code, which reduces the bed capacity of the hospital, does not constitute an unlawful taking in violation of due process of law because the hospital had been conducted in compliance with the regulations in the superseded hospital code.  Compliance with existing laws does not prevent the exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The minimum space requirements are not unreasonable as a matter of law and the Board of Hospitals did not act in an arbitrary manner in refusing a license to petitioner under the regulations. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patrolman was suspended after being named as the finger-man in a series of payroll holdups by two members of an alleged holdup gang. Two sets of charges were filed against the patrolman. The first set accused him of guarding various payrolls and alleged four violations of the police department's rules and regulations. The second set of charges accused him of supplying information to the holdup gang and receiving a share of the proceeds of the robberies. The patrolman pleaded not guilty to both sets of charges. The patrolman refused to participate in his trial. The Commissioner determined that the patrolman knowingly and wilfully disobeyed an order by the trial Commissioner in failing to attend the trial and found him guilty of insubordination. The court affirmed the decision finding guilty of the escort and holdup charges. The court annulled the Commissioner's determination that the patrolman was guilty of insubordination. When the Commissioner ordered the patrolman to proceed to trial, he was not acting in the capacity of the patrolman's superior officer within the meaning and intent of the department rules.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, a patrolman in the New York City Police Department, was suspended on April 28, 1956.  On May 1 and 3, 1956 two sets of charges were filed against him.  The first set contained 13 specifications. Violations of Department Rules and Regulations were alleged with respect to the escort of each of three named persons and the second set of charges contained specifications alleging various acts of supplying information to a holdup gang and receipt of a share of the proceeds of certain of the robberies. A hearing was scheduled for June 4.  On that date the Corporation Counsel requested an adjournment so that he might serve a requested bill of particulars.  The Corporation Counsel did not serve the bill of particulars on the escort charges until the adjourned date of June 27.  The Commissioner denied a further adjournment and petitioner refused to participate in the trial on June 27.  His refusal was made the subject of a third set of charges -- knowingly and willfully disobeying an order by the Trial Commissioner.  On July 6 petitioner pleaded not guilty to the new charge and it and the escort charges were set down for trial for July 11.  On the adjourned date, petitioner refused to participate in the hearing and the Commissioner proceeded to take testimony on the insubordination and escort charges.  Petitioner was thereafter found guilty and dismissed.  No hearing was ever had on the criminal charges nor were the charges dismissed and no prosecution was ever instituted against petitioner.  Since the insubordination charge may not be sustained, the matter is remitted to respondent Commissioner of Police for a redetermination of the measure of punishment with respect to the charges which have not been annulled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner's refusal to obey the order to proceed to trial on June 27 could not be made the basis of an insubordination charge.  The order to proceed to trial under the circumstances constituted an abuse of discretion.  He was entitled to an adjournment since the bill of particulars was not served until the morning of June 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Moreover, when the Trial Commissioner ordered petitioner to proceed to trial, he was not acting in the capacity of petitioner's superior officer within the meaning and intent of the department rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There is substantial evidence to support the finding of guilt on the various specifications in the escort charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The refusal to grant an adjournment beyond July 11 was not an abuse of discretion. Petitioner's attorney offered no valid reason why he had been unable to conduct the necessary investigation preparatory to trial nor why such investigation could not have been completed prior to the trial date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The Commissioner had power to try petitioner in his absence after his refusal to participate in the trial under the circumstances here presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Since petitioner had applied for retirement to take effect on August 2, the Trial Commissioner could take into account petitioner's apparent attempt to render the trial futile insofar as his pension was concerned.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff is a Massachusetts corporation with its principal business and executive office in Providence, R. I., authorized to do business in New York State and engaged in manufacturing textile fabrics and curtains in factories outside this State.  One of plaintiff's out-of-State offices arranges for the purchase of cotton in the South, then has the cotton shipped to plaintiff's factories in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Vermont from which plaintiff ships out to its customers in various States greige goods (unbleached fabrics) and curtains and curtain materials.  Some of the unbleached fabrics are sent for refinishing by plaintiff to dyeing plants owned by others, where the greige goods are dyed or printed as required by accepted orders from plaintiff's customers. In New York City plaintiff has two separate offices.  The New York offices employ altogether about 90 people (out of its total force of 8,500 people) of whom 20 are salesmen. In addition to its 20 salesmen working in New York City, plaintiff has other salesmen in other parts of the United States.  Plaintiff has no factory, warehouse or store in New York State, keeps no stock of goods in this State and owns no property here except the furnishings of its New York City offices.  The functions of plaintiff's New York City offices and staff are to maintain contact with the trade by soliciting established and prospective accounts; to receive and to reject, modify or accept offers to buy; to forward accepted offers to one of plaintiff's plants or warehouses outside the State of New York to be filled; to perform credit investigations and functions; to make up and dispatch invoices of sales of finished goods, but not of greige goods or curtains; and to receive and deposit payments from customers. Plaintiff's activities in the City or State of New York do not consist of the negotiation of interstate sales only.  The record shows activities going much beyond the negotiating of sales.  The Appellate Division was correct in holding that the imposition on plaintiff of the New York City General Business and Financial Tax (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; B46-2.0, subd. a; see enabling act, General City Law, &sect; 24-a) did not violate the Interstate Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A local privilege tax like that of New York City may not be imposed upon interstate sales or solicitations by an interstate business. However, the local authorities may validly tax the privilege of doing business locally if the local business operations, though related to interstate movements of goods, extend substantially beyond the sale and promotion of the products and include a local incident which is sufficient to bring the transaction within its taxing power. The local New York City activities of the present plaintiff include a substantial measure of control by plaintiff's officials in New York City of production, contracting, shipment and credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 22 of article III of the New York State Constitution, cited by plaintiff in support of an argument that the statute imposing this tax is unconstitutionally vague and represents an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, does not apply to local taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Other charges of unconstitutional vagueness and delegation of power have been rejected by this court as to this same tax and these questions are no longer open in this court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Plaintiff's attack on the amount of the tax and the correctness of the formula for arriving at it cannot be litigated in a plenary suit like the present one.  The sole remedy for relief from incorrectness of the allocation formula or the application thereof is a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Water Pollution Control Law (L. 1949, ch. 666; Public Health Law, art. 12, &sect;&sect; 1200-1263), designed to prevent pollution of the waters of the State, created the Water Pollution Control Board.  Acting under the authority of the statute, the Board held public hearings and adopted classifications and standards of quality and purity, and later, following extensive studies and surveys and after further public hearings, it assigned classifications and standards of quality and purity to the waters within the area of the City of Utica.  When the City failed to abate the pollution caused by its discharging of untreated sewage into the Mohawk River and the Barge Canal, the Board brought a proceeding against the City charging it with violation of section 1220 of the Public Health Law. In the present proceeding by the City to restrain the Board from continuing with the hearing of charges against it, the petition was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Water Pollution Control Law does not constitute an invalid delegation of legislative authority and is not unconstitutional.  It is not a grant of power without adequate standards for the Board's guidance in violation of the State Constitution (art. III, &sect; 1).  The problems involved in water pollution control varied considerably throughout the State, and the solution had to be approached generally.  In view of the breadth of the problem of water pollution control, and its technical and intricate character, the Legislature could not have been more specific in prescribing essential guides.  To require more precise standards than furnished by this statute would mean that the Legislature's power to control pollution could not be effectively exercised.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, town and village, challenged a determination by respondent water control board regarding the classification of certain waters in a river. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) affirmed the board's decision. The town and village appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The water control board (board) classified certain waters within the town and village into a classification that might require appellants to cease their longstanding practice of discharging sewage into the river without any kind of treatment, and require construction of sewage treatment facilities. Appellants claimed that the board had failed to follow its statutory duty in deciding whether a particular classification was in the public interest by failing to consider the economic and fiscal impact of the classification upon the municipalities affected, and failed to accord proper notice and hearing to allow them to cross-examine the evidence or reports considered by the board in making its determination. The lower court's confirmation of the board's decision was affirmed because the court found that problems of municipal financing were not among the considerations contemplated in N.Y. Pub. Health Law. &sect; 1209 subd. 3. The court further determined that the hearing held by the board comported with the requirements of the law because it was conducted upon due notice as required by statute, and no specific format for the hearing was required.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- water pollution control -- in applying classification to waters of section of Mohawk River which may require town and village to construct sewage treatment facilities at great expense, Water Pollution Control Board was not required to take into account economic and fiscal impact of classification upon municipalities affected -- when Board evolves program to abate pollution in classified waters, municipality may apply for extension of time if financially</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> unable to comply -- informal hearing conducted by Board before classification was proper -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> providing for hearing (Public Health Law, &sect; 1209, subd. 6) did not require that witnesses be sworn, testimony be taken, opportunity for cross-examination be given and findings of fact made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Water Pollution Control Board classified the waters of that section of the Mohawk River Drainage Basin extending from its mouth to the first dam above Cohoes Falls as &quot;Class C&quot; waters. Class C waters require sewage treatment and, as a result of such classification, the Town of Waterford and Village of Waterford, who for a long period had been discharging sewage into the river without any kind of treatment, may be required to cease such practice and eventually to construct sewage treatment facilities at great expense to the town and village.  In applying its classification system to particular waters the Board was not required to take into account the economic and fiscal impact of the classification upon the municipalities affected.  Problems of municipal financing need not be considered by the Board in classifying particular waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Act does recognize (Public Health Law, &sect; 1224)  that financial disability might impede the construction of the facilities needed to comply with the adopted classifications. The relief provided, however, is, not the annulment of the classification, but an extension of time in which to effect the needed improvements.  The time to raise the question of the fiscal and economic aspects of water purification is not at the time of classification. It is when the Board, in accordance with its previously assigned classifications, evolves a comprehensive program to abate pollution in the classified waters. If, at that time, a municipality demonstrates it is financially unable to provide the treatment works necessary to cure the pollution, the Board is empowered to grant extensions of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Subdivision 6 of section 1209 of the Public Health Law provides that &quot;The adoption, alteration or modification of a classification of the waters of the state or the standards of quality and purity, above prescribed, shall be made by the board only after public hearing on due notice.&quot; The statute requiring a public hearing (&sect; 1209, subd. 6) does not prescribe the form or manner in which it is to be conducted, and it did not require that witnesses be sworn, testimony be taken, opportunity for cross-examination be given and findings of fact made.  The hearing as conducted by the Board accorded with the type of hearing contemplated by the Legislature.  In making specific provision for a quasi-judicial type of hearing with respect to violations of the statute or orders of the Board (&sect; 1208, subd. 3, par. [b]), the Legislature impliedly sanctioned the informal type of hearing conducted here.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The public works sought to appropriate part of the charity's hospital to build a highway. The charity brought an action to restrain the taking, and filed a motion for an injunction pendente lite, arguing that 1927 N.Y. Laws chs. 653, 659, specifically prohibit the public works from building a highway on the land or taking the land for any use. The trial court denied the motion, found ch. 659 invalid, and granted the public works' motion to dismiss the charity's action. The appellate court modified the trial court's order so that the injunction pendente lite was granted and the motion to dismiss was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the public works was bound by ch. 659, which specifically forbade the condemnation of the charity's land. The court further held that ch. 659 was not invalidated by the subsequently enacted N.Y. High. Law &sect; 340(a), because &sect; 340(a) did not express a clear legislative intent to repeal 1927 N.Y.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 1 of chapter 659 of the Laws of 1927 provides that no street or avenue or road shall be laid out or opened through or upon any of certain described lands and premises in the City of White Plains and none of said land shall be taken for any use whenever and so long as it shall be owned or occupied for hospital purposes by the Society of the New York Hospital, provided, however, that the Society of the New York Hospital shall dedicate for street purposes certain other described parcels of land, and shall, in addition thereto, provide $ 150,000 for the paving and regulating of the street described in those parcels.  Chapter 653 of the Laws of 1927, passed and signed by the Governor at the same time, amended the Charter of the City of White Plains to provide that &quot;It shall be unlawful to open any streets through the grounds belonging to the society of the New York hospital * * * as long as the same is owned or occupied for hospital purposes.&quot; Plaintiff conveyed the real property to the city as required by chapter 659 and paid over the $ 150,000.  The Superintendent of Public Works is authorized by sections 30 and 340-b of the Highway Law to appropriate lands for arterial highways by eminent domain, including those which will make an interstate connection between the New England Thruway and the New York State Thruway.  Section 340-a of the Highway Law authorizes the location of one of those interstate routes as &quot;passing through or northerly of White Plains&quot;.  To carry out these purposes the Superintendent may not appropriate a strip of plaintiff's land presently vacant but used for hospital purposes.  The State has the right to terminate the exemption from appropriation but it has not done so.  The statutes passed after 1927 authorizing the Superintendent to acquire lands anywhere in the State for highway purposes and especially to make such acquisitions for a route &quot;passing through or northerly of White Plains&quot; did not discontinue plaintiff's exemption. The Legislature's positive direction not to take described lands should be cancelled only by a plain command or permission to appropriate.  Their repeal or abrogation should be evidenced by clear legislative language, and such language is not found in any statute.  </SPAN></P>

The primary purpose for such a condition was to remedy practical difficulties in the administration of elections insofar as independent nominating petitions were concerned. The franchise conferred by N.Y.

On appeal, the court affirmed because the statutory provisions were constitutional and the Board's resolution was final. The only question for decision was whether a county-established college could be regarded as an institution operated for a proper &quot;county purpose&quot; within the sense of N.Y. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 126 of the Education Law provides for the establishment and financing of two-year community colleges (Education Law, &sect;&sect; 6301-6307).

The County of Rensselaer established the Hudson Valley Technical Institute as a community college and the Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution authorizing the acquisition of real property and the construction and equipment of buildings thereon.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court affirmed. It found that the taxpayer was a domestic corporation that sold beer to distributors and others. Some of its distributors sold its beer to interstate clients. But, the taxpayer delivered all of the beer intrastate. The taxpayer reported its sales to out-of-state distributors as receipts from interstate commerce and based the required city business tax solely on revenue derived from sales to those of its customers doing business in the city. But, the transactions between the taxpayer and its distributors, which constituted the taxable event, were local and distinct from the transportation by the distributors that constituted interstate commerce. These transactions conducted within the taxpayer's city were local transactions that were taxable by the city, and neither the Commerce Clause nor the Fourteenth Amendment prevented the imposition of the city's tax on such receipts even though the total activities from which the local transaction derived had incidental interstate attributes. The validity of a tax, or of the statute imposing one, depended on substance, not labels. The city comptroller accurately assessed the taxpayer for deficiencies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order confirming the determination against the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- intrastate commerce -- tax imposed on gross receipts for privilege of carrying on business within city of New York (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; B46-2.0, subd. a) properly imposed on sales made by petitioner corporation to out-of-state distributors -- deliveries made to said distributors in New York City -- petitioner assumed no responsibility for beer from time it was loaded on distributors' trucks -- transaction is local and taxable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City of New York taxed receipts from sales by petitioner, a domestic corporation, made to out-of-state distributors. The customer's truck would be loaded at petitioner's brewery in Brooklyn and, after the load had been checked by the driver and one of petitioner's employees, the truck would be &quot;sealed&quot; and driven to the distributor's place of business. Some distributors own their own trucks or lease them while others use contract motor carriers or motor vehicle common carriers. The trucker taking delivery of the beer was selected by the distributor and had no connection with the brewery. No employee or representative of petitioner handled the beer or accompanied it once it left the brewery and it assumed no responsibility for the beer from that time on.  On its New York City business tax return -- a tax imposed on gross receipts for &quot;the privilege of carrying on * * * business&quot; within the city (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; B46-2.0, subd. a) -- petitioner reported its sales to out-of-state distributors as receipts from interstate commerce. Respondent comptroller ruled that, since the customer took delivery in the city, the transaction was local and intrastate and the moneys received were taxable and, following hearings, he decided that the tax should be imposed upon all receipts, including those from sales to distributors doing business in other states except where delivery for the out-of-state customer was made to a common carrier. The Appellate Division properly confirmed this determination.  A sale of goods in which delivery is taken by the purchaser within the seller's state is a local transaction which is taxable.  It is immaterial that the goods are to be transported out of the taxing state immediately on delivery. </SPAN></P>

The wife filed an action for divorce, for custody and support of their child, and for spousal support in Vermont.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, then a resident of New York, and defendant, a resident of Vermont, were married in Connecticut on September 26, 1942.  In 1944 they established their matrimonial domicile in Vermont.  In June, 1951 defendant left plaintiff and took up residence in New Hampshire.  In 1952 he moved to Nevada where he obtained an ex parte divorce in July, 1952, which made no provision for the support of plaintiff or for the custody and support of their child.  On November 15, 1952 plaintiff commenced an action in Vermont seeking custody of the child.  While the action was pending, she moved to New York.  She stayed at the home of defendant's mother in New York from October, 1953 through July, 1955 when she purchased a home in New York.  She testified that in October, 1953 she formed the intention to become a resident of the State of New York.  A Vermont County Court, on March 20, 1954, awarded plaintiff custody of the daughter, ordered defendant to pay a stated sum monthly for the support of the child and for plaintiff's support, and to pay a stated sum for attorneys' fees and disbursements. The court also ruled that defendant's Nevada divorce decree was entitled to full faith and credit.  Upon appeal, the Vermont Supreme Court reversed so much of that determination as related to plaintiff's support, stating that the court did not have power to entertain a petition for support by a person who had been validly divorced in another jurisdiction.  Prior to the decision of the Vermont Supreme Court plaintiff instituted an action in the New York court against defendant husband seeking, in part, such relief as she might be entitled to under sections 1170-a and 1170-b of the Civil Practice Act. She later filed a supplemental complaint setting forth the decision of the Vermont Supreme Court and amended her complaint to allege her residence in this State for more than one year to comply with section 1170-b of the Civil Practice Act. The New York court properly refused to accord plaintiff the requested relief under section 1170-b of the Civil Practice Act. The Legislature, in enacting that statute, intended it to apply only to &quot;New York wives&quot; and not to a spouse who at no time during the course of her marriage was a &quot;New York wife&quot;.  The purpose was to afford a remedy to wives here whose property rights might be jeopardized by an ex parte divorce by their spouses. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant residents sought review on constitutional grounds of a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a trial court's judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The residents brought a taxpayer's action to declare 1955 N.Y. Laws 806-809 unconstitutional and to restrain the Mayor and Board of Estimate of the City of New York from acting thereunder in the condemnation of real property necessitated by the construction of a bridge by the Port Authority. The court did not address the constitutional issues. Rather, the court affirmed the judgments of the lower courts and held that the home rule amendment did not apply to the challenged laws. The court reasoned that the Port Authority was a state agency and the bridge, which was to tie into the interstate highway system, did not involve an issue of solely local concern. Accordingly, the enabling legislation for the bridge construction and related condemnation did not require a city message to be valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgments of the lower court, which granted the motion filed by the city board of estimate and the Port Authority to dismiss the residents' complaint and declared that the statutes at issue were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- Home Rule -- chapters 806-809 of Laws of 1955 providing for Throgs Neck bridge connecting Bronx and Queens and bridge over Narrows connecting Brooklyn and Staten Island and second deck to George Washington bridge between New York and New Jersey not invalid under Home Rule provisions of State Constitution (art. IX, &sect;&sect; 11, 12) -- Home Rule provisions not applicable -- Port Authority engaged in matters of State concern and matters over which Authority has jurisdiction are not within Home Rule provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapters 806-809 of the Laws of 1955 provide for the construction and operation of bridges over Throgs Neck connecting Bronx and Queens and over the Narrows connecting Brooklyn and Staten Island and for the construction of a second deck to the George Washington bridge between New York and New Jersey.  The statutes are not invalid under the Home Rule provisions of the State Constitution (art. IX, &sect;&sect; 11, 12).  The Home Rule amendment does not apply to any of chapters 806-809 of the Laws of 1955.  The Port Authority is engaged in matters of State concern and therefore the matters over which the Authority has jurisdiction are not within the Home Rule amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Narrows bridge terminates on Staten Island within the State of New York, but both chapters 807 and 808 require concurrent legislation by the State of New Jersey, and the plan calls for highway connections with bridges from Staten Island to New Jersey.  The Narrows bridge, like the second deck on the George Washington bridge, is of an interstate character and therefore properly within the jurisdiction of the Port Authority and it is a matter of State concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Throgs Neck bridge is authorized to be constructed by the Triborough Bridge &amp; Tunnel Authority and will be under the sole jurisdiction of that Authority.  Chapter 809 designates as among the existing or proposed main routes or thoroughfares the Cross-Bronx expressway from the George Washington bridge approach to Throgs Neck bridge, which indicates that the State of New York has adopted that portion of the national system of interstate highways which designates the Throgs Neck bridge as a continuation of the main route across the Hudson River over the George Washington bridge. This national system of interstate highways also contemplates traffic to and from New Jersey over the Throgs Neck bridge by way of the proposed Narrows bridge or one of the tunnels under the Hudson River.  The Throgs Neck bridge is thus linked with the George Washington bridge, and with other existing or contemplated routes to New Jersey.  All of these projects are joined together in chapters 806-809 of the Laws of 1955.  They are all part of an interstate project or projects and consequently are matters of State concern.  </SPAN></P>

However, cooperage owners applied for and received yearly business licenses for a preexisting non-conforming use. City adopted a new zoning ordinance in 1953 which required non-conforming uses to cease after three years. In 1956, city sent cooperage owners a notice to discontinue their business. Cooperage owners brought an article 78 proceeding for an order directing city to issue a wholesale junk license to them. The lower courts sustained cooperage owners. City appealed and argued that the ordinance was a valid exercise of police power.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the petitioners purchased certain real property in the city of Buffalo in 1924.  He erected a 30-foot by 40-foot-frame building thereon, and from that time has operated a cooperage business there.  In 1924 the land was unzoned.  Since 1926, except for the period between 1949 and 1953 when it was zoned for business, the land had been zoned for residential use, and it is presently in an &quot;R3&quot; dwelling district.  In 1936, under an ordinance which included the operations of petitioners in a definition of &quot;junk dealers&quot;, they applied for and received a license to carry on their business, and they have obtained licenses from then through the fiscal year 1956.  The effect of an amendment of the ordinances of the City of Buffalo, effective as of July 30, 1953, was that petitioners were required to cease their nonconforming use or change it to a conforming use within three years from the effective date of the amendment.  On November 27, 1956, the director of licenses of the City of Buffalo notified petitioners to discontinue the operation of their &quot;junk yard&quot; at once.  The Appellate Division modified an order of the court at Special Term which had ordered that petitioners' application for a wholesale junk license for the premises be accepted and that the license be issued, and which had enjoined the City of Buffalo from prohibiting their nonconforming use of the premises by striking out the provision for an injunction.  The order is reversed and the matter remanded to the court at Special Term for a trial of the material issues.  The value of the property together with the improvements is said to be $ 20,000, but there is no indication of the relative value of the land and improvements separately.  Petitioners claim that, at the insistence of the City of Buffalo, a few years before the ordinance went into effect, they were obliged to install a special sewage system at a cost of $ 2,000 and a boiler at a cost of $ 700.  Evidence should be adduced relating to the nature of the surrounding neighborhood, the value and condition of the improvements on the premises, the nearest area to which petitioners might relocate, and the cost of such relocation, as well as any other reasonable costs which bear upon the kind and amount of damages which petitioners might sustain, and to whether petitioners might be able to continue operation of their business if not allowed to continue storage of barrels or steel drums outside their frame building.  </SPAN></P>

Law &sect;&sect; 122, 122-a was constitutional because it furnished the licensor with a definite standard to apply, namely whether the motion picture portrayed acts of sexual immorality as proper behavior. It was undeniable that the board knew what an act of sexual immorality was and that adultery was such an act. The standard left no area of judgment or speculation open to the board. Their sole function under the statute was the fact-finding function as to whether a particular motion picture portrayed acts of sexual immorality as proper behavior. If it did, it was ipso facto immoral by statutory mandate. There was no need to consider whether the motion picture would perceptibly create a clear and present danger of antisocial conduct because obscenity was not protected speech.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owners challenged, on constitutional grounds, a judgment from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the summary judgment rendered by the trial court in favor of defendant city and intervenor religious university. After an urban renewal plan had been approved, the property owners sought to invalidate the plan and to enjoin the city from carrying it out.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As part of an urban renewal plan, the religious university purchased a parcel of land at a price lower than the price paid by the city through condemnation. The property owners brought an action to invalidate the plan and to enjoin the city from carrying it out. The property owners argued that the sale to the university was an impermissible direct subsidy of public moneys to a denominational institution. The trial court denied the motion for a temporary injunction and granted the motion for summary judgment filed by the city and university. The appellate division affirmed. On further review, the court affirmed the dismissal of the action. The court held that the condemnation of the land and the sale to the university was not an unconstitutional grant or subsidy of public moneys to a religious corporation. The city and university paid for different things. The city bought land and buildings. The university bought the property to raze the buildings, relocate the tenants, and use the cleared land for a collegiate campus. The university paid for the re-use value of the land, and the city benefited by the achievement of its valid municipal purpose of eliminating a slum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the summary judgment for the city and the university in the property owners' action challenging the urban renewal plan. The court dismissed the property owner's appeal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. As part of the Lincoln Square Urban Renewal Project -- a slum clearance project in New York City -- each sponsor, such as intervenor Fordham University, agreed to bid at the auction provided for by section 72-k of the General Municipal Law, a stated minimum price and, if it should be the successful bidder, to relocate the prior occupants, clear its part of the site and redevelop that part as required by the plan, with buildings to be approved by the city.  Fordham University agreed to bid, for the two-block part set aside for &quot;educational purposes&quot;, at least $ 2,241,610, or $ 7 per square foot. The city on its part agreed to acquire that part (as well as the rest of the area) by condemnation, and, if Fordham University should be successful at the auction, to convey that part to the university at the auction price.  The resale of this area to Fordham University, a Roman Catholic institution, is not a grant of public moneys to a denominational institution in violation of section 7 of article I of the New York State Constitution and of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Both courts below have found that the $ 7 per square foot which Fordham agreed to bid, and did bid, is at least equal to the re-use value as established by several appraisals, all of which reported figures lower than $ 7 per square foot. Therefore, Fordham University is not getting a gift, grant or subsidy of public property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since this sale is an exchange of considerations and not a gift or subsidy, no &quot;aid to religion&quot; is involved.  A religious corporation cannot be excluded from the bidding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The system of selling these properties at auctions where there may be little likelihood of competing bids is not invalid.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Gross Receipts Tax -- receipts from literary activities -- Gross Receipts Tax (Administrative Code of City of New York, ch. 46, tit. B) properly imposed by City of New York upon petitioner, author of novels, plays, motion picture scripts, magazine articles and other literary works, who received income from licensing of such works -- his literary activities constitute &quot;trade, business, profession, vocation or commercial activity&quot;, within meaning of tax statute -- receipts taxable although attributable to contracts made in prior taxable years -- constitutional guarantee of freedom of press does not prohibit imposition of tax -- petitioner not engaged in interstate commerce although publisher</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> may be -- relationship between petitioner and publisher is that of debtor and creditor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A Gross Receipts Tax (Administrative Code of City of New York, ch. 46, tit. B) is imposed by the City of New York pursuant to section 24-a of the General City Law which authorizes the city to impose &quot;a tax * * * upon persons carrying on or exercising for gain or profit within such city, any trade, business, profession, vocation or commercial activity * * * or making sales within such city&quot;.  Petitioner, a resident of New York City, is an author of novels, plays, motion picture scripts, magazine articles and other literary works.  Through his literary agents located in New York City, he negotiated for the licensing of certain rights in his literary works.  The agents' principal function was to negotiate such contracts and they had complete authority and discretion in so doing, and had executed contracts on his behalf.  As to books, the consideration to be paid to petitioner consists of a percentage of the amount charged by the publisher for all copies sold, less copies returned, but with no deduction for cash discounts or bad debts.  This percentage is characterized as &quot;royalties.&quot; As to motion picture scripts, magazine and newspaper articles, and plays, the consideration consists of a lump sum or a percentage or a combination of the two.  Petitioner's activities in the city of New York constitute a &quot;trade, business, profession, vocation or commercial activity&quot; within the meaning of the tax statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner's receipts are taxable although the receipts in any one taxable calendar year may be attributable to contracts made in prior taxable years.  The tax is measured by the &quot;receipts received in and/or allocable to the city from such profession, vocation, trade, business or commercial activity exercised or carried on by him during the calendar year&quot; in which the privilege period commences (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; B46-2.0, subd. a).  The statute requires merely that the receipts be attributable to the profession, vocation, trade, business, or commercial activity which the petitioner carried on in that year and not to any &quot;particular activity&quot;.  The fact that the contract may have been made in another year makes no difference.  The receipt of income is as much a part of a business as the making of a contract that gives rise to such income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press does not prohibit the City of New York from imposing a Gross Receipts Tax on the receipts of an author derived from the grant of licenses to his rights in his literary works.  The tax applies not only to writers and publishers but to all businesses, professions, trades, vocations and commercial activities.  It applies to all without discrimination.  It is a general tax and not, in any sense, aimed at the press or at writers.  The city does not seek, through the guise of this tax, to regulate those covered by its provisions or to interfere with freedom of the press.  Its sole object is revenue notwithstanding the fact that the tax is called a privilege tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While many sales may have been made by the publisher in other States and countries, and it may be that the publisher was engaged in interstate and foreign commerce as a result, it does not follow that petitioner was likewise engaged in interstate and foreign commerce. The relationship between petitioner and his publishers was that of debtor and creditor -- not that of joint venturers or partners.  The sums paid to petitioner by way of &quot;royalties&quot; were merely the price for the licensing of certain of his literary rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Petitioner's activities are not so closely related to interstate commerce and foreign commerce that they must be treated as though they were activities in interstate or foreign commerce. The formation of a contract between persons in different States is not within the protection of the commerce clause unless the performance thereof is within its protection.  The writing by petitioner of books, plays, magazine articles, motion picture scripts and radio scripts, and the granting, within the city of New York, of licenses to certain of the rights therein is separate and distinct from the subsequent sale by others of books, magazines, etc., in interstate or foreign commerce even though the granting of the licenses may induce or occasion interstate commerce. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated cases, appellant town sought review of the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), which affirmed an order declaring that chapter 840 of the Laws of 1955 was invalid and that the acquisition of certain land was illegal and violated a town law and enjoining the town from establishing a park and public bathing beach in actions brought by respondents, village and residents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature enacted chapter 840 of the Laws of 1955 (the act) permitting the town to establish public bathing beaches, notwithstanding any other ordinance. The village and the residents brought an action alleging that the act was unconstitutional. The trial court decided in favor of the village and the residents, holding that the act was designed specifically to take from the villages within the town certain powers granted them by their charters, as embodied in the village law and, by reason thereof, the act must be deemed local in character and violative of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 17. The appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the appellate court, holding that the town had the authority, quite apart from the act, to establish a public bathing beach within village limits without village permission. That being so, the act confirmed and clarified a power which the town already possessed and could not, therefore, be subjected to any charge of unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 840 of the Laws of 1955 provides that, &quot;Notwithstanding any other general, special or local law, ordinance or regulation * * * the town of Huntington, in the county of Suffolk, may establish, maintain and operate public bathing beaches * * * on lands owned or leased by the town of Huntington * * * at any place within [its] boundaries&quot;.  The Town of Huntington acquired lands in villages within the town's territorial limits for the purpose of operating public bathing beaches. Both villages were zoned entirely for residence purposes only and, in effect, the zoning ordinances excluded such beaches. Prior to the enactment of chapter 840 of the Laws of 1955, three other statutes constituted grants of authority to a town to establish public parks in village territory within town limits (Town Law, &sect; 81, subd. 1, par. [d]; &sect; 220, subd. 4; L. 1906, ch. 87, as amd.).  Bathing beaches are parks. Accordingly, the town had authority, apart from chapter 840 of the Laws of 1955, to establish a public bathing beach within the village limits without village permission. Chapter 840 of the Laws of 1955 only confirmed and clarified a power which the town already possessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 4 of section 198 of the Town Law does not qualify the other statutes or require village consent to the establishment of a public park within its area.  It does not apply at all to public parks established by a town.  It deals solely with a &quot;park district&quot; park, which is a completely different type of park from a town public park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The village zoning ordinances limiting property to residential uses cannot prevent the town from setting up and maintaining such a park or beach. The zoning ordinances are contrary to the spirit and purpose of the zoning provisions of the Village Law pursuant to which they were enacted.  They bear no substantial relation to zoning purposes and are void to the extent that they would prevent the establishment of the public bathing beaches. Moreover, section 177 of the Village Law requires that zoning regulations shall &quot;facilitate the adequate provision of * * * parks&quot;.  Villages may not zone against public parks and beaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Chapter 840 of the Laws of 1955 gave no added authority to the town and took none from the village, and, accordingly, effected no change or alteration in any village charter and cannot be regarded as violative of the Constitution (N. Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 17).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The question whether the establishment and maintenance of a public park serve a governmental function is not reached and the court does not pass upon it.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp; Judgment accordingly. a town activity, here, the operation of a public bathing beach, may be regarded as governmental insofar as zoning is concerned (see, e.g., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Brush </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> v. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Commissioner, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 300 U.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regarding the plaintiffs' contention that chapter 840 of the Laws of 1955 violated the constitutional provision which forbids enactment of a private or local bill &quot;Incorporating villages&quot; (N. Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 17), little, if anything, need be said.  As already noted, the town long before 1955 was authorized to acquire lands within a village for use as a public beach without the consent of the village and despite zoning ordinances to the contrary; it follows, therefore, that the 1955 act merely confirmed and clarified the existence of a power already enjoyed by the town.  In other words, the statute, giving no added authority to the town and, by the same token, taking nothing from the villages, effected no change or alteration in any village charter and cannot possibly be regarded as violative of the constitutional provision.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant town sought review of the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the second judicial department (New York), which declared unconstitutional an ordinance prohibiting the transportation and dumping in the town of garbage originating outside the town. The town contended that the lower courts erred in dismissing its counterclaim to restrain respondent dumper's violation of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dumper operated a garbage dump located within the town in which he dumped garbage that he collected in neighboring towns. Shortly after the ordinance was enacted, the dumper brought an action challenging the validity of the ordinance on constitutional grounds. The trial court dismissed the town's counterclaim as legally insufficient, finding that the ordinance did violate the constitution. The court held that the part of the ordinance prohibiting transportation in the town of garbage originating outside the town clearly exceeded the power of the town to regulate traffic and commerce. However, the court held that the part of the ordinance prohibiting the dumping in the town of foreign garbage was a valid exercise of the police power. Garbage dumps were inherently nuisances. The town could limit the amount of garbage dumped in the town and the limitation to garbage generated within the town was not arbitrary. The discrimination in the ordinance was not based on quality. It was simply a measure to reduce, in a manner consistent with the interests of the citizens of the town, the quantity of garbage dumped into the town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court severed the prohibition against transportation from the prohibition against dumping and sustained the prohibition against dumping. It modified the judgment of the appellate court declaring the ordinance unconstitutional and remitted for further proceedings in accordance with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An ordinance of the town of Somers provides that no person may transport or dump, within the town, garbage originating outside of the town of Somers.  A parcel of real property in the town of Somers is used by plaintiff as lessee for the purpose of dumping and disposing of the garbage he collects in his carting business.  The parcel serves as a dump not only for the garbage collected in the town of Somers, but for all of the garbage collected from customers outside the town in outlying and surrounding communities,  villages and towns.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff appealed the ruling of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York County, which dismissed the plaintiff's cause of action for the granting of an insurance broker's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff took the examination for an insurance broker's license and passed. However, he was denied a license due to a statement in his application concerning his conscientious objection to war and military service on philosophical and religious grounds. The defendant denied the plaintiff's license citing the plaintiff's information furnished on the application. The court held that the order had to be reversed because the defendant must produce a rational basis for denying the plaintiff a broker's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the orders of the district court because the defendant could not make every conviction of a crime ipso facto a ground for the denial of an insurance broker's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- insurance broker's license -- conscientious objector -- Insurance Law ( &sect; 119) requires Superintendent of Insurance to hold formal hearing on issue of trustworthiness of applicant for insurance broker's license; matter remitted to Superintendent of Insurance since no hearing was held -- Insurance Law does not make conviction of crime ground for denial of application; despite petitioner's conviction of violation of Selective Service Act of 1948 (U. S. Code, tit. 50, Appendix, &sect; 462) because he did not qualify as conscientious objector,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> if Selective Service Board believed him to be sincere, denial of application for license, where conviction is only evidence of untrustworthiness, would be arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, who applied for a license as an insurance broker under section 119 of the Insurance Law, had been convicted of a violation of the Selective Service Act of 1948 (U. S. Code, tit. 50, Appendix, &sect; 462) when he sought to be classified as a conscientious objector. Although he passed the required examination, his application was denied on the ground that he could not be regarded as a &quot;competent and trustworthy person&quot; within the contemplation of the Insurance Law. Section 119 of the Insurance Law, read in the light of its history and purpose, requires that the Superintendent of Insurance hold a formal hearing on the issue of petitioner's trustworthiness. Since no such hearing was held, the matter is remitted to the Superintendent of Insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner may have been denied classification as a conscientious objector either because the Selective Service Board determined that he was insincere or because it felt that petitioner's beliefs, though sincerely held, did not fall within the definition of a conscientious objector as stated in the United States Code (tit. 50, Appendix, &sect; 456, subd. [j]).  The Insurance Law does not make conviction of a crime a ground for denial of an application.  If it is determined upon evidence that the Selective Service Board believed petitioner to be a sincere person but one whose beliefs did not entitle him to status as a conscientious objector, denial of his application for a license, where this is the only evidence of his untrustworthiness, would be arbitrary and capricious. On the other hand, if it is found that the board believed him to be insincere, then denial of the petitioner's application is within the discretion of the Superintendent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner has failed to show a denial of equal protection of the laws upon his allegation that a license was previously granted to a person in a similar situation.  There was no discrimination among persons in a similar situation at any given period.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought relief from an order of the County Court, Monroe County (New York) that reversed a judgment entered by a justice of the peace convicting defendant of a violation of N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant struck a young girl riding a bicycle. He was not charged with violating any of the express speed limits, nor was he charged with the crime of reckless driving under N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 58. Rather, he was charged with a criminal traffic infraction under the statute. On appeal, the court affirmed. It found that a criminal statute had to be sufficiently definite, clear, and positive to give unequivocal warning to citizens of the rule that was to be obeyed. The statute prohibited a person from driving at a speed to endanger other things, which was impossible at any speed, and only at a speed that allowed the vehicle to stop without endangering anything, which was impossible. While, the statutory draftsmen did not intend the statute to mean what it did and the prosecution offered a different interpretation of the statute's meaning, the court refused to twist the statute's language to render it valid. The court concluded that the statute was too vague to constitute a sufficient definition of criminal conduct, and contained no sufficient standard by which a driver's conduct could be tested, to be valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The church brought an action requesting a judgment declaring an individual to be rector of the church, and to restrain defendant members from interfering with the conduct of religious services or with the property or management of the church. The trial court found in favor of the church members, and held that the New York Religious Corporation Law (Act), N.Y. Relig.

The appellate division reversed, and held that the ecclesiastical nature of the election required on constitutional grounds that church law, not the Act, governed. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the lower court. Without reaching the constitutional claims, the court ruled that, on its face, the Act did not apply to the election of a rector. The court noted that Section 20 of the Act stated that no provision of the Act authorized the calling or governance of a meeting regarding the choice or removal of a minister. The court further noted that Section 20 of the Act was in accord with the history of the Act, which did not presume to govern qualifications of a quorum for ecclesiastical matters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The vestrymen of the Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity in Brooklyn, as authorized by the church's charter and by statute (Religious Corporations Law, &sect; 41), consisted of 2 churchwardens and 9 vestrymen but there were two vacancies among the vestrymen. Two churchwardens and 4 of the vestrymen, being a majority of the whole authorized vestry of 11, attended a vestry meeting and communicated to the Ecclesiastical Authority of the Diocese of Long Island, in which this parish is situated, their proposal to elect plaintiff Dr. Sidener as rector. The next day the Ecclesiastical Authority notified the vestry of the approval of the election and on that next day the election of Dr. Sidener was unanimously voted by the 6 members present.  General Canon 11, section 2, of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States provides that of any body consisting of several members, &quot;a majority of said members, the whole having been duly cited to meet, shall be a quorum; and a majority of the quorum so convened shall be competent to act&quot;.  Since the two meetings of the vestry were attended by a majority of the whole number of the vestry and all voted for Dr. Sidener's election, he was validly elected.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In addition, section 25 of the Religious Corporations Law provides that: &quot;No provision of this act authorizes the calling, settlement, dismissal or removal of a minister&quot; and that a meeting of a church corporation for such purpose shall be governed only according to the laws of the religious denomination or ecclesiastical governing body with which the church corporation is connected.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 1 of section 12 of the State Residential Rent Law (L. 1946, ch. 274, as amd.) provides that whenever the State Housing Rent Commission shall find that &quot;the percentage of vacancies in all or any particular class of housing accommodations is five per centum or more&quot;, rent control shall be abolished, except that the commission must hold a public hearing. The commission properly refused to find as requested by petitioners that hotels are a class of housing accommodations within the meaning of the statute, and that the phrase &quot;in * * * any particular class&quot; as contained in the statute refers, not to the location within a certain type of building, but to accommodations within a particular price range.  The commission had the authority to interpret those words as it did and did not abuse its discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioners, including a membership corporation representing hotels in New York City, have also failed to show a right to decontrol under that part of the statute which authorizes decontrol in &quot;any particular class of housing accommodations&quot; where &quot;the availability of adequate rental housing accommodations and other relevant factors are such as to make rent control unnecessary for the purpose of eliminating speculative, unwarranted, and abnormal increases in rents and of preventing profiteering and speculative and other disruptive practices resulting from abnormal market conditions caused by congestion&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The right to a hearing under the statute would follow only if the right to decontrol were established prima facie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. To refuse to place hotel accommodations, which include not only shelter but services also, in a separate class from other accommodations does not violate due process nor does it deny petitioners the equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Legislature has recently indicated that the emergency has not ceased as far as hotels are concerned, and the finding has not been shown to be without factual basis.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The foreign lawyer was a Mexican citizen and lawyer admitted to practice in the courts of that country. Although he was never a citizen of the United States nor a member of the state bar, he maintained offices in the city for a considerable period of time. At his offices, the foreign lawyer advised members of the public on Mexican law, including Mexican divorce law, and he acted as a consultant to members of the bar on Mexican legal matters. He also prepared legal papers and documents, which were required for the institution of divorce actions in Mexico. On the other hand, the foreign lawyer never gave advice as to state law, and he advised his clients to consult a state lawyer. The court affirmed the judgment by holding that the foreign lawyer was in contempt of court because he was not a member of the state bar and he did, indeed, engage in activities that constituted the practice of law pursuant to N.Y.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 270 of the Penal Law provides that it shall be unlawful for any person to practice as an attorney at law or to hold himself out to the public as being entitled to practice law without having first been licensed and admitted to practice law in this State.  A Mexican citizen and lawyer, admitted to practice in the courts of that country, but never a citizen of the United States nor a member of the New York Bar, has maintained offices in the city of New York and advertised in a daily newspaper that he is a Mexican lawyer in New York and advised members of the public on Mexican law, including Mexican divorce law.  He gives legal advice and renders legal services within the city and State of New York upon other matters pertaining to the laws of Mexico, prepares and draws legal documents, contracts, agreements and other papers applicable and pertaining to the laws of Mexico, and renders such services and advice within the city and State of New York to residents and citizens of New York.  He was properly adjudged in contempt (Judiciary Law, &sect; 750, subd.

The regents denied the request for a license on the ground that the movie was &quot;indecent.&quot; The appellate court annulled the decision of the regents and they appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the appellate court, holding that the movie could not have been banned unless it was &quot;obscene.&quot; Nothing sexually impure or filthy was shown in the movie and so there was no legal basis for censorship. The term &quot;indecent,&quot; as used in N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 122 meant &quot;obscene.&quot; However, the movie was not obscene. Obscenity, real, serious, not imagined or puritanically exaggerated, was a public evil, a public nuisance, a public pollution and there was no reason why democratic government should not have used democratic processes on a high administrative level, under the control of the courts, to suppress such obscenity. However, censorship was a necessary evil, a last resort, used only when necessary and limited to the necessity. The regents went far beyond even the permissible maximum of censorship.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 122 of the Education Law requires the Board of Regents to issue a license for the exhibition of a motion picture unless it is &quot;obscene, indecent, immoral, inhuman, sacrilegious, or is of such a character that its exhibition would tend to corrupt morals or incite to crime&quot;.  The Board of Regents should not have denied to petitioner a license to exhibit in this State a motion picture called &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; on the ground that it was &quot;indecent&quot;.  The word &quot;indecent&quot; means obscene. The picture is not obscene, and the Board of Regents did not declare it to be obscene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 1140-b of the Penal Law, read in connection with section 122 of the Education Law, does not create a statutory prohibition against the licensing of any motion picture showing a group of nude people of both sexes.  The statute (Penal Law, &sect; 1140-b) was not intended to make criminal in New York State any practice of nudism, wherever and by whomever practiced, even in secluded private grounds and by family groups, and it was not intended to deal with the exhibition of any motion picture. Even if the statute made criminal any and every practice of nudism in New York State, it does not follow that picturing such activity becomes criminal or indecent or justifies censorship. </SPAN></P>

A petition for the annexation of certain territory to the Village of Rockville Centre, signed by registered voters and by the owners of a majority in value of the real property of the territory, as assessed upon the last preceding regular assessment roll, and verified, complied with section 348 of the Village Law.

Since the board's determination refusing to consent to the annexation, the Legislature enacted chapter 818 of the Laws of 1954 amending the Nassau County Civil Divisions Act (&sect; 255.20), by which it attempted to supersede section 348 of the Village Law.

The Supreme Court at Special Term, Nassau County (New York) dismissed the operator's petition. On appeal, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) affirmed. The amateur radio operator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The amateur radio operator contended that the denial of the right to erect the tower constituted a deprivation of property without due process of law in contravention of state and federal constitutions and an unlawful invasion by the municipality into a field of regulation fully pre-empted by federal law. The court affirmed the denial of the permit, as the operator failed to establish that the proposed 44-foot rotary beam antenna tower was an accessory use customarily incidental to a highly classified residential area and that the Village of Westbury, N.Y., Amended Building Zone Ordinance, art. III, &sect; 8, was unconstitutional as construed and applied. The court concluded that the ordinance was justified under the police power of the state in balancing the unlimited exercise of the operator's hobby and the public interest.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, whose residence is located in a &quot;Residence A&quot; zone of the village of Westbury, is an amateur radio operator, and for seven years operated his station using an antenna on a 10-foot wooden pole.  He was properly denied a permit to replace it with a 44-foot steel tower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The proposed tower is not an accessory use of the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There was no sufficient showing that it was customary to have towers of the kind petitioner desired to erect in a residence area of a suburb.  There was no showing of the number of the 146,000 licensed amateur radio operators in the United States using antennae of this type or where amateur operators having such towers reside.  In the absence of such evidence, it cannot be said as a matter of law that the erection of this tower is a customarily incidental use of residential property or one which might commonly be expected by neighboring property owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There was some evidence as to the tendency of children to climb on such towers, and petitioner's offer to fence in the tower could have been regarded as insufficient protection.  There was evidence as to the effect of the proposed tower on property values, and also evidence from which it could be found that the tower would be an &quot;eyesore&quot; in an exclusively residential community occupied by private homes situated close to one another, and not in conformity with the character of the neighborhood.  It has not been shown that the ordinance is not justified under the police power of this State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A regulation of the Federal Communications Commission that &quot;No new antenna structure shall be erected * * * without prior approval by the Commission, in any case when * * * the antenna structure proposed to be erected will exceed an overall height of 170 feet above ground level&quot; (Code of Fed. Reg., tit. 47, &sect; 12.60, subd. [a]) was not intended totally to exclude all State and municipal governments from the right to regulate the height of proposed antennae. The local regulation does not conflict with the purposes of the Federal legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Petitioner has failed to establish that the Zoning Ordinance of the Village of Westbury as construed and applied herein is unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- voluntary payment of illegal tax -- taxes paid without protest may not be recovered -- section 112-f of Civil Practice Act, which provides that when relief against mistake is sought it shall not be denied merely because mistake is one of law rather than fact, was not intended to permit recovery of taxes paid without protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Taxes levied under the New York City General Business and Financial Tax Law were illegally levied since the local law has been held to be unconstitutional when applied to interstate business.  Taxpayers who paid the taxes without protest and not under duress are not entitled to a refund of the money paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Voluntary payments of a tax made under a mistake of law cannot be recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 112-f of the Civil Practice Act, which provides that &quot;When relief against mistake is sought in an action or proceeding or by way of defense or counterclaim, relief shall not be denied merely because the mistake is one of law rather than one of fact&quot;, does not require refunding these payments.  The statute empowers the court to act only in appropriate cases involving a mistake of law. It does not require that mistakes of law shall be treated in all instances as though they were mistakes of fact but merely removes a technical obstacle against granting relief for mistakes of law.  Recovery of taxes paid without protest does not come within the legislative intent in enacting section 112-f of the Civil Practice Act. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, operator of men's lodging houses, sued defendant state industrial commissioner, seeking to have declared invalid the commissioner's wage order, which established minimum wages for men in the hotel industry pursuant to N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 663-a. The operator appealed from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the trial court's order dismissing its complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the appellate court's decision. N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 663-a provided that no male 21 years of age or over could be employed in an occupation at less than the minimum standards or rates of wages fixed for women and minors in such occupation under a minimum wage order. While &sect; 663-a was part of article 19 of the New York Labor Law and article 19 was headed &quot;Minimum Wage Standards for Women and Minors,&quot; &sect; 663-a had a reasonable relation to the enforcement of the general policy of protecting women and minors in industry. The legislature realized that its objective of providing wage and hour protection for employed women and minors could not be realized if men workers could take the same jobs at wages lower than those set for women and children. The court held that &sect; 663-a was constitutional. It was no longer open to question that the fixing of a minimum wage was within the legislative power and that the bare fact of its exercise was not a denial of due process under the Fifth more than under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the appellate court's decision, which affirmed the trial court's decision dismissing the hotel operator's complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 651 of the Labor Law, contained in article 19 of the Labor Law which provides for minimum wage standards for women and minors, states that it is the public policy of the State that women and minors should receive wages sufficient to provide adequate maintenance and to protect their health.  Section 663-a, also contained in article 19, provides, &quot;To effectuate the aim of this article and to protect the minimum wage standards and rates provided for women and minors, no male twenty-one years of age or over shall be employed in an occupation at less than the minimum standards or rates of wages fixed for women and minors in such occupation under a minimum wage order.&quot; Section 663-a, although it deals directly with wages of men rather than women, has a reasonable relation to the enforcement of the general policy of protecting women and minors in industry.  The State Industrial Commissioner may enforce a mandatory wage order for the hotel industry as against &quot;flop houses&quot; although no women are employed there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 663-a of the Labor Law is not unconstitutional as a general minimum wage act for men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Moreover, it is not clear that a general minimum wage act for men would be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The fact that the wage order as applied to men contains no safeguards such as notice, hearing, and decisions of wage boards such as are required by article 19 of the Labor Law in connection with fixing the wages for women and children raises no constitutional question. The Legislature could take notice that the needs of men for maintenance and health are not less than that of women and that the value of the services of men and wages ordinarily paid to men in a given industry are not less than those of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Claims of invalidity and unreasonableness such as that the order is improperly applied to lodging houses where no women are employed and that cheap lodging houses giving no services beyond providing beds should not be included under the term &quot;hotel&quot; must be raised first by administrative review before the Board of Standards and Appeals (Labor Law, &sect;&sect; 110, 662).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. If the question were reached, the court would hold that these lodging houses are properly included under the term &quot;hotel&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The possibility that plaintiff will not be able to pay the minimum wage does not render the order unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, distributor and driver, sought review of an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which reversed the trial court's decision adjudging that defendant city's ordinance pertaining to vending in the public streets and public places was unconstitutional and which dismissed their complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The distributor peddled ice cream in city streets by means of trucks. Each truck was uniform in type and equipment and was run by a single employee. The city enacted an ordinance requiring that, in order to conduct such a business, the trucks had to have an attendant on them whose sole duty was to protect and safeguard children from injury. The distributor and driver brought an action for judgment declaring the ordinance unconstitutional and enjoining the enforcement of it against them. On appeal, the court found nothing to indicate that a second employee to maintain a general lookout for children would be more intimately related to the public safety, than the presence of a second employee to prevent the driver from handling prepackaged ice cream products would be related to the public health. The court held that the second employee would have no authority over the children and that the mere presence of two persons upon one vehicle signified nothing by itself. The court determined that the ordinance amounted to prohibiting the conduct of an occupation under the guise of regulation. The court concluded that the ordinance was unconstitutional and reversed the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff judgment creditor appealed from the order of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the trial court's grant of a motion to strike out the defense of defendant judgment debtor and a motion for judgment on the pleadings in an action to enforce a tort judgment obtained in Vermont against the debtor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment creditor, a resident of Vermont, obtained a final judgment against the judgment debtor, a resident of New York, in an action for alienation of her husband's affections and for criminal conversation. When the judgment could not be collected in Vermont, the creditor brought an action to enforce it in New York. The debtor interposed a defense based upon the provisions of Civil Practice Act art. 2-A relating to actions against the public policy of the state of New York which included actions based upon alleged alienation of affections and criminal conversation. The court noted that Article 2-A did not abolish an action on a judgment rendered in a sister state by a court having proper jurisdiction, and that U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1 provided that a judgment of a state court should have the same credit, validity, and effect in every other court in the United States which it had in the state where it was pronounced. The court concluded that the action was one to collect a debt, and as such was upon an entirely different cause of action from the Vermont tort action which merged in the judgment, and could not be called a suit on an action abolished in New York.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the appellate court affirming the trial court's striking of the defense and entry of judgment on the pleadings in the judgment creditor's action to enforce the judgment obtained in Vermont was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Prac. Act, art. 2-A).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff, a resident of Vermont, is entitled to enforce in New York a judgment which she recovered in Vermont against defendant, a resident of New York, in an action for alienation of her husband's affections and for criminal conversation. Article 2-A of the Civil Practice Act provides that action for &quot;alienation of affections, criminal conversation, seduction and breach of contract to marry&quot; may not be enforced in New York.  The present action in New York is a different cause of action from that which merged in the judgment.  An action on a judgment rendered in a sister State by a court having jurisdiction of the person and the subject matter does not contravene New York policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute refers to acts &quot;done within this state&quot; (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 61-d).  Defendant stated in her answer that &quot;many of the acts alleged therein were alleged to have occurred in the State of New York&quot;.  Defendant has not, by such answer, placed herself within the reach of the statute.  Plaintiff has not alleged, nor has defendant admitted, that the Vermont judgment is based on transactions which occurred within New York State, nor is there anything in the record indicating that the acts actually took place in New York State.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The executors sought a determination as to the validity of the husband's waiver and release of his right of election to take against his deceased wife's will. The surrogate court directed the clerk to take and report the testimony. The clerk ruled on 60 objections and interrogated the witnesses. The surrogate court declared that the waiver and release were valid. The appellate court affirmed. The husband appealed. The court affirmed because the waiver itself and the absence of worthy evidence of overreaching supported the finding that the waiver was not induced by fraud. The court held that the husband waived, by acquiescence, the question of improper delegation of judicial authority by actively participating in the taking of testimony and the original appeal without demurrer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The question whether the execution of the waiver had been induced by any actual or constructive fraud practiced by the decedent was one of fact.  The finding that it was not is supported by the record.  The sole testimony which relates to the alleged deceit of decedent was adduced by the husband's attorney.  The Surrogate was not in error in attaching little weight to this testimony as the husband was an interested witness, and the trier of the facts is free to disbelieve uncontroverted testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Surrogate directed the clerk of the court to take and report the testimony.  An alleged improper delegation of authority to the clerk is not reviewed because the husband consented to the procedures pursued by the clerk and the attorneys, not only by appearance at the hearing, but also affirmatively, by conduct during the hearing, and before and after the decision, and on the appeal to the Appellate Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Statements by the Surrogate as to the burden of proof were surplusage and should be treated as dictum and, in any event, the Appellate Division clearly defined the proof requisite to prove prima facie fraud in transactions between husband and wife.</SPAN></P>

E, &sect; E46-2.0) imposing a tax on the use of motor vehicles, and defined &quot;Use&quot; as &quot;Any use of a motor vehicle upon the public highways or streets of the city&quot; and &quot;Commercial vehicle&quot; as &quot;motor vehicles * * * used principally in connection with a business carried on within the city&quot; (Administrative Code, &sect; E46-1.0).  The tax imposed by the local law is not applicable to plaintiff, which operates as an authorized interstate motor common carrier. Plaintiff's trucks and trailers are not &quot;used principally in connection with a business carried on within the city&quot;.  Since under the language of the local law the tax does not apply, no constitutional question is reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff is a Pennsylvania corporation.  Its executive office and its corporate records are in New York City, and its corporate meetings are held there.  Its fleet of trucks and trailers is garaged at and dispatched from a site in Pennsylvania.  It transports products of a manufacturer of automobiles and parts to the manufacturer's dealers in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.  There are no &quot;return loads&quot;.  In summer, plaintiff picks up automobiles in Buffalo, brought there by Great Lakes steamships.  During the winter the automobiles are picked up by plaintiff at Detroit.  During these seasons plaintiff has small offices at Buffalo and Detroit from which bills are sent for payment at the New York office.  Plaintiff has 50 to 75 consignees in New York City, but no shipper-customers there.  About 65% of its income is received from delivery of automobiles to dealers in New York City, but its transportation charges are based on mileage and 95% or more of its total mileage is outside New York City.  On a weekday, 20 to 25 of plaintiff's 120 automobile-carrying tractors enter New York City.  Plaintiff's operations are such that its trucks and trailers are not &quot;used principally in connection with a business carried on within the city&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The legislative intent must have been to tax trucks of a business which is itself carried on principally in New York City.  New York City is not the place where plaintiff's interstate business is &quot;principally&quot; carried on.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner city employee challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) that affirmed an order of the supreme court that granted a motion by respondent New York City Transit Authority (authority) to dismiss the employee's petition that alleged wrongful termination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was discharged from his position of subway conductor by the authority on the ground that a reasonable basis existed for the belief that, because of his doubtful trust and reliability, his employment in the position of conductor endangered the security or defense of the nation and the state. The employee had refused to answer a question as to whether he was a member of the Communist party. The court affirmed and held that: (1) the authority was a board, body, or commission of the state or of any civil division thereof within the intendment of the Security Risk Law (Law), L. 1951, ch. 233, and the city commission of investigation had jurisdiction to conduct the inquiry; (2) the authority performed a function necessary to the security or defense of the nation and the state and thus it had been properly denominated a security agency under the Law; (3) the Law authorized the authority to suspend and discharge the employee merely upon a showing that the employee refused to answer whether he was a member of the Communist party and then stated that to answer might incriminate him within the meaning of the U.S. Constitution; and (4) the Law was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order of the appellate division that affirmed the supreme court's dismissal of the employee's wrongful termination action, with costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- removal -- subway conductor who refused to answer questions as to whether he was Communist party member, because to do so might tend to incriminate him, was properly discharged as security risk by New York City Transit Authority pursuant to State Security Risk Law (L. 1951, ch 233).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. At a hearing at the office of the commissioner of investigation of the City of New York, petitioner was asked whether he was then or had been a member of the Communist party, and he refused to answer on the ground that to do so might tend to incriminate him and that he was entitled to claim the privilege against self incrimination afforded him under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Petitioner has been properly discharged by the New York City Transit Authority upon the ground that a reasonable basis exists for the belief that, because of his doubtful trust and reliability, his employment in the position of subway conductor endangered the security or defense of the nation and the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Security Risk Law (L. 1951, ch. 233, &sect;&sect; 4, 5, 7) provides that a finding of disqualification and a determination of suspension, removal or transfer may be based upon evidence of previous conduct, which may include but shall not be limited to, membership in any organization or group found by the State Civil Service Commission to be subversive. The State Civil Service Commission listed the Communist party of the United States and the State of New York as subversive within the meaning of the Security Risk Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The New York City Transit Authority is a &quot;board, body or commission of the state or of any civil division thereof&quot; within the intendment of the provision of the Security Risk Law (&sect; 5) which authorized petitioner's discharge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The city's interest in the transit system is not only that of lessor of the physical properties -- an interest which petitioner argues does not justify its interrogation of employees of the Transit Authority.  Although it has leased the rapid transit facilities to the Transit Authority, the city is required to pay the cost of the capital improvements, and so has a proprietary interest in preserving and protecting those facilities from sabotage or destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Moreover, the very existence of the city is dependent on the safe and uninterrupted operation of the transit system. An investigation to determine whether employees of the transit system are members of subversive organizations or are of doubtful trust and reliability is &quot;in the best interests of the city&quot; (New York City Charter, &sect; 803, subd. 2).  That being so, the investigation was properly initiated by the commissioner of investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The Public Authorities Law confers upon the Transit Authority the right to avail itself of the services of the officers and agencies of the city government (see Public Authorities Law, &sect; 1803, subd. 3, par. b).  The authority must be said to have exercised its right to make use of the services of the commissioner of investigation and, in effect, to have authorized the commission to conduct an investigation on its behalf when it directed the petitioner to appear before the commissioner to answer questions designed to ascertain whether he was of doubtful trust or reliability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The Transit Authority was properly designated a security agency (&sect; 2).  The Transit Authority performs a function necessary to the security or defense of the nation and the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The refusal to reply to the question as to Communist party membership is &quot;evidence&quot; of &quot;doubtful trust and reliability&quot;.  Petitioner was not discharged on the ground that he was a Communist party member. He was discharged for having created a doubt by declining to answer whether he was or was not a member.  By refusing to answer the question asked by his employer whether he was then a member of the Communist party, petitioner would have given evidence of his own untrustworthiness and unreliability.  The situation is not changed when he goes further and says that he refused to answer because to do so might tend to incriminate him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The wisdom of the Legislature in extending the Security Risk Law beyond the period of the Korean War has been confirmed by world events transpiring since the Korean truce, and it may not be said that the Security Risk Law is unconstitutional because an emergency no longer existed in 1954 when petitioner was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Petitioner's position of subway conductor has a rational connection with the national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The Security Risk Law, as construed and applied to petitioner, is not unconstitutional ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Slochower </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Board of Educ</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 350 U.S. 551, distinguished).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Petitioner's argument that he asserted his constitutional privilege with respect to a Federal crime and as a part of his national citizenship so that his dismissal abridged his privileges and immunities as a citizen of the United States is untenable in this situation, where he uses the privilege to thwart his employer in ascertaining whether or not he is a member of a criminal conspiracy.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant for five counts of criminal contempt, under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 600, subject only to a remission directed in a separate case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of five counts of criminal contempt under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 600 because he refused, as a witness under subpoena before a grand jury, to state definitely who were the participants in five telephone conversations which had been wire-tapped and the recordings of which were read to defendant before the grand jury. Defendant had been one of the speakers, and in each case the other speaker was well known to defendant. The court affirmed, rejecting defendant's contention that he had been prevented from answering by the Federal Communications Act (Act). There was no support for defendant's contention that the Act granted any kind of privilege to a telephone talker against divulgence by the person on the other end of the telephone of the contents of the talks. Further, because defendant pretended that he did not remember the voices and the conversations, it was proper to show the trial jury that defendant must have recognized the voices because he had had numerous and important transactions with those persons. The state established to the satisfaction of the trial jury that defendant did remember the conversations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant for criminal contempt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- criminal contempt -- trial jury justified in finding that defendant's failure to answer questions put to him by Grand Jury as to identity of one conversing with him in wire-tapped telephone conversations amounted to criminal contempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, an insurance broker, was indicted for five crimes of criminal contempt as the result of the Grand Jury's inquiry into alleged violations of the Insurance Law and of the Penal Law. The trial jury's verdict of guilt amounted to findings that defendant, on his appearances as a witness under subpoena before the Grand Jury on March 11 and 15, 1954, had been five times guilty of contumacious refusals to answer legal and proper questions, in failing to state definitely who were the participants in five wire-tapped telephone conversations, the recordings of which were read to defendant before the Grand Jury.  On the trial, it was proved that in each of those wire-tapped telephone conversations defendant had been one of the speakers; that the other speaker and his voice were well known to defendant, and that each such conversation had to do with defendant's business dealings.  The trial jury was justified in finding that defendant's failure to answer those questions and his evasiveness when he did answer amounted to criminal contempts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The recordings made of the telephone conversations, which had been intercepted by wire tappings authorized by court orders pursuant to section 813-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, were admissible in evidence.  Such admission did not violate section 605 of the Federal Communications Act (U. S. Code, tit. 47, &sect; 605), which provides that no person, who is not authorized by the sender, shall divulge an intercepted communication to any person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 813-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure is constitutional. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The divulgence asked of defendant before the Grand Jury did not come within the language of the Federal Communications Act (&sect; 605), and such divulgence would not have been a voluntary one but under compulsion of a subpoena. Section 605 is intended to prevent or punish intrusion into the telephone conversation of others, but the section does not grant any kind of privilege to a talker on a telephone against divulgence of the contents of the talks by the person on the other end of the telephone wire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The giving of the testimony here would not be a crime under the New York Penal Law ( &sect; 1423, subd. 6) which forbids wire tapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. It was not prejudicial error to let the trial jury hear all of defendant's examination before the Grand Jury.  Before the Grand Jury, defendant swore that his failure to state whether he had taken part in such telephone conversations was because he could not recall the conversations. The prosecution showed, by some parts of defendant's Grand Jury testimony, that defendant must have recognized the voices because he had had numerous and important transactions with those persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. No prejudice to defendant could have resulted from his pre-immunity Grand Jury testimony on March 2, 1954, which was put before the trial jury, since such March 2 testimony was preliminary and background testimony as to the place, personnel and methods of operation of defendant's insurance brokerage business, and it had no tendency in itself to convict defendant of contempt. The alleged contempts themselves were all committed on March 11 and March 15, after an effective grant of immunity to defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Thirteen of the grand jurors, who voted for the true bill, were present on March 11 and 15, 1954 -- the two days on which the recordings were read to defendant and on which he failed to identify the voices -- and on May 13, 1954, the day the indictment was voted. Fewer than 12 of those jurors who indicted defendant were in attendance on March 2 and on April 20, on which days testimony of background and explanatory material was heard by the Grand Jury.  Enough testimony was heard on March 11 and 15 to justify the indictment, and more than 12 of the voting jurors heard all of the testimony on those two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Defendant was guilty of five contempts because his contumacious conduct had to do with five separate telephone talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Defendant's rights were not invaded where the prosecutor presented to defense counsel, prior to the trial, copies of all the investigation reports which he had as to the special jurors comprising the &quot;blue ribbon&quot; trial jury and, accordingly, defendant's counsel had the same information that the prosecutor had, well before the trial.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a committee representing an incompetent, sought reargument after the United States Supreme Court reversed the prior decision of the court, which affirmed an appellate court decision that affirmed a trial court judgment to respondent town, allowing the town to foreclose a tax lien on property owned by the incompetent pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 65 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The committee claimed that the incompetent landowner was not aware of the town's claim for unpaid taxes and the proceedings to enforce its tax lien against the incompetent's property and that enforcement of the tax lien was a violation of due process. The town claimed that N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 165-h(7) provided the exclusive remedy to the committee and the committee, having failed to elect that remedy, was not entitled to challenge the presumption that the proceedings were valid. The court affirmed the appellate court's order that affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the town and held that compliance with &sect; 165-h(7) was the exclusive remedy of the committee to challenge the action taken by the town and the committee had not chosen to follow that procedure, so it waived its right to do so after the time limitations of &sect; 165-h(7) had expired. The court further held that &sect; 165-h(7) provided adequate due process when the committee knew that the proceedings had been initiated by the town to enforce its tax lien, even though the committee was representing an incompetent person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the appellate court's order that affirmed the trial court's judgment for the town, which foreclosed the town's tax lien on the property of the incompetent, who was represented by the committee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- tax titles -- incompetent persons -- where deed of property of incompetent has been delivered and recorded in in rem tax foreclosure proceeding, attack on sufficiency of notice prescribed by Tax Law ( &sect;&sect; 165-a, 165-b) may be made only in action under Tax Law ( &sect; 165-h, subd. 7) within statutory two-year period; motion by committee of incompetent to open default in foreclosure proceeding properly denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action in rem by a town to foreclose a tax lien, the committee of the incompetent owner moved, about one year after a deed of the property was delivered to the town, to open the owner's default and to vacate the judgment of foreclosure. The Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the Appellate Division which affirmed an order of the County Court denying the committee's motion, and granted a motion by the committee to amend the remittitur and recited that, on the appeal, there was presented and necessarily passed upon a question under the United States Constitution, viz., whether the taking of the property by the town was, &quot;on this record, a deprivation of due process and equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment&quot; (308 N. Y. 798, 941). The Court of Appeals meant by the amendment that the State may properly impose a time limit in which a defendant could answer or redeem, and that such a time limit does not constitute a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment in a case such as this where the incompetent has a period of two years after the recording of the deed in which to bring an action to set it aside (Tax Law, &sect; 165-h, subd. 7), a committee had been appointed 20 months before the expiration of such period, and the committee had been advised by the opinion of the County Court well before the expiration of said two-year period that an action to set aside the deed, and not a motion to vacate the default, was the proper remedy. Had such amendment of the remittitur stated the precise ground of the decision of the Court of Appeals, the United States Supreme Court would not have reversed the determination of the Court of Appeals, inasmuch as the Supreme Court stated that &quot;no constitutional question could have been reached if the Court of Appeals had been of the opinion that the appellant [committee] had pursued the wrong remedy&quot; ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Covey </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Town of Somers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 351 U.S. 141, 144). Accordingly, upon reargument following remand by the United States Supreme Court to the Court of Appeals, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The court has not held that the notice, prescribed by sections 165-a and 165-b of the Tax Law to the effect that, if the amount of the unpaid tax lien, together with interest and penalties, was not paid within seven weeks or an answer interposed within 20 days after the last date for redemption, any person having the right to redeem or answer would be forever foreclosed of all his interest and equity of redemption in the affected property, is sufficient to satisfy the demands of due process in the case of a known incompetent. Where, however, a deed has been recorded and delivered, as here, an attack on the sufficiency of the notice may be made only in an action under the Tax Law ( &sect; 165-h, subd. 7).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prosecution appealed a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York, in the Fourth Judicial Department, which reversed a judgment against criminal defendant for violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1053-a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Criminal defendant struck and killed a number of children after allegedly suffering a seizure while driving. Defendant was placed under arrest and taken to a hospital for treatment. While at the hospital, defendant related his medical history to a physician who diagnosed defendant as suffering from epilepsy. Defendant was charged with violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1053-a. At trial, the physician testified as to his conversation with defendant. Defendant argued that his actions were not sufficiently culpable to violate &sect; 1053-a and that the physician's testimony should have been inadmissible. The court first held that defendant's conduct arguably fell within the statute's requirement that defendant exhibit a disregard for the consequences that would ensue from his actions. The court then held that, as the physician diagnosed defendant and defendant was given no reason to believe their communication was not confidential, the conversation was barred under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 352.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the reversal of the judgment against criminal defendant in fatal automobile accident, because physician's testimony at trial was inadmissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- criminal negligence in operation of vehicle -- indictment which stated that defendant, knowing that he was subject to epileptic seizures, was culpably negligent in consciously operating automobile and while so doing suffered seizure causing his automobile to drive over sidewalk and kill 4 persons (Penal Law, &sect; 1053-a), sufficient -- communications between defendant and hospital</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> doctor, who took his medical history while other hospital doctors treated him, privileged under Civil Practice Act ( &sect; 352) -- presence in hospital room of police guard within hearing of communications did not destroy such privilege; judgment of conviction improper for erroneous admission of communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An indictment which stated that defendant, knowing that he was subject to epileptic attacks rendering him likely to lose consciousness, was culpably negligent in that he consciously operated his automobile and while so doing suffered an epileptic attack causing his automobile to drive over a sidewalk, causing the death of 4 persons (Penal Law, &sect; 1053-a), is sufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant, after he was arrested, was sent to a county hospital in custody of policemen, a police guard was stationed in the doorway of his room, and a staff doctor visited defendant.  Although the doctor testified that he personally did not treat defendant, he admitted that other doctors in the hospital did treat him for Jacksonian epilepsy, and he admits he made that diagnosis.  A physician-patient relationship existed between the doctor and defendant even though there was a division of duties among the staff of the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The communications made to the doctor by defendant relating to his epileptic seizure and his past medical history were necessary for the doctor to act in his professional capacity, and were therefore privileged under section 352 of the Civil Practice Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The presence of the police guard in the doorway of the hospital room where he could overhear the conversation between the doctor and defendant did not destroy the privilege arising under section 352 of the Civil Practice Act. Accordingly, defendant's communications to the doctor should not have been admitted in evidence and the judgment of conviction was properly reversed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Defendant cannot raise the question that the hospital record was improperly received in evidence before the Grand Jury, and that the indictment should therefore be dismissed, where he made no motion for an inspection of the minutes of the Grand Jury and such minutes are not part of the present record and the court is not in a position to know what other proper evidence may have been adduced as a basis for the indictment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county sought relief from a decision by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) affirming an order issued by the trial court denying its motion to vacate an order directing it to pay for the transcript of appellee wife's matrimonial case. The wife was granted such relief upon receiving permission to prosecute her appeal as a poor person under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect;&sect; 199, 1493.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the wife presented her order to the county, the county resisted payment and asserted that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to issue the order, the wife did not statutorily qualify as poor, and the wife failed to properly notice the county about her application for such relief. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower courts' decisions. It found that the appellate court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the wife was poor within the statutory prerequisites, even though it did not consider the real property jointly owned with her husband as part of her worth, because the statute contemplated valuation of property actually and presently available. The fact that her action was tried by a referee was immaterial. The trial court was authorized to grant her requested relief. When judgment was entered on the referee's report and the trial court lost jurisdiction, the wife properly applied to the appellate court for permission to appeal as a poor person. The statute was silent about prior notice to the county. But, the issue of notice did not need to be considered because the county moved to vacate and had a hearing on the merits that constituted due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the appellate court's decision affirming the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- poor persons -- stenographer's fees -- Special Term in contested marital action properly directed, under Civil Practice Act ( &sect; 1493), that county furnish wife, whom Appellate Division permitted to prosecute appeal as poor person, transcript of testimony of trial in said action -- omission from section 1493 of requirement of prior notice to county of wife's application does not render it </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A husband's complaint for separation and his wife's counterclaim for similar relief were dismissed, and husband and wife appealed.  The Appellate Division permitted her to prosecute the appeal as a poor person. Thereafter, Special Term, pursuant to section 1493 of the Civil Practice Act, properly directed that the clerk of the county furnish to the wife an original and a copy of the transcript of the testimony of the trial, and that the statutory fees of the official stenographer for preparing the same be paid by the county treasurer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Appellate Division had power to permit the wife to prosecute her appeal as a poor person where she showed that she was not worth $ 300 &quot;in cash or available property&quot; (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 199; Rules Civ. Prac., rule 35).  The Appellate Division correctly treated the real property jointly owned by the wife and the husband as not &quot;available&quot; within the meaning of the statute, for the statutory phrase &quot;available property&quot; contemplates property actually and presently available.  In any event, the granting of the relief rested in the court's sound discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 1493 of the Civil Practice Act authorizes either the trial judge or the court to grant the relief demanded,  and the court here was the Supreme Court held in Sullivan County, notwithstanding that the marital action was tried before an Official Referee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. When judgment was entered on the Official Referee's report, his jurisdiction terminated and the wife properly applied to the Appellate Division for permission to appeal as a poor person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The omission from section 1493 of a requirement of prior notice to the county does not render it constitutionally invalid. The issuance of a certificate to an official stenographer, as provided in section 1493, does not actually prejudice the county since the county's public moneys are not actually taken until the certificate is paid.  Whether or not notice is to be implied need not be considered since the county moved to vacate that part of the order directing it to pay the costs of the minutes and had a hearing on the merits.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Municipal Court of the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, Ninth District (New York) dismissed appellant landlord's claim that the Business Rent Law, 1955 N.Y. Laws 701, was unconstitutional in the landlord's actions against appellee tenants. The landlord challenged the orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The business rent control statute was passed during World War II when nonessential civilian construction of business space stopped. Because of increasing demands for that space, business tenants were in a hopeless bargaining position with their landlords. The statute was reenacted for several years up through 1955. The court affirmed the order finding that the statute was constitutional. There was a reasonable basis for the legislature to find that the continuance of the rent controls was justified. The resolution of the question as to the existence of an emergency and a need for rent control was properly for the legislature. The court could not substitute its own evaluation of the weight of conflicting proof as to that question for that of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1955 re-enactment of the Business Rent Law (L. 1955, ch. 701), insofar as it affects office space only, is deemed constitutional where the representatives of the landlord, by their own evidence at this trial in summary proceedings to remove a tenant from real property and before the legislative commission, did no more than raise a conflict of testimony and opinion -- a debatable question as to the existence of an emergency and the need for rent control as to office space. The resolution of that question was properly for the Legislature.  There was a rational basis for the legislative finding of an emergency, and no court may substitute therefor its own evaluation of the weight of such conflicting proof.  </SPAN></P>

The electrician argued that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; B30-16.0 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The electrician was licensed as a motion picture operator and as a master electrician by the commissioner. He admitted that he had been employed for as a motion picture operator, but claimed that he was engaged as a master electrician during the hours when he was not engaged as a projectionist. The commissioner suspended his master electrician license until he demonstrated that he was not principally engaged in other business in violation of &sect; B30-16.0. The electrician argued that the part of &sect; B30-16.0, which enabled the commissioner to suspend or revoke a license on the ground of being principally engaged in business other than that of a master electrician, was violative of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6, 1 and also U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The court affirmed the finding that &sect; B30-16.0 was constitutional and that the electrician's master electrician license was properly suspended for being engaged in another business. The court held that the city had a reasonable basis upon which to act to suspend the license under &sect; B30-16.0 and that &sect; B30-16.0 was not arbitrary and confiscatory. The court found that supervision and responsibility was a reasonable basis for the legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the denial of the electricians' request to have the commissioner's suspension of his master electrician's license set aside.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- licenses -- master electrician -- Administrative Code of City of New York (&sect; B30-16.0), which permits city commissioner to suspend or revoke license of master electrician on ground that he is principally engaged in other business, is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner was licensed as a motion picture operator and also as a master electrician by respondent New York City Commissioner of the Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity. Petitioner admitted that he had been employed for three nights a week as a motion picture operator at a theatre; and at a hearing held by the department's license board stated that he was a &quot;projectionist&quot;, that he had his name on a window of a hardware store and that the store owner took orders for his services as an electrician. The board recommended to the commissioner that petitioner's master electrician's license be suspended, and respondent commissioner notified petitioner of the resolution of said board.  Petitioner's motion for an order to annul the determination of respondent and to direct him to issue a master electrician's license to petitioner was properly denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The portion of the Administrative Code of the City of New York (&sect; B30-16.0), which enables the commissioner to suspend or revoke a license, after a hearing before said board, on the ground of the licensee's &quot;being principally engaged in * * * business&quot; other than that of a master electrician, is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The City Council had a reasonable basis on which to enact section B30-16.0 of the Administrative Code, in view of the inherently dangerous nature of electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There is a reasonable basis for requiring that master electricians be not principally occupied in any other business.  Under the Administrative Code, the master electrician is the person who has &quot;the full responsibility&quot; for the determination of the manner in which the work is done, the materials used, and the selection, supervision and control of employees (&sect; B30-4.0, subd. 54) and no firm, partnership or corporation may have more than one master electrician in its employ (&sect; B30-4.0, subd. 55).  If a person who is a master electrician is not principally engaged in the electrical business but is principally engaged in some other endeavor, the degree of responsibility, which is forced upon him to adhere to the legislative enactments and to the board's regulations and to prevent him from &quot;cutting corners&quot; in order to save time and money, is greatly reduced.  The power which the board has over such a person of revoking or suspending his master electrician's license is not as certain a method of control as it is over those who are principally engaged in the business, for those principally engaged in the business must protect their business interest by protecting their master electrician's license, or their business will no longer exist by reason of the provisions of the Administrative Code and of the rules thereunder.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner a diocese appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed an order entered in an N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding in the trial court and dismissed the petition because no triable issue of fact had been raised and affirming respondent town planning board's decision to deny the diocese a permit to build a church and school in a residential area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The diocese alleged that the town planning board's decision was arbitrary and unreasonable and an abuse of discretion and that an ordinance and decision violated the constitution. The trial and appeals courts held that the diocese could not attack the constitutionality of the ordinance and that they could not substitute their judgment for that of the town as long as there was some basis for the determination. The court reversed and held that the diocese could challenge the constitutionality of the way the ordinance had been construed and applied. The court examined the town's reasons, which included that no church or school could be located in a built-up area, that property values would drop, and that potential tax revenue would be lost, but found that none justified denial of the permit. The ordinance was enacted to promote the public health, safety, morals, and the general welfare. The court found that church and school would further public morals and general welfare and would not jeopardize the public health or the public peace or safety. The court annulled the town's decision because it bore no substantial relation to the ordinance's purposes and was arbitrary and unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- church, school and accessory uses -- church may not be excluded from residential district under zoning ordinance -- on record, decisions of respondent town bodies denying permit to construct church, school and accessory uses in residential district, bear no substantial relation to promotion of public health, safety, morals or general welfare, are arbitrary and should be annulled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A zoning ordinance of the Town of Brighton provided that in Class A of the residential districts a religious building and accessory uses were permitted &quot;if approved by the Planning Board&quot;.  Petitioner Diocese of Rochester entered into a contract to purchase from copetitioner certain property located in a Class A residential district, and thereafter applied to the town planning board and to the town board of appeals for a permit to construct a Roman Catholic church and school, a meeting room, kindergarten, small games, open field and hard-top play areas, and a parking lot to accommodate 144 cars.  Respondent town planning board denied petitioner's application and respondent town board of appeals denied petitioner's application for a variance. Thereafter, respondent town board affirmed the determinations of the planning board and the board of appeals.  The determinations of all three said town bodies should be annulled and the matter remitted to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In general, a party cannot, in the same proceeding, rely upon a statute or retain benefits thereunder and attack its constitutionality, but even if the zoning ordinance here involved be deemed valid and constitutional for the purposes of this proceeding, the petitioners may attack the constitutionality of the decisions of the planning board, the board of appeals and the town board here involved, as distinguished from the constitutionality of the ordinance itself.  An ordinance, constitutional on its face, may be construed and applied in an unconstitutional manner; and, if an ordinance, when construed and applied to a particular piece of property and a particular set of facts, is so arbitrary and unreasonable as to result in an invasion of property rights, the action of the boards thereunder will be invalidated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since this petition alleged that petitioners had been deprived of their property without due process of law and that they have been deprived of their rights to the free exercise of religion and to impart and receive religious instruction and education, petitioners need not allege or prove discrimination to establish their claim that the ordinance has been construed and applied so as to violate such constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A zoning ordinance may not wholly exclude a church or synagogue from a residential district. The planning board determined, in effect, that the proposed church and school could be built only in an outlying area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. An adverse effect upon property values is an unauthorized standard to apply in determining whether to grant this permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The State Constitution (art. XVI, &sect; 1) and the Tax Law ( &sect; 4, subd. 6) provide that real and personal property used exclusively for religious purposes shall be exempt from taxation.  Accordingly, the permit could not be denied because of a loss of tax revenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Noises and other inconveniences are insufficient grounds to deny a permit to a church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The accessory uses proposed by petitioner are allowed by the ordinance and are within the scope of a church's activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Since, on the record, the decisions of the planning board, the board of appeals and the town board bear no substantial relation to the promotion of public health, safety, morals or general welfare of the community, they are arbitrary and unreasonable and should be annulled. </SPAN></P>

Section 23 of article VI of the State Constitution, approved by the People in 1949 and effective January, 1950, continues the Court of Claims as a court of record, fixes the number, method of appointment, terms, qualifications, etc., of the judges and provides that &quot;The court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine claims against the state or by the state against the claimant or between conflicting claimants as the legislature may provide.&quot; There is nothing in the language or history of section 23 of article VI to support a construction that the Legislature could not validly confer on the Court of Claims jurisdiction over claims that are asserted, not against the State itself, but against the State Thruway Authority, which is an arm or agency of the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant husband appealed the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), in that it affirmed the decision that awarded plaintiff wife maintenance, counsel fees, and costs, and directed payment thereof. The wife appealed the judgment in that it (1) adjudged the Nevada divorce decree to bar a separation cause of action, (2) dismissed her complaint for a separation, and (3) failed to adjudge jurisdiction over the husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife filed for a separation and an award of alimony in New York. The husband, appearing specially, claimed lack of jurisdiction and contested the action on several grounds. The court affirmed the intermediate court's judgment. The court found that N.Y. Civ. Pract. Act &sect;1170-b (1953) applied because the action was for a separation, where relief was refused because a divorce had previously been granted in an action where jurisdiction over the wife had not been obtained. Under &sect; 1170-b the wife could obtain protection of those support rights that remained after and despite of the foreign divorce. Due process required personal service within Nevada to support a judgment against the wife, such that the part of the foreign divorce decree, which dealt with status, had to be given effect in New York as to terminate the marriage but was entitled to no effect at all so far as support or other property rights were concerned. A Nevada finding of fact, in an in rem proceeding, while conclusive as to the marriage status being dissolved, did not bind the wife personally nor was it conclusive as to any fact upon which the Nevada judgment was based.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment, with costs to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and wife -- alimony for wife where foreign divorce previously granted to husband on nonpersonal jurisdiction -- section 1170-b of Civil Practice Act, providing that, in marital action where court refuses to grant relief by reason of finding that marital judgment had previously been granted to husband in action in which jurisdiction over person of wife was not obtained, court may nevertheless render, in same action, such judgment as justice may require for wife's maintenance, is constitutional -- State may validly grant alimony after and in spite of foreign ex parte divorce decree -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> does not apply only to marriages where parties had lived together in this State as their matrimonial domicile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  In this action the trial court, holding that a Nevada divorce obtained by defendant husband on nonpersonal jurisdiction of the wife was binding in New York to dissolve the marriage, dismissed the wife's complaint insofar as it asked for a separation and properly awarded the wife alimony, counsel fees and expenses on the authority of section 1170-b of the Civil Practice Act, which provides that, in a marital action (here, an action for separation) where the court refuses to grant relief by reason of a finding by the court that a divorce had previously been granted to the husband in an action in which jurisdiction over the person of the wife was not obtained, the court may, nevertheless, render in the same action such judgment &quot;as justice may require&quot; for the maintenance of the wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 1170-b of the Civil Practice Act is valid.  A State may grant alimony after and in spite of a foreign ex parte divorce. It is not necessary that the wife have her rights to support adjudicated before the husband secures such divorce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 1170-b was not intended to apply only to marriages where the parties had lived together in this State as their matrimonial domicile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Nevada judgment has not been denied &quot;full faith and credit&quot; (U. S. Const., art. IV, &sect; 1).  Under the &quot;divisible divorce&quot; doctrine, the sole effect of the husband's Nevada divorce was to end the marriage, and it has been given that effect in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The phrase &quot;as justice may require&quot; in section 1170-b is not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The statute itself gave adequate notice to the husband that, if no separation were granted, an award for maintenance might still be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The husband did not, by his subsequent activities in the case, waive his contention as to lack of jurisdiction (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 237-a, subd. 3, par. [c]; &sect; 237-a, subd. 4).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. There was sufficient evidence to justify the finding that the husband had established a domicile in good faith in Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The amount of the award of alimony and the direction that it be retroactive to the date of the commencement of the separation action were proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The wife, having resided in this State for the required one-year period (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1165-a, subd 3), had standing to bring an action for separation under section 1170-b, and jurisdiction was effected by the sequestration of the husband's New York assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The Appellate Division had the power to make a finding that the husband had violently assaulted the wife and had been guilty of other cruel treatment which endangered and injured her health, although the trial court had not made such finding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. The Nevada court's determination in an in rem proceeding that the husband was entitled to a divorce because of the wife's cruelty, while conclusive as to the dissolution of the marriage status, did not bind the wife personally nor was it conclusive as to any fact upon which the Nevada judgment was based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. The husband was not denied a fair opportunity to present proof as to alimony. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

Subsequently his conviction was reversed by the Appellate Division and a new trial ordered on questions of law only, the facts being affirmed.  Respondent has not been retried and his name has not been stricken from the roll of attorneys.  The language of the statute and the public policy which it expresses accomplished respondent's automatic removal from the profession upon his conviction.  In the present proceeding, the Appellate Division improperly determined that the reversal of the conviction left respondent in the same status as if there had been no conviction.</SPAN></P>

The First Amendment to the United States Constitution guaranteeing freedom of speech and press does not prohibit the type of prior restraint contained in section 22-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure which gives the New York Supreme Court jurisdiction to enjoin, on suit of the chief executive or legal officer of any city, town or village, the sale, distribution, acquisition or possession of &quot;obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, indecent or disgusting&quot; written or printed matter.</SPAN></P>

The appellate division dismissed the complaint that questioned the authority of a local town board to delegate power to a local board of trustees through a proposition adopted at a special town meeting.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The people argued that the board of trustees usurped the powers of the town board and could not engage in certain town improvements without prior approval because trustees were separate and apart from the town board. The court affirmed the judgment that dismissed the complaint and held that the contracts in question, which were analogous to the facilitation of transportation, were proprietary in nature. Prior authorization or subsequent approval of the electors was not required and adoption by the town board was therefore needless. The court held that the legislature had the power to enact a statute that defined, clarified, confirmed its powers, and ratified the exercise of such powers. The court concluded that prior decisional laws and legislative acts conclusively established that the board of trustees had the power to enter the contracts described without the approval of electors at town elections. The court held that every statute was presumed to be constitutional, and every intendment was in favor of its validity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A resolution of the town board of the Town of Huntington provided for a special election of the voters of the town to be held on May 15, 1951, to vote on a single proposition approving or disapproving the action of the &quot;Supervisor, Justices of the Peace and Town Clerk of the Town of Huntington&quot; -- who constitute the &quot;Board of Trustees of the Town of Huntington&quot; in contradistinction to the &quot;Town Board of the Town of Huntington&quot; of which the town clerk is not a member -- in acquiring beach property for the town, in making lease-purchase agreements for acquiring parking and recreation areas in the town, in making contracts with a certain dredging corporation for the sale and disposal of gravel and sand and for the dredging of Huntington's harbors and bays, and in using the revenues from said contracts for the purposes of the acquisition of the beach and the parking and recreation areas.  The complaint, in a taxpayer's action for a judgment declaring the resolution of the town board and the proposition as approved at the special election void, was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Chapter 816 of the Laws of 1952 ratifying and confirming the powers of the board of trustees of the Town of Huntington to acquire and manage real property and ratifying and confirming the acts of said board of trustees, which chapter was enacted after this action was tried and after said proposition was approved by the electors, is applicable to this action, since chapter 816 was enacted to clarify the right of the board of trustees to exercise certain powers then under dispute, and since, moreover, this action must be decided upon the basis of the law as it exists at the time of the decision of the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Chapter 816 of the Laws of 1952, together with prior legislative acts and decisional law, establish the powers of the board of trustees of the Town of Huntington to enter into the contracts described in the proposition without the approval of the electors at a town election. Such construction of the statute does not extend the trustees' proprietary powers so as to include important governmental powers or to interfere with the co-existing town board. Chapter 816 does not ratify the contracts included in the proposition, but only confirms the power of the trustees to enter into the contracts; and such confirmation is not a ratification of any corrupt or improvident conduct indulged in by the trustees in connection with the exercise of such powers, and cannot protect them against the consequences of a suit or proceeding in which a violation of their trust is proved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The presumption of constitutionality of chapter 816 of the Laws of 1952 has not been overcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Chapter 816 of the Laws of 1952 does not violate the requirements of the State Constitution (art. III, &sect; 15) inasmuch as chapter 816 embraces only one subject and its entire subject matter is expressed in its title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The references in said chapter 816 to the Town Law, to article 79 and section 1307 of the Civil Practice Act are not such an incorporation by reference as is prohibited by the State Constitution (art. III, &sect; 16).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers sought review of a decision of a Special Term of the Supreme Court, Ulster County (New York), which denied their motion for judgment on the pleadings and granted defendant state officials' cross motion for judgment on the pleadings in a suit seeking to declare 1954 N.Y. Laws 305, as amended by 1955 N.Y. Laws 864, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The law in question established a uniform jury system, but excepted all counties with a population of 1,000,000 or more and all counties with a population of less than 100,000. The taxpayers argued that this was a local law in violation of N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 17 and N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1(b). The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment below. The court noted that legislation is presumed to be constitutional. The population classification used was not novel or unusual, as there were a host of statutory provisions in New York law that differentiated between counties and cities of different sizes. The classifications were reasonable because similar laws would affect small, middle, and large-sized counties differently. The law created a true class, so it was a general law, not a local law, and did not violate N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 17, or N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment in favor of the state officials was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- special or general law -- jury systems -- three systems provided for selecting jurors: one system for 5 counties in City of New York, one system for about 15 other counties of 100,000 population or more, and one system which any of about 42 other counties of under 100,000 population may adopt if it does not wish second system (Judiciary Law, arts. 16, 17, 18); such legislative classification is reasonably suited to purpose of requiring uniform jury systems within economic capacities of three</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> classes of counties, and is not &quot;private&quot; or &quot;local&quot; or &quot;special&quot; but valid (L. 1954, ch. 305, as amd. by L. 1955, ch. 864; N. Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 17; art. IX, &sect; 1, subd. [b]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Legislature has established one system for selecting, drawing, summoning and empaneling jurors in counties within cities having a population of 1,000,000 or more, that is, in the 5 counties within the City of New York (L. 1940, ch. 202 [Judiciary Law, art. 17, and related statutes]); and another system for all other counties having a population of 100,000 or more (L. 1954, ch. 305 [Judiciary Law, art. 18, and related statutes]), that is, for 15 counties, if one uses the 1950 census; and another system which may be optionally adopted by counties having a population of less than 100,000, that is, according to the 1950 census, 42 counties (L. 1955, ch. 864 [Judiciary Law, art. 16, and related statutes]); and, if any of such smaller counties fails to exercise such option, its jury system is to be the same as that required for the 15 medium-sized counties.  The classifications thus constructed by the Legislature are not arbitrary.  They are reasonably suited to the purpose of requiring uniform jury systems within the financial and economic capacities of the three classes of counties.  They are not &quot;private&quot; or &quot;local&quot; or &quot;special&quot;, but are &quot;general&quot; and valid (N. Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 17).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The 1954 legislation (L. 1954, ch. 305) was a proposed fundamental change in up-State jury systems, and was to go into effect on July 1, 1955, but was in turn fundamentally reshaped by the 1955 legislation (L. 1955, ch. 864, eff. July 1, 1955).  Each Legislature has this fundamental power of repealing or reshaping its predecessors' acts, where not restricted by the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. If there is some reasonable and possible basis for a legislative classification, it cannot be held to be special and unconstitutional, but must be given effect by the courts.  The class created by the 1955 Legislature -- counties of less than 100,000 population -- was based on economic and financial conditions which could be recognized as possibly common to all counties in that class and reasonably related to the subject of the legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Since the statute under consideration is not local in its terms or effect, assuming, without deciding, that the statute is a law relating to the organization and government of counties, it is not violative of section 1 (subd. [b]) of article IX of the Constitution, which provides that the Legislature may not enact a law which is local in its terms or effect where the subject relates to the organization and government of counties.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner horse owner originally appealed a decision of respondents Racing Commission of the State of New York denying his application for an owner's racing license pursuant to the State Racing Commission Act &sect; 9-b(2), 1951 N.Y. Laws 324. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed a trial court order annulling the commission's determination. The commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner originally sought to set aside the denial of his application for a license because the denial was based on improper proof and was voided by procedural errors. The commission appealed after the appellate division affirmed an order setting aside the commission's action. The court held that there was no applicable hearing requirement, either statutory or implied, and that the commission had no power to reaffirm an act of a prior agency which had been found to lack jurisdiction to enter an order. However, disagreeing with the appellate court, it held that the commission was entitled to consider evidence obtained in connection with prior hearings because it was entitled to rely upon any facts, regardless of source, so long as they were trustworthy and reliable. The court also found that even though there were procedural irregularities in the manner in which the hearing was held, the errors did not require remission to the commission, that the evidence was sufficient to support the commission's action, that further consideration by the commission was not necessary, and that the lower court orders voiding its action and remitting the matter to the commission were reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Holding that the horse owner's application for a license was properly denied, the court reversed the orders of the lower courts which had reversed the racing commission's order denying the application and dismissed the horse owner's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Licenses -- horse racing -- application for owner's racing license properly denied by State Racing Commission -- said commission not barred from considering evidence before joint board which, in prior proceeding, was found to be without jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After the Court of Appeals had annulled a determination denying petitioner an owner's racing license on the ground that the hearing board -- a joint board consisting of three members of the State Racing Commission and two stewards of The Jockey Club -- had no lawful existence ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Fink </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Cole</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 302 N. Y. 216), petitioner applied to appellant State Racing Commission for such a license. The license was properly denied by the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is no statutory or implied requirement for a hearing on petitioner's application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. But the State Racing Commission, operating under a new statute with new standards, cannot reaffirm a decision of the joint board which had been annulled on the ground that it was without jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. However, the commission was not barred from considering the reports, testimony and exhibits in its files which had been obtained in the prior proceeding. Under this class of licensing statute, all relevant information known to the commission must be considered and reconsidered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Since the record discloses that the commission found nonconformity with the statute and since petitioner was accorded representation by counsel before the full commission, errors, if any, in the administrative denial of the license without specific factual findings are not so prejudicial as to call for a remission to the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The evidence now before the court is more than sufficient to support the action taken by the commission.  The reconsideration and reaffirmation of the prior decision were additional acts unnecessary for a valid denial of the application.  </SPAN></P>

The section was thus made applicable to the 15 counties which had been excluded by the population limitation, but not to New York City, since the words of art, &quot;the proceeding upon the petition and notice&quot;, were retained.  Accordingly, section 292-b, as amended in 1955, does not apply to proceedings in New York City.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were convicted of conspiracy and book making. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) affirmed several of the convictions and reversed others. Defendants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support their convictions. The court agreed and reversed the convictions and remanded for a new trial. The court found that the evidence consisted primarily of the testimony of a special investigator who listened in on over 100 telephone conversations and identified defendants as possessing voices he heard. The court found that the voice identification was inadequate because there was no individual identification. The court held that this fell below the standard necessary to rebut the presumption of innocence and prove defendants' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also held that the evidence failed to show a conspiracy but only a series of disconnected transactions from which, at the most, inference of several conspiracies could be drawn. The court also held that the state failed to prove the corpus delicti of the crime of bookmaking because there was no showing that there were any horseraces, baseball games, or boxing matches on the days set forth in the indictment. In addition, the court found that there was no expert witness to explain the meaning of the jargon employed in the conversations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's convictions for conspiracy and book making and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - book-making and conspiracy - (1) judgments convicting defendants-appellants of book-making and conspiracy reversed and new trial ordered - (2) voices heard in tapped telephone conversations not sufficiently identified as defendants' - (3) evidence showed not single conspiracy but disconnected transactions - (4) no proof that on days set forth in indictment any races or games occurred or that names overheard were names of any horses or participants - (5) book-makers' jargon not explained to jury by any expert.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Judgments convicting nine defendants-appellants of book-making, and also convicting eight of them of conspiracy to commit book-making ( Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 580, 986), are reversed and a new trial ordered, for the following reasons.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The People's case rested on the testimony of a special investigator who listened in, pursuant to court orders, on over one hundred telephone conversations during some two weeks' time for six hours each day and then, three months later, identified the nine appellants and at least ten others as possessing voices he had thus heard.  The voices, except those of two appellants, were not previously known&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to him, and, while thus listening to many unfamiliar voices, he had been busily pencilling notes and recording the substance of the conversations. There was no individual identification of the voices but, rather, a collective or general description. His identification of appellants' voices fell below the standard necessary to prove their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The indictment charged a single conspiracy, but the evidence showed a series of disconnected transactions, from which, at most, inference might be drawn of several conspiracies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  It was not proved that on the days set forth in the indictment (a) any horse races were run, (b) the names mentioned in the conversations were the names of horses, (c) any such horses were entered or ran in races on such dates, (d) any baseball games were played on the dates designated, or (e) any boxing matches were staged on such dates or that the names heard in the conversations were the names of participants who engaged in such boxing matches. Thus the corpus delicti of the crime of book-making was not proved.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The People did not qualify any expert to explain to the jury the meaning of the jargon used by the telephone&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conversants. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of the State of New York challenged the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment of the trial court in favor of respondent milk producer holding that N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 64(2) was unconstitutional, invalid, and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The milk producer manufactured and sold, in 14 1/2-ounce containers, evaporated skimmed milk. N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 64(2) prohibited the sale in the state of evaporated, skimmed milk in containers containing less than 10 pounds. The milk producer brought an action claiming that the statute was unconstitutional because no reasonable basis existed for an absolute ban against evaporated skimmed milk. The trial court held, and the appellate court affirmed, that the statute was unconstitutional, finding that there was no rational ground for the arbitrary and unnecessary prevention of the sale of a wholesome food product for household use. The court affirmed the judgments below, holding that the property of a citizen including his right to sell nondeleterious substances could not be taken from him without rhyme or reason. The ostensible legislative purpose was to see to it that customers did not get evaporated skimmed milk when they were trying to buy evaporated whole milk. The prohibition of all evaporated skimmed milk products was, as matter of law, not a reasonable way of dealing with such confusion or possibility of confusion as the legislators might have found to exist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court affirming the trial court's finding that a state law prohibiting the sale of evaporated skimmed milk in containers containing less than 10 pounds was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - milk control - evaporated skimmed milk - (1) judgment declaring unconstitutional that part of Agriculture and Markets Law ( &sect; 64, subd. 2) which prohibited sale of evaporated skimmed milk unless in minimum 10-pound containers, proper; statute had effect of arbitrarily barring wholesome&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  product from retail sales - (2) if some shopkeepers, when asked for evaporated milk, sold evaporated skimmed milk, proper remedy was not total ban on retail sales - (3) plaintiff sustained burden of proof by showing that no reasonable basis existed for statutory ban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Subdivision 2 of section 64 of the Agriculture and Markets Law, insofar as it prohibits the sale of &quot;evaporated skimmed milk, except it be in containers or packages containing ten pounds * * * or more&quot;, amounts to an unreasonable and arbitrary prohibition against all sales at retail of a concededly wholesome, useful, and widely accepted product.  Judgment was properly granted declaring the above-quoted portion of the subdivision unconstitutional and void, in this action by a corporation which sells such product in 14 1/2-ounce sealed and sterilized containers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Plaintiff's containers were plainly labeled &quot;Evaporated Skimmed Milk&quot;, as required by the subdivision.  Defendant, the State Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets, showed that some shopkeepers nevertheless tried to sell some of his inspectors evaporated skimmed milk when they asked simply for evaporated milk. However, the legislative remedy - in effect&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  banning all retail sales of this useful product - was unreasonable and confiscatory.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Plaintiff has sustained the burden of proof by showing that no reasonable basis existed for an absolute ban against evaporated skimmed milk. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The people appealed the orders of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) that reversed the judgments of the county court that convicted defendants of the crimes of fraudulently obtaining and conspiring to obtain property for charitable or benevolent purposes in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 934, and conspiracy in violation of N.Y. Penal Law, &sect; 580 and dismissed the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants solicited funds on the streets of the city dressed in the habit or garb common to sisters or nuns. Each defendant was at all times in possession of a written certificate of authority to make collections on behalf of a religious corporation duly organized under the Religious Corporations Law. The jury found that the agreement between defendants and a religious corporation was that each defendant delivered $ 2.50 a day to the pastor and retained the rest of the collected funds as her personal property. Defendants were convicted of fraudulently obtaining and conspiring to obtain property for charitable or benevolent purposes in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 934. The indictments were dismissed by the appellate court on the ground that there was no evidence that defendants violated the provisions of the statute. The court reversed the appellate court and held that the funds obtained by defendants were ostensibly solicited for benevolent purposes in violation of &sect; 934. The court concluded that it would have been a contradiction in terms to hold that the object of the Christian religion, in its broadest connotation, was not benevolent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the orders of the appellate court that set aside defendants' conviction for fraudulently obtaining property for charitable purposes and ordered a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Each of the defendants solicited funds by sitting in a public place dressed in a nun's habit and holding a cup in which each received coins from the public.  Each had in her possession a certificate of authority to make collections on behalf of a duly organized religious corporation.  The jury found that under the agreement between them and the religious corporation each defendant delivered $2.50 a day to the pastor of the church and retained the rest of the collected funds as her personal property. By these acts defendants violated the Penal Law ( &sect; 934), which makes it a crime for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a person willfully, by a false writing or other false pretenses, to obtain any money for any alleged or pretended charitable or benevolent purpose.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Collections made for the purposes of the church, including payment of part of the salary of a pastor, would not be in violation of section 934.  However, here the main object of defendants' solicitation was their own financial gain, and there was a fraud upon the public.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The collections were for a pretended &quot;religious&quot; purpose, such purpose being included in a &quot;benevolent&quot; purpose.  The church purports to be a Christian church, and the objects of such an organization are primarily the spiritual health and welfare of mankind, which is a &quot;benevolent&quot; purpose.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, Commissioner of Motor Vehicles (commissioner), sought review of the decision from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which annulled the determination of the commissioner that had suspended the driver's license of respondent driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioner suspended the driver's license to operate a motor vehicle for habitual or persistent violations of the traffic laws and ordinances pursuant to N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 71(3). The appellate court annulled the determination. On appeal, the court reversed. The court stated that the administration of the traffic rules was left to the reasonable discretion of the administrative official. The court stated that the magistrate that convicted the driver of his last speeding violation had apprised the driver that he had enough points to fall within the definition of an habitual or persistent offender. Based on the record, the court stated that the determination of the commissioner was neither arbitrary nor capricious and found that the suspension was justified.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motor vehicles - suspension of license - habitual or persistent violations - warning that license may be suspended or revoked - (1) petitioner admitted six prior convictions for traffic violations; Commissioner of Motor Vehicles properly suspended petitioner's operator's license for &quot;habitual or persistent violation&quot; of traffic laws (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 71, subd. 3, par. [d] ) - (2) statute not unconstitutional for invalid delegation of legislative powers - (3) when petitioner had enough demerit points on last speeding violation to fall within commissioner's definition of &quot;habitual&quot; or &quot;persistent&quot; violator, Magistrate properly apprised respondent of provision of Code of Criminal Procedure&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (&sect; 335-a); license, therefore, properly suspended. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Petitioner admitted six prior convictions for traffic violations, and the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles suspended petitioner's license to operate a motor vehicle for fifteen days, pursuant to the Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect; 71, subd. 3, par. [d] ), which permits such suspension &quot;for habitual or persistent violation&quot; of traffic laws and ordinances. The commissioner's determination was improperly annulled and should be reinstated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect; 71, subd. 3, par. [d] ) is not unconstitutional on the claimed ground that legislative functions have been delegated to an administrative body without providing any criteria or standards definding the words &quot;habitual&quot; or &quot;persistent&quot;.  The circumstances under which a licensee may be deemed guilty of &quot;habitual or persistent violation&quot; vary with the changes in highway conditions, amount of traffic, type of control, power and speed of vehicles, changes in local traffic regulations and ordinances and other elements, necessitating the delegation of the formulation of specific rules to administrative officials.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  When petitioner was charged with speeding in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1952, he had two prior convictions against him for speeding and he had been found guilty of passing three red lights.  Under the commissioner's point system, there were seven points against petitioner at that time or one point short of finding him a &quot;habitual&quot; offender by the commissioner's definition.  Therefore, with the last violation, one of speeding, petitioner acquired two more points or enough to cause him to fall within the commissioner's definition of &quot;habitual&quot; or &quot;persistent&quot;, and, accordingly, the Magistrate had the discretion to suspend or revoke petitioner's license, and at that point it was necessary that the convicting Magistrate apprise petitioner of the provisions of section 335-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  The Magistrate did so at that time.  Accordingly, petitioner's license was properly suspended. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the nonpayment of water charges amounting to $887, the City of New York&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  acquired title to two parcels of real property assessed at $52,000, in an in rem foreclosure sale. The nonpayment of water charges was due to the default of a trusted bookkeeper and was discovered when he attempted suicide. One of the parcels of property had a gross annual rent income of $9,275, and the other parcel was resold at a price in excess of its assessed valuation of $6,000, the city retaining the entire sale proceeds of $7,000.  The owners paid the real estate taxes due on the property and the city continued to bill the owners for the real estate taxes on one of the parcels for two years after the city had acquired title. The court is without power to afford relief. The result suggests the need of legislation.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, New York State Conservation Commissioner and New York State Director of Lands and Forests, challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which granted a motion by respondent corporation for consent to institute an action against appellants pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation, a public interest group, sought to enjoin appellants from granting contracts for the cutting down and carrying away of blown down timber. The corporation claimed that the contracts violated N.Y. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1, which protected State forests. The corporation filed a motion for consent to institute an injunctive action against appellants. Appellants claimed that the corporation lacked standing because it was not a &quot;citizen&quot; within the meaning of N.Y. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 4. The trial court granted the corporation's motion. On appeal, the court modified the trial court's order and affirmed the order as modified. The court held that the corporation was a membership corporation and that such corporations were &quot;citizens&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 4. Therefore, the court determined that the corporation had standing to institute the action against appellants. The court ruled that the trial court's order erroneously granted the corporation the right to invoke all available remedies. The court modified the order by limiting it to consent to institute an action to enjoin a violation of N.Y. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the clerk was not a subordinate employee entitled to the protection of &sect; 22, as the clerk performed many vital tasks on his own responsibility that were not subject to the surrogate's direction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The theaters sought a declaratory judgment determining that the direction in the New York City Amusement Tax, enacted by Local Law No. 37 of 1954 of the City of New York, requiring the collection of an entire additional cent tax in instances where only half or a major fraction of a cent was due, was void. The trial court granted the city summary judgment and the appellate court reversed. The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and reinstated the judgment of the trial court. The court noted that the enabling act limited the amount of tax which could be charged by the city to five percent and that the result of the breakage was to require payment of more than five percent in some instances. The burden of paying the admissions tax fell upon theater patrons and the custom of paying an extra cent was found to have a de minimis impact on the patrons. The court concluded that the five percent tax was subject to the manner of handling breakage usual in commercial transactions. Section B32-5.0 of the Administrative Code, which prohibited charging an amount greater than the ticket price for tickets, did not preclude the future imposition of taxes pursuant to an enabling act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  New York City Local Law No. 37 of 1954 imposes a tax of 5% upon admission charges to certain places of amusement and provides that &quot;Where the tax to be paid by a patron includes a fraction of one cent, the fraction shall not be paid when it is less than one-half cent and a full cent shall be paid when the fraction is one-half cent or more&quot; (Administrative Code, &sect; G46-2.0 subd. d).

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  In deciding whether the doctrine of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de minimis non curat lex</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should be applied, the problem should be studied from the viewpoint of the purchaser of a theatre ticket.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  When the Legislature authorized municipalities to levy these taxes at 5%, it meant 5% subject to the manner of handling &quot;breakage&quot; which is usual in commercial transactions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Section B32-5.0 of the Administrative Code prohibiting the charging of more for a theatre ticket than the regular or established price, plus the amount of any tax imposed by the United States Government, was not intended to prohibit the levying or collection of taxes which might validly be levied upon admissions pursuant to law.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner media organizations brought a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding in the Supreme Court, New York County (New York) against respondent judge, who had entered an order excluding the public from attending a criminal trial. The lower appellate courts upheld the judge's order and denied petitioners' art. 78 application. Petitioners appealed, arguing that they had been entitled to compel the judge to open the trial to the public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the course of a criminal case, the judge excluded the public, including petitioners, from attendance at the trial. Petitioners brought a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding to enjoin the judge from enforcing his exclusionary order. On review, the intermediate appellate courts affirmed the judge's order. In defendant's appeal from his conviction, the court held that the judge's exclusionary order had deprived defendant of his right to a public trial. The issue in petitioners' appeal from the denial of their art. 78 petition was whether members of the public at large possessed an enforceable right to insist that defendant's trial be open to the public. The court held that petitioners were seeking to convert what was essentially the right of a particular accused into a privilege for every citizen, a privilege that the latter might have invoked independently of the rights of defendant. A consequence of petitioners' position would have been to permit defendant's rights to be determined in proceedings in which he was not a party and had no voice, as exemplified by the instant action. The decision upholding the denial of petitioners' application was thus affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In three separate prosecutions the People sought review by permission from orders of the County Court of St. Lawrence County (New York), which, in each instance, reversed a judgment that convicted each defendant of operating an automobile while intoxicated, a misdemeanor and violation of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While the informations were not dismissed in so many words, it was clear that no further proceedings were contemplated. The cases presented the same or similar questions of law, namely, whether the county court erred as a matter of law in discrediting the magistrate's return as to proceedings had on arraignment. On review the court found that the county court erred as a matter of law when it chose to credit the affidavits of error. In dealing with the appeals the county court was not faced with a problem of credibility, but with a consideration of such legal error as appeared in the magistrate's returns. It was without power to discredit them as filed. When defendants submitted their appeals without having previously pointed out wherein the return was defective, they were deemed to have admitted their sufficiency and correctness. No such application was made and the magistrate's return as filed in each case was conclusive as to all controverted matters within the magistrate's knowledge. A plea of guilty admitted the allegations of the information and rendered further proof of such allegations unnecessary and immaterial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant employer sought review by permission of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which, in an action for wages under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was employed as an inspector in the employer's factory. As a result of the operative collective bargaining agreement the employee was entitled to overtime for all work in excess of eight hours a day or 40 hours a week. The established workday was nine hours per day and five days per week. In order to vote, the employers designated the two hours immediately after the employee's performance of seven hours of work. The employee left the plant to vote, but he only received his normal compensation, not the overtime that he would have normally received. The employee filed suit. On review, the court found no error. The court held that the purpose of N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 226 was to eliminate any penalty for exercising the right of suffrage and to remove a practical obstacle to getting out the vote. The statute assured that, if the employee worked for seven hours and took off the two allowed him to vote, he should have been paid the amount he would have received had he not voted and had remained at his employment for his accustomed nine hours. The court rejected the employer's argument that the employee only should have received straight time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Under the collective bargaining agreement between plaintiff's labor union and his employer, plaintiff was entitled to $1.80 an hour for straight time and time and one half, or $2.70 an hour, for all work in excess of eight hours a day or forty hours a week.  In the week which included Election Day, the established workday at defendant employer's plant was nine hours a day and five days a week, which meant that plaintiff earned $17.10 a day.  Defendant designated the two hours immediately following plaintiff's performance of seven hours of work as the time to absent himself for voting on Election Day, and paid plaintiff $16.20, instead of the $17.10 which he ordinarily received.  The figure of $16.20 was arrived at by paying plaintiff at the rate of $1.80 an hour for the two additional voting hours.  Summary judgment was properly granted in plaintiff's favor in the sum of ninety cents.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The provision of the Election Law (&sect; 226) that a person shall be entitled to absent himself on Election Day from his employment for two successive hours and that no deduction shall be made from the usual salary or wages of such voter and no other penalty shall be imposed upon him by his employer by reason of such absence, guarantees the employee against any loss in compensation by reason of his taking time off to vote.  He is assured that, if he takes the time off to vote, he will be paid the amount he would have received if he had not voted, but had remained at his employment for the accustomed time.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The statute was not intended to entitle plaintiff only to his usual hourly rate of wages - straight time as distinguished from overtime. Such an interpretation of the statute would discriminate against workers employed at an hourly rate rather than by the day or week.  That was not the legislative intent, and there is no constitutional objection to the construction whereby plaintiff is paid time and one half.  </SPAN></P>

At that time section 464 (subd. [2] ) of the Charter of the City of Buffalo provided that members of the police department were entitled to pensions &quot;after twenty years of actual service in said department&quot;.Such provision&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was repealed by Local Law No. 8 adopted June 30, 1940, and in substitution therefor it was enacted that any member who had completed thirty years of actual service should be entitled to a pension. The &quot;thirty years&quot; was reduced to &quot;twenty-five years&quot; by Local Law No. 1 of 1945.  Petitioner applied for retirement in September, 1952, effective October 1, 1952, thus having served as a patrolman for a period of twenty-two years.  His application for a service pension was rejected, and he is still serving as patrolman. An application for an order directing respondents, as members of the board of police pensions of the City of Buffalo, to grant petitioner's application for retirement, effective October 1, 1952, and a pension, was properly denied.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The twenty-year clause, as it existed in section 464 of the Charter of the City of Buffalo in 1930 when petitioner entered the police department, did not constitute a vested contractual interest inuring to petitioner's benefit, and it could be constitutionally altered in 1940 and 1945 when the length of time required in which to entitle him to a pension was increased from twenty to thirty years and then reduced to twenty-five years.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3.  Prior to the addition of section 7 of article V to the State Constitution in 1938, providing that after July 1, 1940, membership in any public retirement system shall be a contractual relationship, the benefits of which shall not be diminished or impaired, it was held in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Roddy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Valentine</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (268 N.Y. 228) that a policeman obtained a vested right to his pension upon his retirement, and that prior thereto no such contractual right inhered in a member of a pension fund. The court stated: &quot;Where the statutory scheme creates a fund wholly or largely out of public moneys, the interest of the member down to the point where there has been compliance with all precedent conditions and the award has been or as of right should have been made, can hardly be deemed contractual.&quot; Assuming that prior to 1940 the members of the police pension fund of the City of Buffalo paid about one third of its annual receipts while the city subscribed the remaining two thirds, as petitioner contends, the first clause of the quoted language in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Roddy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Valentine</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, on which petitioner relies herein, was dictum that the interest of the member was noncontractual &quot;Where the statutory scheme creates&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a fund wholly or largely out of public moneys&quot;.  There was no need, and it was not intended, thereby to define precisely under what circumstances a policeman might obtain a contractual right if the retirement plan differed from the customary and purported to grant such a right.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Even if petitioner did, along with other members of the fund, pay a substantial sum in comparison to that contributed by the city, no unconstitutionality would appear to be involved in changing the provisions of the pension requirements prior to July 1, 1940 (N.Y. Const., art. V, &sect; 7), since a means was supplied under section 462 of the Charter of the City of Buffalo, as amended, to refund to a member, who resigned from the fund, the moneys he had himself paid in.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Even if the language of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Roddy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Valentine</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was to be adopted as a precise criterion, it could not be held that the Buffalo police pension fund was created mainly out of private contributions when, even according to petitioner's contention, at no time was more than one third contributed privately by the members of the fund.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant property owners sought review of an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which reversed a lower court's summary judgment dismissing the complaint in favor of defendant in plaintiff water regulating district's action seeking the enforcement of a plan to construct a reservoir.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff water regulating district filed an action for a judgment declaring it entitled to maintain condemnation proceedings against defendant property owners for the purpose of constructing a reservoir.

The court concluded that &sect; 445 effectively disposed of the plan, as it only excepted the construction of a reservoir for the purpose of a municipal water supply, which was not the situation in the instant case. The court noted that plaintiff's authority was revocable by legislation and that such did not create an impairment of rights or render the legislation constitutionally invalid. The court held that plaintiff lacked the status to challenge the law because it was a government agency, and plaintiff's authority had been constitutionally withdrawn.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The so-called Stokes Act (L. 1950, ch. 803, eff. April 20, 1950, amdg. Conservation Law, &sect; 445) prohibits the construction of &quot;reservoirs for the regulation of the flow of streams or for any other purpose except for municipal water supply * * * on the south branch of the Moose river by any river regulating board&quot;.  In November, 1953, the People adopted the so-called Ostrander Amendment to the State Constitution (art. XIV, &sect; 2, eff. Jan. 1, 1954), canceling and withdrawing the prior constitutional exception permitting the Legislature to allow a portion of the State Forest Preserve to be used for the construction of reservoirs to regulate the flow of streams (art. XIV, &sect;&sect; 1, 2), so that the People have rendered the lands of the State Forest Preserve inviolate for use in regulating the flow of streams. Plaintiff Black River Regulating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  District and the individual plaintiffs, for themselves and as members of the regulating district board, instituted this action for judgment declaring that the regulating district was entitled to maintain condemnation proceedings against defendant and that the Stokes Act, in its application to the proposed plan to construct the Panther Mountain Reservoir and Dam, was invalid.  Special Term dismissed the complaint.  The Appellate Division, stating that, since the Court of Appeals in the previous case ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Adirondack League Club </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Black Riv. Regulating Dist.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 301 N.Y. 219) had not passed on the constitutionality of the Stokes Act, reversed the order dismissing the complaint and held, as a matter of law, that, if the constitutional invalidity of the Stokes Act was established, &quot;the issues which were rendered moot by the passage of the Stokes Act would be no longer moot&quot;.  The Stokes Act is declared constitutional.  Plaintiffs, either as a body politic or as individuals, lack status to challenge its validity, and, in such capacities, are barred from maintaining condemnation proceedings. The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the matter remitted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the parties hereto were previously before the court (301 N.Y. 219, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), the Court of Appeals ruled that, since the reservoir planned by the board was not &quot;for municipal water supply&quot;, and since no construction had actually been commenced, the Stokes Act completely disposed of the board's plan.  The Court of Appeals did not reach the merits or deem it a situation requiring special treatment and, at the same time, declined to pass upon the constitutionality of the Stokes Act as such question was not then before it.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  While the Stokes Act and the Ostrander Amendment became effective subsequent to the approval of the proposed reservoir project, they nonetheless enunciated a public policy concerning the use of the lands in the State Forest Preserve in order to make sure that such lands should be &quot;forever kept as wild forest lands&quot;.  The issue should be decided in accord with the law as it exists when the decision of the Court of Appeals is made, a policy which is in harmony with Federal authority and with the unwillingness of the court to perpetuate a judgment contrary to existing law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The withdrawal by the Ostrander Amendment of the board's legislative authority&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to use lands of the State Forest Preserve &quot;to regulate the flow of streams&quot; is not in any way limited to prospective effect, nor may its effectiveness be suspended or postponed by plaintiffs' claim of a so-called vested right to proceed to construction because of prior approval of its official plan.  That plan was effectively disposed of by the Stokes Act (see 301 N.Y. 219, 222, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The number and nature of the powers of a regulating district, an agency of the State to promote the public health, safety and welfare, are within the absolute discretion of the State, and any alteration or impairment of those powers by the Legislature presents no question of constitutionality. Such powers are not protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  The district board is no more than an agency of the State, notwithstanding that plaintiffs maintain it was voluntarily formed.  The nature of the district is voluntary only to the extent that a person or public corporation may petition the State Water Power and Control Commission for its organization, but it is the order of said commission which creates the district (Conservation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Law, &sect;&sect; 432, 435).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  The inclusion of Panther Mountain Reservoir in the official plan did not vest in plaintiffs, per se, a contractual interest either in the proposed site or in the construction of a reservoir which could not be impaired by legislative action.  Inherent in the grant of legislative power is a plenary power to alter or revoke, and the exercise of such power does not impair any obligation of contract.  Actually there is only one party to a contract by which a governmental corporation is formed, and its board of directors are only trustees for the common good.  Accordingly, the interests of plaintiffs are only those of the State, and the State cannot challenge its own acts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.  The issuance of certificates of indebtedness by plaintiffs does not confer upon them an independent status to test the validity of the Stokes Act or to protect the interests of the creditors of the district.  Whatever contract the certificate holders may have with the district is subject to legitimate governmental power exercised on behalf of the public welfare.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A trust was created under the will of a deceased person, which expressed a charitable purpose of educating children of the poor through an academy.

The trial court held that the trust terminated and that the next of kin of the testator were entitled to the trust. The successor trustees appealed.

The court held that the entire applicable portion of the will was to be read and considered, and not merely isolated segments, and the intent was to be gleaned from that complete consideration.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Decedent died in 1841 leaving a will in which, stating his &quot;desire to raise the standard of intellectual and moral improvement among the poor&quot;, he created a trust in perpetuity for the &quot;exclusive education of the children of the poor&quot; and placed the sum of $6,000 in trust for a &quot;perpetual fund for the education of the children of the poor who shall be educated in the academy in the village of Huntington&quot;.  Testator then stated that the principal of the fund should be loaned on bond secured by mortgage, and one half of the interest annually accruing should be added to the principal until the whole fund amounted to $10,000, the other one half of the interest to be applied to the &quot;education of the children of the poor&quot;, and, when the whole fund amounted to $10,000, then the whole interest of the fund should be applied to the &quot;education of the poor in the academy in the village of Huntington&quot;.  Then followed other provisions to insure the application of the fund to testator's purpose.  Said academy, of which testator was one of the founders in about 1793, was a private educational institution.  It continued to function until&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1858 when appellant Union Free School District No. 3 of the Town of Huntington purchased the academy and the land on which it stood, tore down the building, and erected a new school building on such land and adjoining land.In this construction proceeding commenced in 1949 by successor trustees, it was erroneously determined that the trust failed when the academy was absorbed into the common school system.  The matter is remitted to the Surrogate's Court.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Insofar as some of the present litigants succeed to the interests of parties in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Williams </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Williams</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (8 N.Y. 525 [1853] ), which concerned the precise trust involved in the present case, they are foreclosed from relitigating issues decided in that case.  Appellants, Attorney-General and Union Free School District No. 3 of the Town of Huntington, who apparently were not represented in court in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Williams</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case, are not precluded from litigating any issues here.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  In the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Williams</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case, the Court of Appeals did not hold that this trust for education was limited in time to the period of existence of a particular institution.  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Williams</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case did hold that charitable trusts had not been abolished by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Revised Statutes.  The State Legislature in 1893 approved of that rule by enacting the so-called Tilden Act (L. 1893, ch. 701, now Personal Property Law, &sect; 12).  That conclusion of legislative approval is further strengthened by the fact that in 1870 the Legislature enacted chapter 306 for the specific purpose of empowering the Union Free School District of the Town of Huntington to receive funds from the trust set up by the testator, if the trustees wished to give them.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Inasmuch as the facts are not in dispute, testator's intention in creating the trust for the children of the poor is a question of law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Giving the terms of the will a liberal construction and considering the entire applicable portion of the will and not merely isolated segments, testator intended to provide a never-ending source of financial aid to needy students without limiting that charitable purpose of the funds to the lifetime of any specific institution.  There are seven references in the will to children of the poor and their education, and testator qualified such references by the mention of the academy on but two occasions.  Testator referred to &quot;children&quot; and to the &quot;education of children&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on thirteen different occasions, while the academy was mentioned by name but five times, and only two of those times were instances from which respondents might draw their conclusion that this trust was limited to the lifetime of the academy. Testator indicated on at least three occasions that he intended that the trust should be &quot;perpetual.&quot; He also indicated that, if the academy burned, the funds were to be used at the school next west of the academy. While such references to the academy are such that the more reasonable conclusion is that testator hoped and expected that the education of the needy children would be at the academy rather than elsewhere, the court cannot say, as a matter of law, that the language of the will must be construed to mean that the continued existence of the academy was to be a condition precedent to the continued education of the children of the poor from this fund.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  The courts below have held that testator was not motivated by a general charitable intent and, therefore, found it unnecessary to determine any other question.  Since the court determines that testator did have such a general charitable intent, the case must be sent back to the Surrogate's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Court for the determination of other issues, if any, not previously passed upon, and also the question as to what purposes the trust funds shall now be put.  </SPAN></P>

The tenants refused to sign. The tenants filed an petition to enjoin the resolution's enforcement.

The appellate division modified the order and dismissed the proceedings because later governmental actions cured the due process question. The court decided the case on nonconstitutional grounds and remanded it for further proceedings. The court determined that courts would not decide constitutional issues unless it was necessary, that evidence suggested that the tenant's housing was not built under the U.S. Housing Act, and that the list of organizations included groups that had not been designated as subversive by the attorney general.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A provision of the Independent Offices Appropriations Act of 1953 (66 U.S. Stat. 403), known as the Gwinn Amendment, provided that &quot;no housing unit constructed under the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, shall be occupied by a person who is a member of an organization designated as subversive by the Attorney General&quot;, and provided further that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;the foregoing prohibition shall be enforced by the local housing authority&quot;.  The New York City Housing Authority adopted a resolution providing that &quot;No applicant shall be admitted to, and no tenant shall be permitted to continue to reside in * * * a federally-aided project&quot; unless the applicant or tenant has signed a certificate to the effect that neither he nor any other occupant of the unit &quot;is a member of an organization designated as subversive by the Attorney General&quot;.  Petitioner, who lives in the Williamsburg Houses Project, was requested by the Authority to sign a certificate entitled &quot;Certification of Nonmembership in Subversive Organizations&quot;, reading as follows: &quot;I hereby certify that I am not a member of any of the organizations listed in the document entitled 'Consolidated List, Dated November 10, 1952, of Organizations Designated by the Attorney General of the United States As Within Executive Order No. 9835', attached hereto&quot;.  The list attached to the certificate set forth the names of 194 organizations.  The petition in the present proceeding alleges that the action of the Authority violates the rights of the petitioner guaranteed by the Federal Constitution in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  five enumerated respects and that the Authority's action is arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable.  Interveners allege that they are tenants of the Authority residing in either the Red Hook Housing Project or the Kingsboro Housing Project, and assert that they are members of the International Workers Order, an organization cited by the Attorney General.  An order dismissing the proceeding should be reversed and the matter remitted to Special Term.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Although the Gwinn Amendment speaks only of housing units &quot;constructed under the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended&quot;, the Authority has applied the amendment to any </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">&quot;federally-aided project&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a term defined in a resolution of the Authority as &quot;any project of the Authority receiving financial assistance from the Federal Government or any project leased by the Authority from the Federal Government.&quot; The record does not show that Williamsburg Houses Project was &quot;constructed under&quot; the Housing Act.  It should not be determined whether the Authority may, consistent with the Constitution, evict petitioner for failure to sign the requested certificate, if the Gwinn Amendment did not empower the Authority to require such a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  certificate from tenants or occupants of Williamsburg Houses.  The case should be remitted to Special Term so that the facts and the law may be developed and to determine whether the Williamsburg Housing Project is, in fact, encompassed by the Gwinn Amendment, or whether there was some other source of power for the action of the Authority.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The Gwinn Amendment excludes from such units only persons who are members of an &quot;organization designated as subversive by the Attorney General&quot;.  When Congress enacted the Gwinn Amendment, the Attorney General had been furnishing the Loyalty Review Board of the United States Civil Service Commission with a list of organizations, and in compiling that list had broken it down into six distinct and separate classes, only one of which was entitled &quot;subversive&quot;.  Although the list attached to the certificate which petitioner was asked to sign contained the names of 194 organizations, only twelve had been designated as &quot;subversive&quot; when the Gwinn Amendment was passed, and only thirteen had been so named by the time the Authority moved to enforce it.  Congress may have intended to refer only to those organizations specifically designated by the Attorney&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General as &quot;subversive&quot;.  There was no showing in the record that a tenant, reading the list, had any way of discerning which were the organizations designated by the Attorney General as &quot;subversive&quot;.  Until there is some showing that the Authority was empowered to do what the record suggests it did, it would be improper and unwise to determine whether or not the Gwinn Amendment or the action of the Authority taken under it was constitutional.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Petitioner has pleaded and relied almost exclusively on provisions of the Federal Constitution.  Accordingly, upon remission, if the court at Special Term concludes that the Authority exceeded its statutory powers, it should also consider whether it might not be more appropriate to dismiss the petition than to grant the relief sought.  In that event, it is for Special Term to consider, in the first instance, what effect the dismissal of the original petition would have on the intervening petitioners.  </SPAN></P>

The court noted that in the absence of proof before the court that the reapportionment challenged was arbitrary and based on personal and political considerations and not on the convenience of the voters or any factor relating to the public interest, and the lines were drawn with the purpose of assuring the continuous election of the candidates of one particular political party and the control of such respective districts by particular political leaders, and in the absence of proof that territory within the districts as reapportioned was not convenient, contiguous and in as compact form as practicable, the court concluded, that the apportionment was not improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, who were nonsigners of plaintiff companies' free trade agreements, appealed three decisions of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed judgments in favor of plaintiffs in their actions to enjoin defendants from selling plaintiffs' fair traded products for less than their stipulated minimum prices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants in three separate cases were nonsigners of plaintiffs' fair trade agreements, and plaintiffs obtained injunctions to prevent defendants from selling fair traded products at less than their stipulated minimum prices. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendants' attack on the Feld-Crawford Fair Trade Law, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect;369-a, was unavailing. The delegation of power and due process arguments were disposed of by an earlier decision of the court, and were no longer open to question. Defendants' economic and policy arguments as to the doubtful wisdom of fair trade laws were properly addressed to the legislature. No equal protection violation was shown because contrary to defendants' assertion, the statute created no unreasonable or arbitrary discrimination against low cost, minimum service retailers. The Maguire Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 45, which exempted fair trade agreements from federal antitrust laws, did not give the states power over interstate commerce that was denied them under the Constitution. Congress could redefine the distribution of power over interstate commerce, and it could permit states to regulate commerce in a manner that would otherwise not be permissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgments in favor of plaintiffs that enjoined defendants from selling plaintiffs' fair traded products for less than their stipulated minimum prices.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade-marks, trade names and unfair competition - fair trade laws - constitutionality of application of State Fair Trade Law to sales in or affecting interstate commerce pursuant to Federal permissive statute - (1) retailers whose transactions directly or indirectly involve interstate commerce properly enjoined under Feld-Crawford Fair Trade Law ( General Business Law, &sect; 369-a et seq.) from selling manufacturers' products at less than minimum prices stipulated in fair trade agreements of which they were nonsignatories - (2) Maguire Act (66 U.S. Stat. 632) exempting from Federal antitrust laws agreements made pursuant to State fair trade laws and permitting their enforcement against nonsigners engaged in interstate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  commerce does not give States unconstitutional power over interstate commerce; Federal statute makes no distinction between sales &quot;in&quot; and those &quot;affecting&quot; interstate commerce - (3) not necessary that State statute be re-enacted - (4) State statute does not deny equal protection of laws; no arbitrary discrimination against low-cost, minimum service retailers; statute is reasonable regulation under police power - (5) State statute not unconstitutional delegation of legislative power nor deprivation of property without due process of law - (6) economic arguments as to wisdom of fair trade laws should be addressed to Legislature - (7) manufacturers' fair trade agreements complied with requirements of State Fair Trade Law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Retailers whose transactions directly or indirectly involve interstate commerce and who are nonsigners of manufacturers' fair trade agreements, were properly enjoined, under the Feld-Crawford Fair Trade Law ( General Business Law, &sect; 369-a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) from selling the manufacturers' fair traded products at less than their stipulated minimum prices.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The Maguire Act (66 U.S. Stat. 632) which exempts from the operation of Federal antitrust laws fair trade&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  agreements made pursuant to existing or future State laws and which permits their enforcement against nonsigners engaged in interstate commerce, does not give the States power over interstate commerce denied them under the Federal Constitution.  The distinction between commerce, primarily local, which indirectly affects interstate commerce, and that which is directly of national concern, is drawn merely to determine the extent of State power in areas where Congress by silence has allowed its own power to remain dormant.  Such distinction does not operate to restrict the power of a State acting under an express grant from Congress.  Moreover, the Maguire Act makes no distinction between sales &quot;affecting&quot; and sales directly &quot;in&quot; interstate commerce but was, rather, designed to apply to commodities, contracts and activities in or affecting interstate commerce. &quot;Compulsion&quot; against nonsigners of fair trade agreements, expressly authorized by Congress, does not transgress any constitutional prohibition.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The Feld-Crawford Act was previously held to apply to nonsigners engaged in interstate commerce and, although such application was later declared unconstitutional by the United States&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Supreme Court, the subsequent passage of the Maguire Act removed the barrier to complete interstate application of the State statute.  Under such circumstances the Constitution does not require that the State statute be re-enacted in order to be effective.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The New York Fair Trade Law does not create any unreasonable or arbitrary discrimination against low-cost, minimum service retailers and does not deny equal protection of the laws in violation of both Federal and State Constitutions.  It is wholly inapplicable to unmarked goods and, as to marked goods, merely permits a manufacturer to prevent retailers from impairing the value of its trade-mark and good will by selling its identified products at unreasonably low prices.  Moreover, the statute constitutes a reasonable regulation under the police power. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The State statute does not constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative powers to private persons in violation of the State Constitution (N.Y. Const., art. III, &sect; 1), nor a deprivation of property without due process of law in violation of both Federal and State Constitutions.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Bourjois Sales Corp. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Dorfman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 273 N.Y. 167, followed.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  Economic and policy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arguments concerning the wisdom of fair trade legislation are properly addressed to the Legislature.  Such arguments, alone, do not provide sufficient reason for the court to reopen settled constitutional issues.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  The separate fair trade contracts of the manufacturers involved here complied with that portion of the statute ( General Business Law, &sect; 369-a) which sanctions such contracts between &quot;vendor&quot; and &quot;buyer&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court modified a pro forma order fixing an estate tax, thereby increasing the tax amount.

XVI, &sect; 5), which subjects to taxation salaries and other compensation &quot;except pensions&quot; paid to public officers was intended to except pensions from income tax and does not forbid estate tax on retirement allowance payable to decedent's wife; nor is such taxation invalidated by Constitution (art. V, &sect; 7), stating that, after July 1, 1940, membership in public retirement system shall be contractual relationship, benefits of which shall not be diminished, since estate tax, as applicable to retirement benefits, was in effect before 1940 - (3) decedent, when he chose option 3, made to his wife &quot;a transfer * * * intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death&quot;, which transfer was includible in his gross estate (Tax Law, &sect; 249-r, subd. 3) - (4) appraiser was correct when he accepted valuation of $8,572, made by Superintendent of Insurance (Tax Law, &sect; 249-v), of property right which came to widow at decedent's death.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Decedent, upon retirement in 1936 from his employment with the City of New York, made, pursuant to what is now the New York City Administrative Code (&sect; B3-46.0), an irrevocable election of &quot;Option 3&quot; in respect&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to retirement benefits payable by the New York City employees' retirement system, of which he was a member.  Said option 3 provided him a retirement allowance of $3,140.60 for his life and, after his death, provided his wife a retirement allowance for her life of $1,570.20.  When he died in 1947, his executrix filed a New York estate tax report in which she valued the retirement benefits at &quot;0&quot;.  The tax appraiser, and the Surrogate in his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">pro forma</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taxing order, included in the gross estate for tax purposes, as a transfer taking effect at decedent's death, the widow's retirement allowance, valuing it at $8,572 in accordance with a certificate of valuation thereof made by the Superintendent of Insurance for the appraiser under the Tax Law ( &sect; 249-v).  That $8,572 represented, according to the appropriate tables, the calculated present value, as of decedent's death, of a life annuity to the widow, then seventy-three years old, of $1,570.20 per year.  On appeal from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">pro forma</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> order, the Surrogate modified the order by excluding from the gross estate any value for the widow's retirement allowance, on the ground that, although the widow's allowance was &quot;a transfer * * * intended&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his [the decedent's] death&quot; (Tax Law, &sect; 249-r, subd. 3), the State Constitution (art. XVI, &sect; 5) forbade taxation of it since it was a &quot;pension&quot;.  The modification by the Surrogate was improper, and the appraiser's inclusion in the gross estate of the widow's retirement allowance, valuing it at $8,572, was correct. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The State Constitution (art. XVI, &sect; 5) does not forbid taxing this retirement allowance. When the 1938 Constitutional Convention adopted said section 5, making subject to taxation all salaries and other compensation &quot;except pensions&quot; paid to public officers and employees, it was putting into the Constitution the already existing statutory law that public officers and employees had to pay income taxes on their earnings and added, out of caution, the word &quot;pensions&quot; to make sure that pensions would not be subject to income tax.  When, in 1938, section 7 of article V of the State Constitution was adopted, making membership in a public retirement system after July 1, 1940, a contractual relationship, the benefits of which were not to be impaired, retirement benefits were already subject to estate taxes by reason&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Tax Law ( &sect; 249-kk) which was passed in 1930.  In 1947, the Civil Service Law ( &sect; 91) confirmed and continued the taxability of retirement benefits by the estate tax. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Decedent, when he chose option 3, made to his wife &quot;a transfer * * * intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death&quot; which transfer was includible in his gross estate (Tax Law, &sect; 249-r, subd. 3).  Decedent could have decided to use up his retirement benefits by electing a $3,747.69 retirement allowance for himself, but instead he accepted for his life a lesser retirement allowance of $3,141.60, plus an agreement by the retirement system to pay his widow $1,570.20 per year after his death, should she survive.  Thus, decedent, in effect, created an annuity for his widow to take effect at his death.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The appraiser was correct in accepting the valuation made by the Superintendent of Insurance under the Tax Law ( &sect; 249-v, which says such valuation is &quot;conclusive&quot;) of the property right which came to the widow at decedent's death.  At his death the appropriate tables showed that the present value of $1 per year for the life of a person aged seventy-three (like decedent's widow) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was $5.45928, which, multiplied by the $1,570.20 retirement allowance, made a value of $8,572.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner teachers sought review of orders entered by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed orders of the trial court that denied the teachers' application for an order directing respondents, boards of education, to annul the teachers' dismissal from their positions and to reinstate them without prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teachers appeared before a Senate subcommittee and refused to answer questions regarding Communist party membership, basing the refusal upon the privilege against self-incrimination. The boards of education terminated the teachers' employment and declared their positions vacant pursuant to the New York City, N.Y., City Charter &sect; 903, which provided for the vacatur of an office or employment if, while appearing before a legislative committee, an employee of the city willfully refused to answer any question regarding the property, government, or affairs of the city on the ground that his answer would tend to incriminate him. The teachers commenced two proceedings challenging their terminations. The trial court concluded that &sect; 903 applied and that it had been violated by the teachers. The appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: 1) &sect; 903 was applicable to a hearing before a federal legislative committee; and 2) the teachers were employees of the city and therefore subject to the provisions of &sect; 903.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Petitioners, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  teachers in public schools and public colleges of the City of New York, in answer to subpoenas, appeared at a hearing before a committee of the United States Senate investigating the administration of the Internal Security Act and other internal security laws, and refused to answer a question whether each of them was presently or had ever been a member of the Communist party.  Petitioners based such refusal upon the privilege against self incrimination (U.S. Const., 5th Amendt.).  Resolutions of the board of education and of the board of higher education of the City of New York, which, pursuant to section 903 of the New York City Charter, terminated petitioners' employment and declared their positions vacant, were valid.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 903 of the New York City Charter provides that if any &quot;employee&quot; of the City of New York, who, having appeared before &quot;any legislative committee * * *&quot; shall refuse to testify or to answer any question regarding the property, government or affairs of the city or regarding the &quot;official conduct&quot; of any employee of the city on the ground that his answer would tend to incriminate him, his term of employment shall terminate and his employment be vacant. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under this section, the assertion of the privilege against self incrimination is equivalent to a resignation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  There is no conflict between section 903 of the charter and the equally valid though differing procedures under the Feinberg Law (L. 1949, ch. 360) and under sections 2554, 2573 and 6206 of the Education Law, which guarantee to teachers the right to hold their respective positions during good behavior and efficient and competent service and not to be removed except for cause after a hearing by the affirmative vote of the majority of the board.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The Communist party is a continuing conspiracy against our Government; and an inquiry into past and present membership in the Communist party is an inquiry regarding the &quot;official conduct&quot; of an employee of the City of New York.  Loyalty to our Government goes to the very heart of official conduct in service rendered in all branches of Government; and communism is opposed to such loyalty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Section 903 of the charter is applicable to a hearing before a Federal legislative committee. The language in section 903 reading &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">any</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> legislative committee, or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">any</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officer, board or body authorized to conduct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">any</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or inquiry&quot; was not intended to except a legislative committee of the United States.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Petitioners are employees of the City of New York.  While the educational affairs of each city are under the general management and control of the board of education, such board is subject to municipal control in matters not strictly educational or pedagogic. Moreover, the State has power to determine what shall constitute a vacatur of public employment, and, in enacting statutes, to define terms used therein as in its wisdom it sees fit.  Thus, the Legislature has said, in the New York City Administrative Code (&sect; 981-1.0, subd. 7), that &quot;Any person whose salary in whole or in part is paid out of the city treasury&quot; is an employee of the city; and petitioners, as teachers, were so paid.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  That, at the times the New York City Charter was approved and became effective, the Legislature may not have had in mind the specific purpose for which section 903 is now being used, is immaterial, for section 903 protects the people of the city and the chartered municipalities of the State from dangers encompassed by the language of the statute, even though the precise danger may not have been envisioned&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at the moment of passage.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Nassau County Court (New York), which affirmed a judgment convicting defendant of violating an ordinance prohibiting through or transient traffic in a certain area and declared unconstitutional that portion of the ordinance prohibiting transient traffic.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of violating an ordinance prohibiting through or transient vehicular traffic within a certain area while taking a fellow employee home after work to a location one and one-half blocks west of the area. Defendant challenged the ordinance on the ground that it was not a valid exercise of any power delegated to the town by the state. The ordinance was allegedly adopted as a result of complaints from residents who objected to the volume of traffic caused mainly by employees of a particular company. Reversing, the court held that under N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 54, residents of a particular area did not possess and could not be granted proprietary rights to the use of highways therein in priority to or exclusive of use by the general public. The court found that such power was not conferred upon town or village boards by &sect; 90, either. Therefore, the ordinance was unconstitutional as a whole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the lower court's judgment and dismissed the information against defendant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal corporations - prohibition against through traffic - validity of ordinance - (1) ordinance adopted by town and forbidding &quot;through or transient vehicular traffic&quot; in designated area in town or village, invalid - (2) streets are for benefit of all people - (3) authority to prohibit through traffic not delegated to local authorities (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect;&sect; 54, 90, subds. 4, 5) - (4) elimination of word &quot;transient&quot; would not validate ordinance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A town ordinance forbade all &quot;through or transient&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vehicular traffic&quot; in a designated area in or near a village and evidently had no purpose other than to reserve the streets in such area for the benefit of the residents of the area as against a large number of employees of a nearby plant.  No arterial &quot;through&quot; highway or substitute was designated; nor was it shown that any physically suitable alternate route existed which could be so designated. This ordinance was an unreasonable exercise of the power to regulate traffic and was in excess of local power.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Political subdivisions and municipal corporations hold the fee of streets for the benefit of all the people.  Streets are subject exclusively to regulation and control by the State except insofar as the Legislature has delegated power to the local authorities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect; 54) stated that, except as otherwise provided, local authorities had no power to pass ordinances excluding people from the free use of public highways. Local authorities were authorized to make various types of traffic ordinances (&sect; 90) and &quot;In addition * * * and subject to the restrictions hereinafter provided * * * to make * * * such additional reasonable ordinances * * * as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  special local conditions may require,&quot; (subd. 4) but they had no power to pass any ordinance inconsistent with the provisions of the Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect; 90).  This ordinance was not such an additional, reasonable one.  The power to enact this ordinance does not parallel any of the other powers granted in section 90.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The elimination of the word &quot;transient&quot; would not change the scope of the ordinance or serve to validate it.  </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court dismissing the charge for lack of proof. The court also held that the statute was constitutional and the last clause was not indefinite because it was limited in its effect by the preceding words to which it was an adjunct; this was merely to say, that a &quot;satisfactory explanation,&quot; required by the last clause of the statute, was one which indicated that the suspected person was not loitering.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, which reversed a judgment convicting defendants of loitering in a railroad station. The court also upheld the constitutionality of the statute which they were accused of violating.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - loitering about railway station - constitutional law - (1) person who loiters about railway station and cannot &quot;give satisfactory explanation&quot; is guilty of offense (Penal Law, &sect; 1990-a, subd. 2); statute is not void for indefiniteness; &quot;loiters&quot; is well-understood word and in this context is further restricted by requiring questioning on scene; &quot;explanation&quot; need not satisfy any policeman but must show person is not trespasser - &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (2) such construction follows from canon of construction ejusdem generis and legislative intent - (3) conviction of defendants properly reversed and information dismissed for lack of proof; possibility was not excluded that defendants remained in station for legitimate purpose. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The provision in the Penal Law ( &sect; 1990-a, subd. 2) that &quot;Any person who loiters about any toilet, station or station platform of a subway or elevated railway or of a railroad, or who is found sleeping therein or thereon and who is unable to give satisfactory explanation of his presence is guilty of an offense&quot; is constitutional.  Loitering is a well-understood term, in common usage. The inclusion of the words &quot;and who is unable to give satisfactory explanation of his presence&quot; does not render the statute void for indefiniteness. They do not broaden but restrict the offense.  They outline a procedure to be followed in ascertaining whether a person is loitering. It was not intended that the explanation must be satisfactory to an individual police officer. The explanation must show that the person has come to the premises under circumstances which do not render him a trespasser.The words do not furnish&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a basis for conviction by themselves and do not add any substantive element to the offense.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  This construction follows from the canon of construction </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ejusdem generis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and from the legislative intent which was to prevent persons with no occasion to be there, from remaining in the stated premises and to prevent the danger to the public which might otherwise develop.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  However, the conviction of the defendants was properly reversed and the information dismissed for lack of proof.  The evidence was that they were observed in a railroad station about 5:00 P.M.; that they did not take the 5:11 train but remained there until about 5:25 when the police arrived and asked defendants what they were doing; that they said they had just arrived whereas in fact they had been in the station for about three quarters of an hour, and that no railroad tickets were found on them.  The police failed to pursue their inquiry.  The possibility was not excluded that defendants entered the station and remained there for some legitimate purpose other than taking a train. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer filed a complaint under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 106, 112, and 113 against respondent city. The taxpayer sought review of the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which dismissed the taxpayer's complaint and denied a motion for an injunction pendente lite.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer disputed the trial court's order agreeing with the city that an area was substandard and insanitary. The court affirmed because there was ample evidence to justify the determination by modern tests and that the whole 6.32 acres, taken together, could reasonably be considered a single &quot;area&quot; for clearance and redevelopment purposes. Power to make that determination had been lodged by N.Y. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 1, and N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 72-k in the city planning commission and the board of estimate and their finding was not corrupt or irrational or baseless. There was nothing for the court to do about it, unless every act and decision of other departments of government was subject to revision by the court. Since no corruption or fraud was charged, the taxpayer could not succeed in such a suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed and the appeal dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal corporations - eminent domain - slum clearance and redevelopment - (1) statute (General Municipal Law, &sect; 72-k) which provides that &quot;substandard and insanitary areas&quot; may be acquired for slum clearance is constitutional; slum area need not be rehabilitated only by reconstruction for low cost housing; words &quot;substandard and insanitary areas&quot; supply sufficient legal standard - (2) record justifies determination by planning commission and board of estimate of New York City that whole of defined area might reasonably be considered single area for clearance and redevelopment purposes - (3) no question of fact presented; question is one of power and power to make determination has been conferred on defendants - (4) appeal on certified question from denial of injunction pendente lite&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dismissed (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 589, subd. 4, par. [b]; &sect; 603).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 1 of article XVIII of the State Constitution authorizes the Legislature to provide for slum clearance &quot;by such means and upon such terms and conditions as it may prescribe&quot; and provides that &quot;substandard and insanitary areas&quot; may be acquired for that purpose.  Section 72-k of the General Municipal Law, which also provides that &quot;substandard and insanitary areas&quot; may be acquired for slum clearance, is constitutional.  Slum clearance is in itself a public purpose separate and distinct from the objects to which the land may subsequently be devoted. The State Constitution does not require that slums be rehabilitated exclusively by reconstruction for low cost housing. The area may be rehabilitated according to any design and for any purpose which renders the area no longer substandard or insanitary. The words &quot;substandard and insanitary areas&quot; have been used in other statutes and supply a legal standard for the determination of what a slum is.  The statute is valid against an attack that it fails to prescribe standards or safeguards governing the clearance, replanning, reconstruction and rehabilitation of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  substandard and insanitary areas, and the means, terms and conditions of carrying the constitutional provision into effect are stated with sufficient particularity.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The New York City Planning Commission and the Board of Estimate of the City of New York determined that a substantial part of an area covering 6.32 acres in the city of New York was &quot;substandard and insanitary&quot;, and that the whole of the area might reasonably be considered a single area for clearance and redevelopment purposes.  Approximately 20% of the land is occupied by dwellings, all but one of which are more than sixty years old, 7% by hotels and rooming houses, 34% by parking lots, where once there were outmoded buildings, and 39% by nonresidential structures.  The record justifies this determination.  The courts may not interfere when the finding made by these bodies was not made corruptly or irrationally or without basis.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Judgment was properly granted dismissing, without a trial, the action of a taxpayer (General Municipal Law, &sect; 51) who demanded that a trial be held to determine the validity of the conclusion that the area was substandard and insanitary. Since no corruption or fraud was charged, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the taxpayer cannot succeed unless there be a total lack of power in defendants to proceed as they have.  The acts complained of must be fraudulent or amount to a waste of public property in the sense that they represent the use of public property or funds for entirely illegal purposes.  There is no real question of fact involved herein since the details as to the age, condition and present use of property are undisputed. The question is only one of power and the power to make this determination has been conferred by statute on these defendants.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  An appeal, taken by permission of the Appellate Division on a certified question, from an order of the Appellate Division affirming an order of Special Term denying an injunction </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">pendente lite</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, must be dismissed (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 589, subd. 4, par. [b]; &sect; 603).  </SPAN></P>

The court granted the motion to amend the remittitur the extent that a new trial was ordered. The court remitted the case for trial. The corporation that held title to the cathedral premises was entitled to possession thereof. There could be no doubt that the trustees of the corporation were charged with the duty of caring for and maintaining the property.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious corporations and associations - administration of church property - (1) United States Supreme Court reversed determination by Court of Appeals that article 5-C of Religious Corporations Law was constitutional and made judgment for plaintiff mandatory in ejectment action to recover&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  possession of cathedral of North American Diocese of Russian Orthodox Church; new trial granted since in prior decision Court of Appeals had stated that, in any event, new trial would have been required under common-law principles - (2) United States Supreme Court did not consider validity of such common-law disposition - (3) civil courts may operate in disputes involving religious bodies - (4) discretionary power to determine whether leaders of North American metropolitan district were proper trustees to carry out religious trust, has not been exercised - (5) civil court must determine whether church authority is duly constituted - (6) proper administration of trust requires determination whether Archbishop of North American metropolitan district or appointee of Moscow Patriarchate be put in possession of cathedral. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  In this ejectment action to recover possession of the cathedral, located in New York City, of the North American Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Court of Appeals (302 N.Y. 1) had decided that, under article 5-C of the Religious Corporations Law, final judgment for plaintiff, owner of record title to the cathedral premises and representing the autonomous&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  North American district, was mandatory.  The United States Supreme Court (344 U.S. 94) reversed that decision and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals &quot;for such further action as it deems proper&quot; and determined that said article 5-C, as construed, was an unconstitutional interference with the free exercise of religion. The Court of Appeals had pointed out that, were it not for the decisive effect of article 5-C, a new trial would have been required, in any event, under common-law principles.  Accordingly, the matter should be remitted to the State Supreme Court for trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The United States Supreme Court did not determine the constitutional validity of the alternative common-law disposition of the case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Civil courts can and must operate in some areas in controversies involving religious bodies ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Watson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Jones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 13 Wall. [U.S.] 679, distinguished). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  In the prior opinion, the Court of Appeals had stated that, as a matter of common law, there was room for an exercise of the discretionary power of the State Supreme Court over the conduct of trustees, in favor of the North American metropolitan district, and that the conclusion would have been warranted that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the leaders of the North American metropolitan district were the trustees who might be relied upon to carry out more effectively and faithfully the purposes of the religious trust and who would administer the temporalities of the Saint Nicholas Cathedral for the benefit of the faithful for whose use it was originally dedicated.  It was pointed out, however, that such discretionary power had not been exercised.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The highest church authority or tribunal, whose decision is to be accorded final and conclusive effect, must be capable of functioning freely, with its activities directed by churchmen in the interests of the church and in accord with the organic law of the church. Where a property right turns upon a decision of the church authority, the civil court is under a duty to ascertain whether the purported authority is duly constituted and functioning. To reject the claim of plaintiff that the central church authority had been absorbed by the Russian Government and its action deprived of religious significance, without hearing and weighing all the evidence, would be unjust and would constitute an infringement of the right to free exercise of religion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  Plaintiff corporation, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which holds title to the cathedral premises, is undoubtedly entitled to possession thereof, and the trustees of the corporation, who are now members of the North American metropolitan district, are charged with the duty of caring for and maintaining the property and must administer it in accord with and subject to the usage and for the beneficiaries for whom the trust was originally created.  The question of the proper administration of the cathedral trust requires a determination as to whether the Archbishop of the North American metropolitan district or the appointee of the Moscow Patriarchate is to be put in possession of the cathedral. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State brought an action against the national bank for alleged violations of N.Y. Banking Law &sect; 258(1). The trial court found in favor of the national bank and dismissed the complaint. The appellate court reversed, restraining the national bank from soliciting &quot;savings accounts&quot; and advertising in violation of &sect; 258. On further review, the court affirmed but modified the appellate court's order to strike portions that related to soliciting accounts as a savings bank because there had been no evidence of that violation. The court agreed that it was undisputed that the national bank had used the words &quot;saving&quot; and &quot;savings&quot; in its advertising and in the conduct of its banking operations in violation of &sect; 258. There was no contrary federal statute or issue of preemption because the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 371, did not regulate advertising to prevent deception but rather prescribed the particular kind of business that national banks could conduct. The purpose of New York's statute was to prevent the public from being misled into believing that commercial banks were mutual savings banks.</SPAN></P>

Restrictions on their advertising (U.S. Code, tit. 12, &sect;&sect; 583-586; now tit. 18, &sect; 709) contain no prohibition against use of the word &quot;saving&quot; or &quot;savings&quot;.  Nevertheless, national banks are subject in many ways to the general nondiscriminatory laws of the States in which they exist, and must abide by State regulations insofar as the latter do not collide directly with Federal laws or frustrate national banking policy or impair the position of national banks&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in discharging their duties.  The New York statute permits national banks to advertise for and accept interest deposits of the savings type, but not to mislead the public by the use of the long-established word &quot;savings&quot; into believing that a commercial bank is a mutual savings bank. The statute does not directly conflict with any overriding Federal statute.  Congress did not intend to authorize national banks to use deceptive verbiage in order to get interest deposits. The weight of evidence confirms the finding of the Appellate Division - which reversed Special Term - that the national banks in this State which have obeyed our statute have nevertheless prospered and have greatly increased the number of their interest accounts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Section 258 of our Banking Law also provides that only a savings bank or a savings and loan association shall &quot;solicit or receive deposits as a savings bank&quot;.  But there is no evidence that defendant violates or intends to violate this part of the statute; hence this part of the injunction should be stricken. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant State sought review from the judgment of the Montgomery County Supreme Court (New York), which dismissed charges against defendant for violating N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 11(1), which dismissed the information, which discharged defendant, and which remitted to him a fine of $ 10.00.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a New York resident employed by a Delaware corporation, was convicted of driving an unlicensed vehicle, a motor vehicle not registered and licensed in New York State. The vehicle consisted of two units, one a motor tractor that had been registered and licensed in Rhode Island, and the other a trailer that had been registered and licensed in North Carolina. The lower court reversed the conviction and the State appealed. On review, the court found that because the offense consisted of driving an unlicensed vehicle defendant driver could not escape prosecution by showing that another was the owner of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the matter to the lower court for a determination on the facts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - motor vehicles in interstate commerce - highways - State registration requirements - (1) truck driver, driving tractor trailer registered in other State from one city to another city in New York and containing goods transported from another State to first city, properly convicted of operating motor vehicle not registered in New York - (2) New York State does not require registration of motor vehicles owned by nonresidents whose States grant us reciprocal exemption (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 11, subd. 1; &sect; 51, subd. 1), but registration is required of vehicles&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  transporting &quot;property for hire or profit from one point in this state to another point in this state&quot; (&sect; 51, subd. 3) - (3) States may regulate and exact compensation for use of highways - (4) Federal Motor Carrier Act does not occupy entire field of legislation - (5) truck driver guilty, even though he is not owner - (6) conviction erroneously reversed on law; matter remitted to County Court for determination on facts (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 543-a).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A motor vehicle, consisting of a tractor which had been registered and licensed in Rhode Island and a trailer which had been registered and licensed in North Carolina, contained several lots of merchandise, all in their original packages, being transported in interstate commerce on a single waybill from Maryland to a city in New York State.  The goods had been carried to another city in New York State on another vehicle operated by defendant's employer and had stayed for a short period of time in the employer's warehouse in that city.  The driver of the vehicle was rightly convicted and fined for operating on the public highways of New York State a motor vehicle not registered and licensed in New York State (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &sect; 11, subd. 1).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The Vehicle and Traffic Law prohibits the operation of any motor vehicle on the public highways of the State without first being registered under New York law (&sect; 11, subd. 1), but exempts vehicles owned by nonresidents whose States grant reciprocal exemptions (&sect; 51, subd. 1).  However, it excepts from such exemption and requires the licensing of any motor vehicle &quot;which is operated on any public highway of this state to transport * * * property for hire or profit from one point in this state to another point in this state&quot; (&sect; 51, subd. 3).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The New York law imposes a burden of sorts on property moving in interstate commerce. But the States, under their police power, may, without violating the commerce clause of the United States Constitution, regulate the use of their own highways and exact compensation for that use.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The Federal Motor Carrier Act not only does not so occupy the field as to exclude State registration requirements of vehicles engaged in interstate commerce, but specifically states that it shall not &quot;affect the powers of taxation of the several States&quot; (U.S. Code, tit. 49, &sect; 302, subd. [b] ).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Defendant driver could not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  escape prosecution by showing that another was the owner of the vehicle.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  Since the judgment of conviction was erroneously reversed on the law, the case should be remitted to the County Court for determination on the facts (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 543-a).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner appealed the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), affirming the dismissal of petitioner's action, which sought an order directing respondent to reimburse petitioner's expenses incurred in defense of petitioner's antitrust violations indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was indicted for violations of antitrust laws. Upon pleading nolo contendere and upon rejection by respondent for reimbursement, petitioner applied to the district court for an order directing reimbursement of his litigation expenses. The district court dismissed petitioner's action, holding that the federal court had no power to enter such an order in a criminal cause. The lower state court dismissed petitioner's complaint and held that petitioner's antitrust suit resulted in an adjudication of liability for misconduct in the performance of his duties and that, under N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 64, he could not be awarded reimbursement. On appeal, the lower state court's decision was affirmed. Petitioner appealed. This court affirmed, holding that, under Article 6-A of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law, court-mandated reimbursement could not be had as to expenses of one defending himself against criminal charges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporations - reimbursement of litigation expenses of corporate officials - criminal prosecutions - (1) officer and director may not be reimbursed by corporation for expenses incurred in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defense of criminal prosecution for alleged violation of Sherman Anti-Trust Act, under article 6-A of General Corporation Law - (2) no evidence that provisions for reimbursement, enacted because of court decision to effect that corporation had no common-law duty of reimbursement, were intended to apply to criminal prosecutions - (3) legislation was concerned with civil causes only - (4) provision for reimbursement of expenses in &quot;any action, suit or proceeding&quot; (General Corporation Law, &sect; 64) means civil proceedings only - (5) moreover, such statutory provisions should not be construed as conferring civil jurisdiction on courts having only criminal jurisdiction, in violation of Constitution (N.Y. Const., art. VI, &sect; 11).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Petitioner sought reimbursement of expenses from a corporation in a proceeding under article 6-A (&sect;&sect; 64-68) of the General Corporation Law, alleging that he and the corporation, of which he was an officer and director, had been indicted for alleged violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, that he had pleaded </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">nolo contendere</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and had been fined $500 and that he had expended money for attorneys' fees and disbursements.  Petitioner may not be reimbursed for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such expenses.  The Legislature, in enacting article 6-A, did not intend to provide reimbursement to anyone for attorneys' fees incurred in defense of a criminal prosecution against himself.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The provisions for reimbursement in article 6-A were enacted after a court decision had been made that a corporation in whose behalf a stockholders' suit had been brought was not obligated at common law to pay legal fees incurred by its directors in defending themselves as individual defendants in such an action.  Sections 27-a and 61-a of the General Corporation Law had been passed to overcome the effect of that decision as to fees of corporate officers.  Neither of those sections had any relation to a criminal case. In 1945, section 27-a became section 63 in new article 6-A and the remaining sections (64-68) of article 6-A were added (L. 1945, ch. 869).  Section 64 contains broadened provisions for assessment against a corporation of the expenses of any person who is made a party to &quot;any action, suit or proceeding&quot; because of his being an officer, director or employee unless it shall have been adjudged that he was liable for neglect or misconduct in the performance of his duties. There&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is no evidence that the Legislature intended that these provisions should apply to defense costs in a criminal case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  There are, on the other hand, affirmative indications that the Legislature was legislating about civil causes only.  For example, the Law Revision Commission's report, with which these statutes originated, and the decisions and writings cited therein, refer only to civil proceedings. When the suggestions of the commission were enacted into law, they were included in the same chapter with the new statutes requiring security from certain plaintiffs in stockholders' suits, indicating that the Legislature considered articles 6 and 6-A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">in pari materia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and that everything in both articles referred to civil litigation.  Article 6-A follows after and is an obvious supplement to article 6, which, in its sections 60 and 61, describes certain civil actions which may be brought by or on behalf of a corporation against its officers or agents for misconduct toward the corporation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The words &quot;any action, suit or proceeding&quot; in section 64 might include criminal proceedings if they stood alone and there were no sure guides to their real significance, but that identical&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  phrase was found in the old sections 27-a and 61-a which were never claimed to apply to criminal cases.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Moreover, section 64, being in derogation of common law, is to be strictly construed.  It refers to section 65 which specifies that remuneration is to be sought in the action, suit or proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or in a separate proceeding in Supreme Court.  Such provision should not be construed as an unconstitutional grant of jurisdiction in civil matters to a court which is vested with jurisdiction only in criminal prosecutions (N.Y. Const., art. VI, &sect; 11).  Since section 65 is thus limited to a civil action or proceeding, the legislative intention was to so limit section 64 also.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The motion picture company contended that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 122, the statute under which the board of regents refused to license the particular French film, was invalid in that it imposed a prior restraint upon the exercise of freedom of speech and press. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A determination of the Motion Picture Division of the State Education Department and of the Regents of the University of the State of New York refusing to license for public exhibition a foreign, revised motion picture called &quot;La Ronde&quot;, which presented the story of a round of sexual promiscuity, on the ground that such film is &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;would tend to corrupt morals&quot; (Education Law, &sect; 122), was properly confirmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Although the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press include motion pictures, the State may reasonably exercise its police power to censor them by prior restraint, for the health and welfare of its inhabitants and the protection of the institution of marriage and the home.  Motion pictures have vast potentialities and there is no effective way to suppress the damaging ones except by censorship. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The people should not be relegated to the industry's own boards of self-review, nor, in the case of foreign films, to the discretion of customs officials.  The State has properly placed the power of censorship in the Board of Regents, which is at the head of the State's educational system, rather than in local officials who may at times have varying provincial views.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The words &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;would tend to corrupt morals&quot; (Education Law, &sect; 122) define the standard of judgment sufficiently to meet the constitutional requirements of due process of law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Section 122 of the Education Law was properly applied by the Board of Regents.  There is reasonable basis for their finding that the film is immoral and tends to corrupt morals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent fraternal society and intervenor committee members sought review of an order by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed an order dissolving the corporate existence of the fraternal society organized under N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 14 and directing petitioner Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York to take possession of its property and liquidate its business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The superintendent sought to dissolve and liquidate the fraternal society because of its involvement in financing Communist Party activities in violation of its charter. The fraternal society and committee members contended that liquidation under N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 511 applied only to the insurer's financial loss or risk of loss arising out of its business transactions and that &sect; 511 violated due process and their rights to freedom of speech, press, and assembly. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The trial court properly ordered the dissolution and liquidation of the fraternal society because the record supported the conclusion that further operation of the society would prove hazardous in a financial sense under &sect; 511. The fraternal society financed Communist Party organizers and publications and supported political candidates in violation of its charter, N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 463(3)(c), (d), and N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 671. The court rejected the contention that liquidation caused undue hardship to the society's members who could not otherwise secure insurance because the superintendent arranged for other insurers to provide similar insurance coverage to the society's members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order of the lower courts directing the superintendent to dissolve the fraternal society and to take possession of its property and liquidate its business.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent trustee, acting on behalf of creditors, filed suit to hold appellant buyer accountable, under the Bulk Sales Act, N.Y. Pers. Prop. Law &sect; 44 for the value of a batch of off-season shoes sold to the buyer by the bankrupt. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) ordered an accounting as well as ordered the buyer to pay the trustee the amount he paid for the shoes, and the buyer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue was whether the sale of the off-season merchandise constituted a sale in bulk other than in the ordinary course of trade and in the regular prosecution of the shoe business. The bankrupt had opened a shoe store and stocked the store. After only five months, the inventory declined considerably and consisted of off-season shores. To clear the shelves of those off-season shoes, as well as to obtain cash to pay debts and obtain credit for the purchase of new stock, the bankrupt sold 1,300 pairs of shoes to the buyer, who was a dealer in leftover footwear. The bankrupt conceded that he did not comply with the requirements of the Bulk Sales Act, but there was no indication that there was any intention to defraud any of the bankrupt's creditors. The bankrupt continued in business for six months, then filed a petition for bankruptcy. The court reversed the decision of the appeals court finding that the Bulk Sales Act was never designed to cover the sort of sale effected by the bankrupt and the buyer. The Bulk Sales Act was found to apply only in rare and irregular cases. The court found that the sale and purchase of off-season shoes was no rare and irregular occurrence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment that ordered an accounting and ordered the buyer to pay the trustee the amount he paid for the shoes was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales - bulk sales - creditors' suit - (1) sale in bulk of part or whole of stock of merchandise except in &quot;ordinary course of trade&quot; and in &quot;regular prosecution of said business&quot; is void as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  against seller's creditors unless buyer notifies creditors and keeps inventory of cost prices to seller, for their inspection (Personal Property Law, &sect; 44) - (2) sale in good faith by small retail shoe store of 1,300 pairs of off-season shoes to dealer, for best cash price obtainable, was valid; no intent to defraud creditors shown; seller did not discontinue any line of merchandise and continued in business as before until filing of bankruptcy petition six months later; action for accounting, by trustee in bankruptcy against buyer, dismissed - (3) large retailers of shoes have money to advertise clearance sales of their obsolete shoes or to own outlet stores, but small retailers must get cash from dealers; creditors may set aside fraudulent sales (under Debtor and Creditor Law and Bankruptcy Act).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The Bulk Sales Act (Personal Property Law, &sect; 44) provides that &quot;The sale * * * in bulk of any part or the whole of a stock of merchandise * * * pertaining to the conducting of the business of the seller * * * otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade and in the regular prosecution of said business, shall be void as against the creditors of the seller&quot; unless the buyer obtains&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from the seller a verified list of all creditors and the amounts owed them, and notifies the creditors personally or by registered mail of the terms of the proposed sale, and obtains from the seller and keeps for the creditors' inspection an inventory showing the cost price to the seller of each article sold.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  In this case, the seller had opened a family shoe store in the winter and stocked it at a cost of some $25,000.  By May, his inventory had declined to around $19,000 and still consisted, in part, of fall and winter styles.  To clear his shelves of the off-season shoes, as well as to obtain cash to pay debts and thus obtain credit for the purchase of new summer stock, he sold some thirteen hundred pairs of shoes for $3,549.50 to defendant, a dealer in leftover footwear.  There is no suggestion that the seller did not get the best price available, and the Official Referee found that there was no intent to defraud creditors.  The seller did not discontinue any branch or line or brand of his merchandise. He continued in business for six months after the sale, until the filing of a petition in bankruptcy.  In this action by the trustee in bankruptcy against the buyer for an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  accounting, a dismissal of the complaint should be affirmed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The record shows that shoe styles vary sharply from season to season, with the result that last year's &quot;rage&quot; may clog this season's shelves.  A merchant seeks to clear his store as rapidly as possible of unsold shoes. Larger stores may widely advertise &quot;clearance sales&quot; or operate their own &quot;special outlet&quot; stores.  But the smaller retailer lacks such means and must rely on dealers who specialize in unseasonable obsolete shoes. Such inevitably recurring sales are vital to the operation of the smaller independent retailer and must be regarded, in the words of section 44, as sales made &quot;in the ordinary course of trade and in the regular prosecution of said business&quot;.  If fraud or covert advantage is later unearthed, a creditor may set the sale aside (under Debtor and Creditor Law, &sect; 276; or under Bankruptcy Act; U.S. Code, tit. 11, &sect; 21, subd. [a], pars. [1], [2]; &sect; 96, subd. [b]; &sect; 107).  If the retailer had first to find a dealer who was willing to subject himself to the requirements of section 44, the price would almost certainly be lower; or if the retailer instead held a below-cost clearance sale, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he would find it difficult later to sell shoes to his customers at regular prices, and thus, contrary to the purpose of section 44, the retailer's creditors would find themselves in a hazardous lot.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employees challenged the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the first judicial department (New York) which affirmed the grant of a motion by defendant employer for judgment dismissing the employees' complaints for injuries sustained on the job.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employees contracted partially disabling silicosis as a result of the employer's negligence and violation of state labor laws. The workmen's compensation statute only provided recovery for total disability due to silicosis. The trial court dismissed the claim, and the appellate court affirmed. The court affirmed the dismissal and held that the workmen's compensation scheme was the exclusive remedy for the employees, even though it provided no compensation at all. The provisions of the workmen's compensation law was a complete bar to the maintenance of any of the causes of action in these two complaints.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment that affirmed the order dismissing the employees' claim against the employer for work related injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - silicosis - workmen's compensation as exclusive remedy - partial disability - (1) for silicosis and other dust diseases, Workmen's Compensation Law provides benefits for total disability or death, but not for partial disability; scheme of Workmen's Compensation Law is exclusive; dismissal of common-law actions for such partial disabilities affirmed; due process of law not thereby denied - (2) even though plaintiffs allege that diseases were incurred&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  because employer failed to provide pure air devices in violation of sections 200 and 299 of Labor Law, Workmen's Compensation Law is their sole recourse.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The benefits provided in the Workmen's Compensation Law, for injuries and diseases in employments covered by the law, are &quot;exclusive and in place of any other liability whatsoever * * * at common law or otherwise&quot; (&sect; 11).  For silicosis and other dust diseases, the law provides compensation for total disability or death, but expressly states that &quot;compensation shall not be payable for partial disability due to silicosis or other dust disease&quot; (&sect; 39; L. 1936, ch. 887).Such limitation of benefits is constitutional and does not deny due process of law.  (N.Y. Const., art. I, &sect;&sect; 6, 18; U.S. Const., 14th Amendt.) Dismissal of these common-law actions for such partial disabilities should be affirmed.  If this result is harsh, it is for the Legislature, not the courts, to improve the statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  It is alleged in these common-law actions that plaintiffs incurred silicosis because of defendant employer's violations of the Labor Law ( &sect; 200, entitled &quot;General duty to protect health and safety of employees&quot;, and &sect; 299, entitled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Ventilation, heating and humidity&quot;).  Nevertheless, for the reasons above set forth, the employees' only remedy is the Workmen's Compensation Law. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant legatee sought review of an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed an order of the surrogate court that settled respondent executor's account to have been deposited with the New York City treasurer, pursuant to N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act &sect; 269.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The surrogate court directed that the deceased's bequest of her estate to the legatee, who was a national of Hungary, was to have been deposited with the New York City treasurer for the legatee's account, pursuant to N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act &sect; 269. The appellate court affirmed despite the legatee's contention that &sect; 269 was unconstitutional and that the bequest should have been placed in a domestic bank account handled by the Hungarian Consulate General. The court affirmed on appeal. The court held that &sect; 269 was not preempted by federal law because its purpose was to insure the intended distribution of estates administered by courts and assure the bequest was transmitted to its proper designate, an area that was outside the scope of federal law. Absent any conflict with national policy, the court held that states were able to exercise power over the administration of estates and &sect; 269 was a valid embodiment of such power. The court also held that &sect; 269 was not in contravention to Hungary's treaty with the United States because that treaty did not sanction transfer of a bequest to the Hungarian Consulate General.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order of the appellate court that affirmed the surrogate court's order, which directed that the balance due to the legatee was to have been deposited with the New York City treasurer pursuant to the New York Surrogate's Court Procedure Act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional law - appeal - United States statutes - treaties - wills - payment to legatee residing in communist country - (1) Federal Trading with the Enemy Act (U.S. Code, tit. 50, Appendix, &sect; 5, subd. [b] ) and executive orders issued thereunder do not pre-empt area covered by State statute (Surrogate's Ct. Act, &sect; 269); purpose of Federal regulation entirely unrelated to goal of State enactment; thus no conflict in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  application of Federal and State provisions - (2) application by Surrogate of State statute not in contravention of treaty between United States and Hungary; treaty provision allowing consular officers to receive distributive shares from estates on behalf of nonresident countrymen requires that officers shall be able to remit funds to distributees; United States law bars export of such funds to Hungary - (3) State statute does not encroach on national power to regulate foreign commerce (U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8, subd. 3); statute adopted pursuant to State's power to regulate transmission of property by will and establish procedure governing wills and administration; State's procedure should be honored in absence of overriding Federal policy - (4) statute properly applied and necessary although funds have been frozen by Federal regulations; possible lifting of freezing order without assurance that legatee will receive funds as required by statute; Surrogate properly relied on Treasury Department's conclusion that conditions in Hungary precluded such assurance that legatee would receive bequest - (5) Surrogate's refusal to grant hearing not violative of due process; statute did not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  deprive legatee of property or right to its possession - (6) direction that bequest to resident of Hungary be deposited with city treasurer instead of in Hungarian Consulate's &quot;blocked account&quot; in domestic bank, properly made by Surrogate; statute, pursuant to which Surrogate acted, held valid - (7) constitutional issues necessarily decided; appeal properly taken as of right (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 588, subd. 1).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Subdivision (b) of section 5 of the Federal Trading with the Enemy Act (U.S. Code, tit. 50, Appendix, &sect; 5, subd. [b] ) which empowers the President to regulate or prohibit any &quot;acquisition, holding, withholding, use, transfer * * * importation of or exportation of * * * any property in which any foreign country or any national thereof has an interest&quot; and Executive Order No. 8389, issued pursuant thereto by the President, prohibiting transactions involving property in which Hungary or any national thereof has at any time on or since March 12, 1941, had any interest, serve a purpose entirely unrelated to the goal of section 269 of the Surrogate's Court Act.  The Federal enactment seeks to check trading with the enemy and to stop such uses of foreign property rights as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  might imperil national defense, whereas section 269 aims to promote the basic obligation of courts of decedent devolution to effectuate a decedent's wishes respecting disposal of his assets on death by its application where the payment of a bequest to a person resident in a foreign country might be circumvented by partial or total confiscation.  Inasmuch as section 269 treats a matter beyond and outside the scope of the Federal law, the area covered by it could not have been pre-empted by the national enactment.  There is thus no conflict in the application of the two provisions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The Surrogate's application of section 269 does not contravene provisions of the treaty between the United States and Hungary.  Nothing in the treaty compels or sanctions transfer of the bequest to the Hungarian Consular officer.  The proviso in article XXI of the treaty which allows a consular officer on behalf of his nonresident countrymen to &quot;receipt for their distributive shares derived from estates in process of probate&quot; requires that the officer must be in a position to &quot;remit any funds so received * * * to the proper distributees&quot;.  That cannot be done in this case inasmuch as the law of this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  country expressly bars export of the funds to Hungary.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  The New York statute does not encroach on the national power &quot;to regulate Commerce with foreign nations&quot; (U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8, subd. 3).  The State adopted section 269 pursuant to its power to regulate the manner upon which property within its dominion may be transmitted by will and, incident to such power, to establish the procedure governing probate of wills and processes of administration.  In the absence of any overriding Federal policy the State procedure should be honored in accordance with Federal authority which has upheld the right of a State to impose special taxes on legacies left to aliens, to limit the right of foreign consuls to administer estates of their nationals, to grant aliens an unqualified right to inherit property within its borders or to make that right dependent on the existence of a reciprocal right of United States citizens in the alien's country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The Surrogate properly applied the provisions of section 269.  The fact that the bequest consisted of &quot;blocked funds&quot; does not mean that the statute is not needed.  Inasmuch as the blocking regulations are dependent upon national defense considerations, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the freezing order might be lifted without assurance that the legatee would receive the funds as required by section 269.  The Surrogate properly relied on the conclusion of the United States Treasury Department that &quot;local conditions in Hungary * * * are such that there is not a reasonable assurance that a payee in those areas will actually receive&quot; payment or be able to negotiate them for full value (Code of Fed. Reg., tit. 31, &sect; 211.3, subd. a).  This conclusion was directly relevant to the Surrogate's determination and supplied sufficient basis for his application of section 269.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  The Surrogate's refusal to grant a hearing did not violate the demands of due process and the legatee has not been deprived of her property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner physicians challenged determinations of respondent Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York, which disciplined each of them pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6514(2)(b) after they were convicted in a federal court of contempt of Congress pursuant to 2 U.S.C.S. &sect; 192. The physicians' proceedings for review under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A federal court convicted three physicians of contempt of Congress in violation of 2 U.S.C.S. &sect; 192 in that each of them failed to obey a subpoena requiring them to produce before a Congressional committee documents pertaining to their membership in a voluntary association. The board suspended the medical licenses of two of the physicians and censured and reprimanded the third. In consolidated proceedings under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, the physicians sought review. The court affirmed. Disciplinary action under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6514(2)(b) was not limited to those convicted of a crime specifically forbidden by a state penal statute because the statute's clear language referred to conviction either within or without the state. The word &quot;crime&quot; in New York law included misdemeanors as well as felonies. If the legislature had intended to limit the reach of &sect; 6514(2)(b) to offenses involving moral turpitude, it would have stated that limitation explicitly. The court was without jurisdiction to evaluate whether the board's actions were too severe or whether it gave improper weight to certain matters in determining punishment because the board committed no errors of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the determinations made by the board in taking disciplinary action against three physicians who were convicted in federal court of contempt of Congress.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Physicians and surgeons - disciplinary proceedings - (1) Board of Regents had power to suspend, for several months, licenses of doctors who were convicted by Federal court of misdemeanor of contempt of Congress in disobeying subpoena of Congressional committee; they were &quot;convicted in a court of competent jurisdiction, either within or without this state, of a crime&quot; (Education Law, &sect; 6514, subd. 2, par. [b] ) - (2) &quot;crime&quot; includes misdemeanor (Penal Law, &sect; 2) - (3) Education Law ( &sect; 6514, subd. 2, par. [b] ) not limited to crimes under New York law - (4) Board of Regents may use own good sense if confronted with act which is not criminal in New York - (5) statute is not limited to moral turpitude&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or professional misconduct - (6) statute needs no cutting down for constitutionality's sake - (7) Regents took voluminous testimony and must have considered moral right and wrong - (8) Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction to review administrative discretion as to denial of assertedly weighty considerations.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The Education Law ( &sect; 6514, subd. 2, par. [b] ) authorizes the Board of Regents to discipline a physician who &quot;has been convicted in a court of competent jurisdiction, either within or without this state, of a crime&quot;.  Under this statute, the board was authorized, after a hearing, to suspend for several months the license of two physicians and to censure a third physician, each of whom had been convicted by a Federal court of the misdemeanor of contempt of Congress in disobeying a subpoena of a Congressional committee (U.S. Code, tit. 2, &sect; 192) to produce the records of an anti-fascist refugee committee of which he was an executive, and each of whom had paid a fine and served a sentence of imprisonment therefor.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The word &quot;crime&quot; includes misdemeanors as well as felonies (Penal Law, &sect; 2).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 6514 (subd. 2, par. [b] ) of the Education Law clearly does&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not limit itself to crimes forbidden by New York law.  Therefore, in construing it, it is unnecessary to rely on the public policy implied in section 1330 of the Penal Law, which makes it a misdemeanor willfully to refuse to produce proper and material documents before a committee of the State Legislature. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Some reliance must be placed on the good sense and judgment of the Board of Regents, if, as and when they are confronted with a crime in some other State which is regarded in New York as noncriminal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Section 6514 (subd. 2, par. [b] ) of the Education Law is not limited to crimes involving moral turpitude or to crimes directly related to professional ability or misconduct.  The Legislature knows how to state such limitations when it so desires (e.g., Education Law, &sect; 7406, subd. 1; and compare Public Health Law, former &sect; 161, with present Education Law, &sect; 6502).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  Section 6514 (subd. 2, par. [b] ) needs no cutting down for constitutionality's sake.  The State can attach exacting conditions to a professional license. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  The Regents took voluminous testimony as to the character of the physicians and their purposes in disobeying the Federal subpoenas. In&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fixing the penalties, the Regents are presumed to have taken into account the moral right or wrong of the physicians.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.  The Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction to review the questions whether the Regents, in deciding on punishment, were too severe, ignored weighty considerations, and acted on matters not proper for the Regents' consideration.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, owners and lessees of land, challenged a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the second judicial department (New York), which affirmed the trial court's finding in favor of respondent city in the city's action to restrain and enjoin appellants from using a residential lot in violation of a city zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants operated a garage in a business district of the city. Immediately behind the garage was a vacant lot that was in a residential zone. Appellants later built a second story on the garage that included large doors for trucks to use as an entrance. The trucks then began entering the garage through the vacant lot. The city filed an action to restrain and enjoin appellants from using the vacant residential lot, claiming that such use was in violation of a city zoning ordinance. The trial court found in favor of the city, and the appellant court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 20(25) authorized the city to prohibit the location of a garage or any part of one on vacant residential land. Also, appellants use of their land in a residential district as a means of ingress to and egress from business property was the conduct of a &quot;trade&quot; or &quot;industry&quot; pursuant to &sect; 20(25). Further, the city ordinance did not confiscate appellants' property or otherwise offend against constitutional guarantees because the second floor was constructed eight years after the enactment of the zoning ordinance that placed the vacant lot in a residential zone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the city in its action to restrain and enjoin appellants from using a residential lot in violation of a city ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal corporations - zoning - injunction - (1) judgment properly restrained owners and lessees of garage from using rear adjoining residentially zoned lot, which they also own and lease, for access to and from residential street for garaging vehicles, for parking, and for underground gasoline tanks - (2) two-story&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  addition built on garage lot in 1928; street on which rear residential lot fronts situated higher than garage lot, so vehicles might cross residential lot and enter second floor of addition through rear doors; municipality not estopped from enforcing zoning ordinance by previously granted building permit - (3) municipality not estopped by laches; builder knew or should have known of residential zone - (4) such vehicular access began after enactment of zoning ordinance, hence it is not pre-existing nonconforming use - (5) no confiscation of property - (6) no showing that second floor could not be profitably used by building of ramp from business street. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  A city is entitled to an injunction restraining the owners and lessees of a garage in a business zone from using the rear adjoining lot - which they also own and lease and which faces a parallel street, but which is in a residence zone - as (a) a regular means of ingress and egress for the business of garaging vehicles, (b) for the parking of vehicles, and (c) for the installation of underground gasoline tanks. Such application of the zoning ordinance comes within the city's power &quot;To regulate and restrict the location of trades&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and industries&quot; ( General City Law, &sect; 20, subd. 25).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  The street on which the residential lot fronts is higher than the garage lot.  In 1928 a two-story addition was built on the garage lot.  Vehicles coming from the residential street and crossing the residential lot could enter the new structure at its second floor rear, where two doors were built for that purpose.  The municipality is not estopped from enforcing its zoning ordinance by the issuance in 1928 of a permit for said building addition with rear doors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Nor is the municipality estopped by laches.  Moreover, the owners knew or should have known in 1928 that they were planning to use a lot which had been residentially zoned since the original zoning ordinance of 1920.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The present zoning ordinance was enacted in 1928.  The Appellate Division has affirmed an Official Referee's finding that the residential lot was first used for such ingress and egress in 1929, and that therefore such use cannot be adjudged to be a pre-existing nonconforming use. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Thus, there is no confiscation of property or other violation of constitutional guarantees in restraining the owners from using the residentially zoned lot&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for daily moving of vehicles to and from the shelter of the garage building.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.  Furthermore there is no proof of confiscation in fact.  Completely absent is any showing that the second floor's present use could not be continued by building a passageway or ramp within or alongside the building so as to permit access to the second floor from the business street or, if such construction were impossible, that such floor could not be converted to some other profitable use.  </SPAN></P>
