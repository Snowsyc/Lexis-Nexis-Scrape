</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pleaded guilty to possession of methamphetamine weighing less than nine grams, a class four felony. The trial judge concluded that because he was a first-time offender, he was to be sentenced under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-901.01. The judge also determined he could incarcerate petitioner in the county jail as a condition of probation. Petitioner objected, arguing that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-901.01 prohibited the judge from imposing such a condition. The Supreme Court granted review to determine whether Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-901.01 prohibited a trial court from imposing jail time as a condition of probation for a person convicted of first-offense personal possession or use of a controlled substance. It stated that incarceration may not be imposed under such circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Arizona's Attorney General concluded that salary provision was valid but that the per diem recommendation exceeded the authority of Arizona's Commission on Salaries for Elective State Officers (Commission). Petitioners filed writ of mandamus, claiming that the Arizona legislature was obligated to enforce the per diem provision of the proposition. The court held that because the Commission's authority was limited to recommending changes in legislative salaries, and because per diem reimbursement was not a salary, the Commission lacked authority to recommend changes in the legislative per diem rate. The court held that the salary increase provision of the proposition could operate independently of the per diem provision. The court declared the per diem provision invalid, severed the per diem provision, and upheld the salary provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In Maricopa County Superior Court (Ariz.), petitioners brought separate actions for wrongful discharge against defendant employers, who argued that the Employment Protection Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1501(3)(b)(i) (supp. 1998), barred the claims. The trial courts agreed with defendants, but the Supreme Court of Arizona granted a petition for special action and motion to consolidate petitioners' claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed separate actions for wrongful discharge against defendant employers, which argued that the exclusive remedies provision of Employment Protection Act (EPA), Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1501(3)(b)(i) (supp. 1998), barred such claims. The trial judges entered judgments for defendants, but the Supreme Court of Arizona granted a petition for special action and motion to consolidate petitioners' claims. The issue presented was whether claims alleging the tort of wrongful termination in violation of public policy in the Arizona Civil Rights Act (ACRA), Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 41-1401 to -1492 (1999), could be constitutionally restricted to the ACRA's statutory remedies by EPA. The court affirmed, holding that the preamble to the EPA, though unconstitutional on its face, did not implicate the constitutionality of the statutory text; the EPA's exclusive remedies provision restricting tort claims under the ACRA violated neither the anti-abrogation clause nor non-limitation clauses of the Arizona constitution; petitioners lacked standing to assert a claim that EPA violated the equal privileges clause and failed to demonstrate the applicability of impairment of the contracts clause.</SPAN></P>

The instant action addressed two of six issues previously outlined by the court. The court concluded that if the United States implicitly intended, when it established reservations, to reserve sufficient unappropriated water to meet the reservations' needs, it must have intended that reservation of water to come from whatever particular sources each reservation had at hand. Thus, federal reserved rights applied to groundwater. The court further held that it could not defer to state law, the &quot;reasonable use&quot; doctrine, where to do so would defeat federal water rights. Thus, the court held that holders of federal reserved rights enjoy greater protection from groundwater pumping than do holders of state law rights to the extent necessary to accomplish purpose of reservation.</SPAN></P>

He also contended that the death penalty was per se cruel and unusual punishment. The court asserted that a trial court was not required to instruct on a lesser offense that was unsupported by evidence.

The court held that a recommendation of leniency from authorities that were intimately involved in a case carried significant weight and may constitute a mitigating circumstance.

Petitioner state sought review and alleged that the amendments were constitutional because they were enacted pursuant to the Victim's Bill of Rights (VBR), Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 2.1, which permitted the legislature to enact rules to assure victims' rights to speedy trials. The court affirmed and held that the amendments violated the separation of powers doctrine. Courts had the exclusive power to make procedural rules. There was no evidence that the amendments were enacted pursuant to the VBR. The legislative history revealed that the amendments were enacted to comply with a federal statute. The amendments did not apply equally to non-capital cases. Petitioner's procedural rulemaking power extended only to procedural rules concerning victims. The VBR did not create a speedy trial right that was unique to victims. The court was able to sever the unconstitutional provisions from the statute.</SPAN></P>

He sought review and alleged that the murder sentencing statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev.

The appellate court affirmed but used a balancing test to find that appellant did not have a due process right to sentencing guidelines for the murder charge. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed in part and vacated in part. The court held that the sentencing statute was not vague, that it did not violate appellant's constitutional rights, and that autopsy photographs were properly admitted because their probative value outweighed the risk of prejudice. However, the appellate court improperly used the balancing test. The statute was not vague because it clearly stated the possible penalties for first-degree murder. The due process balancing test applied to administrative proceedings, not criminal proceedings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment that affirmed dismissal of plaintiff consumers' class action alleging that defendant lenders violated the Consumer Loan Act (CLA) by selling unwanted and unnecessary insurance, making unexplained and unauthorized charges, and establishing payment plans with prohibited balloon payments on the grounds that the version of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 6-602(A), in effect between 1980 and 1984, excepted licensed lenders from the CLA's restrictions. Finding that the language of the statute was ambiguous, the court was required to determine the legislative intent by interpreting the statute as a whole taking into account the statute's context, subject matter, historical background, effects and consequences, and spirit and purpose. The court concluded that the legislative purposes and goals mandated a requirement that licensed consumer lenders submit to the CLA's non-interest restrictions, even though they were allowed to charge any interest agreed to in writing. Any decision otherwise would have nullified the CLA during those years and rendered the legislature's actions futile.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and sentences after finding that the judge was not required to recuse himself, that the juror in question did not demonstrate preconceived notions regarding defendant's guilt, and that the mitigating circumstances were not sufficiently substantial to warrant leniency in light of the aggravating factors present in the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of first-degree murder, armed robbery, and first-degree burglary. The trial court sentenced him to death for the murder convictions. After he was picked up by police for questioning, defendant made incriminating statements. Defendant later agreed to talk after his Miranda warnings were given. When a detective told defendant that they had found the bloody weapons and clothes, defendant invoked his right to a lawyer and the interrogation stopped. The court noted that because confessions were presumed involuntary, the state must show by a preponderance of the evidence that a confession was voluntary. The court will look at the totality of the circumstances to determine whether police conduct constituted overreaching. His speech was clear. He was not unkempt. He was not hysterical, hallucinating, or disoriented. On the contrary, he was friendly and cooperative. Defendant appeared to understand his discussions with police, was aware of his rights, and could communicate. No evidence existed that police conduct coerced him to speak. Therefore the judgment was affirmed on appeal because defendant's confession was voluntary.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners, various individuals, had challenged the constitutionality of the provision, which allowed a state tax credit of up to 500 dollars for those who donated to school tuition organizations. The court found that petitioners failed to demonstrate that the provision violated either the United States Constitution or the Arizona Constitution. The court found that the tuition tax credit did not prefer one religion over another, or religion over non-religion. It aided a broad spectrum of citizens, allowed a wide range of private choices, and did not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion. The court also found no excessive government entanglement with religion as the state did not involve itself in the distribution of funds or in monitoring their application. Any perceived state connection to private religious schools was indirect and attenuated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A complex litigation evolved around Arizona's surface water law where petitioners Indian tribes and United States challenged the constitutionality of legislative measures that revised the law. Respondents, the state land department, mining entities, and a river project, sought to uphold the legislation. Petitioners asserted that a strict scrutiny standard applied and that the statute impermissibly affected vested substantive rights. Respondents argued there was a presumption that all statutes were constitutional. On review, the court held that the statute impermissibly affected vested substantive rights and that a number of the statutory changes violated the separation of powers clause, Ariz. Const. art. III, because the statute purported to change both substantive and evidentiary law in midstream of a pending case. The court found that the Legislature attempted to control both the legislative and judiciary process and deprived the court of its constitutional authority to find facts and to define and apply the law. The court did uphold certain procedural aspects of the legislation, however, the statute was found unconstitutional where it violated principles of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The jury panel was not tainted by comments of two excused potential jurors. They did not have special knowledge and their comments did not constitute impermissible vouching, as they were neither prosecutors nor witnesses, and defendant's right to cross-examine was not curtailed. The court's excusing teachers from the jury pool was not error, as U.S. Const. amend. VI did not guarantee a specific makeup of a fair and impartial jury. The admission of in life, crime scene, and autopsy photographs was within the discretion of the trial court, and any error would have been harmless, as they did not beyond a reasonable doubt effect the outcome. The court conducted an independent review of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and found that the heinous, cruel, or depraved aggravator was established by the presence of relishing, mutilation, and gratuitous violence. Defendant did not meet his burden with regard to the mitigating factors as he failed to establish a causal link with the crimes.</SPAN></P>

The trial court indicated that because the concerned citizens' claims raised questions of public importance, the trial court could waive the strict standing requirements. The court reversed the order of the trial court and held that as a matter of discretion, the court could waive the requirement of standing; however, it would do so only in exceptional circumstances, generally in cases involving issues of great public importance that were likely to recur. The concerned citizens' action did not present issues of such great public importance that would have influenced the court to waive standing. The case did not raise fundamental questions of statutory construction or of the constitutionality of a statute or government action. Therefore, standing could not have been waived.</SPAN></P>

The court found that through the legislation, the state created the required minimum adequacy standards for capital facilities and ensured, through state funding, that all districts complied with these standards. However, the court determined that the legislation failed to fulfill the requirement that the state fund public schools through a financing system that did not cause substantial disparities between the districts. The funding mechanism of the legislation caused substantial disparities between opt-out and participating districts, thereby formalizing and perpetuating a structure that failed the general and uniform test. The court refused to sever the unconstitutional portion of the legislation and give effect to the statute's constitutional portions in deference to legislative authority and intent; thus, it invalidated the entire legislation.</SPAN></P>

The questions concerned whether the after-acquired evidence defense applied to a case of wrongful discharge or a case of breach of employment contract, and if it applied, how the defense limited or precluded recovery of damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee brought an age discrimination action after defendant former employer failed to promote him and laid him off. After discovery began, defendant learned that plaintiff had searched his supervisor's office and copied documents useful to his claim. The district court granted summary judgment for defendant on the after-acquired evidence defense. After the appellate court reversed the dismissal, the district court certified questions to the court. The court held that after-acquired evidence of employee misconduct was no defense to a tortious wrongful termination action, but it was relevant to remedies. If an employer demonstrated that it would have fired an employee had it known of prior misconduct, reinstatement and front pay would not be available but lost earnings would be available. However, after-acquired evidence did not bar other compensatory damages due to the employer's wrongful conduct. The court also held that after-acquired evidence of employee misconduct was a defense to a breach of contract action for wages and benefits lost as a result of discharge if the employer demonstrated that it would have fired the employee had it known of the misconduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sponsors initiated a petition drive to amend Arizona's constitution to designate English as the state's official language and to require state and local governments to conduct business in English only. After the initiative was successful, the state employees and officials brought an action challenging the constitutionality of Ariz. Const. art. XXVIII. The trial court declared the article constitutional, but the lower court reversed that decision. The court reversed the trial court's decision and vacated the lower court's opinion. The court rejected the attorney general's narrow construction of the article because the attorney general's opinion did not comport with the article's plain meaning or with the drafter's intent. Further, the article violated the First Amendment by depriving public officials and employees of the ability to communicate with the public. The court held that the article violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it unduly burdened the core right of non-English speaking individuals to petition the government for redress. The goal to promote English as a common language did not require a total prohibition on non-English usage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found two aggravating factors: (1) that there was an expectation of pecuniary gain, and (2) that the killing was especially heinous, cruel, or depraved.

It held that defendant presented substantial mitigation evidence. Defendant established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was affected by an impaired ability to conform his conduct to the law's requirements. The trial court's denial of defendant's motion for change of venue was within its discretion. The trial court did not err when it denied defendant's request to excuse venirepersons.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature amended the school financing system to include the Assistance to Build Classrooms (ABC) fund, which attempted to remedy disparity among the districts by providing need-based income to poor districts to be used as expenditures, saved, or as the basis for issuing bonds. The court found that the ABC legislation did not address the core problem of heavy reliance upon property taxation, and that it imposed different tax burdens on citizens in different districts to support the state's obligation to provide for the education of its students pursuant to Ariz. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1. The court noted that the voters could allow a district to opt out of the system by not issuing bonds, and that the amount granted was not related to actual need of the districts. The legislation gave districts the power to choose substandard facilities, which was not what the court had mandated. The court held that the legislation did not meet the constitutional requirements for funding education.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the trial court found two statutory aggravators, A.R.S. &sect; 13-703(F)(2) (prior violent felony) and (F)(6) (especially cruel, heinous, or depraved murder). The trial court resentenced defendant to death, and this automatic appeal followed. Concerned that the (F)(2) factor might be overturned on appeal, the State filed a &quot;Request to Take Judicial Notice,&quot; and asserted that in order for this court to intelligently resolve the dispute, it must have proof before it of the materials demonstrating the precise nature of the prior convictions. The court held that there was nothing in the record to indicate that the sentencing judge overstepped boundaries. The court found that having reweighed the evidence, mitigation was not sufficiently substantial to call for leniency.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in not granting his motion to dismiss for violation of his right to a speedy trial. The court held that defendant repeatedly and knowingly waived his Ariz.

The court held that defendant did not file a motion to dismiss for violation of his speedy trial rights until after the evidentiary hearings were terminated and after trial had been set. The court found that although the period between defendant's arraignment and trial was unprecedented, defendant waived his right to object by not objecting when the violation was occurring. The court held that admission of photographs of the victim was harmless because based on the overwhelming evidence against defendant, the jury would have found him guilty without the photographs.

The convictions for the two murders could be considered during his sentencing hearing regardless of the order in which the underlying crimes were committed. The sentencing court was required to consider the prior conviction because it involved the use of violence on another person. Also, the fact that the murder was both senseless and gratuitous supported a finding of aggravating circumstances. Though the defendant proved age, lack of significant prior criminal history, and deprived childhood, those mitigating circumstances did not achieve the qualitative level requisite for leniency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the decision of the Court of Appeals (Arizona), affirming his conviction for sexual abuse under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1404(A). He asserted that the trial court erred in ruling that the state did not have to prove lack of consent in a prosecution for sexual abuse where the victim was 16 years of age.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual abuse of a 16 year old pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1404(A) and was sentenced. The appellate court affirmed and he sought review, asserting that the trial court erred in denying his request for directed verdict of acquittal and in ruling that the state did not have to prove lack of consent. The court reversed. Concerned about the constitutional ramifications of reading the affirmative defense statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1407, into the definitional statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1404, it applied &sect; 13-1404 as written. It held that &sect; 13-1404 was clear and that persons of ordinary intelligence reading it would conclude that, if the victim was 14 or over, the state must prove lack of consent. Reading both &sect; 13-1404 (sexual abuse) and &sect; 13-1401 (definition of consent), it ruled that one would clearly be led to believe that a person between the ages of 14 and 17 could consent for purposes of &sect; 13-1404. The state acknowledged that the undisputed evidence showed that the victim/participant consented to the touching of her breasts. Therefore, the court held that the trial court should have granted judgments of acquittal on relevant counts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the decision of the court of appeals to the extent that it held that the state did not have to prove lack of consent.

The conviction on other related counts was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-401 (1994) created CDC to advance Arizona's sovereignty over state issues.

Section 41-401 was amended in 1996 to remove the veto power of the attorney general and his power over the funds. The court held that Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted in separate trials on unrelated offenses. As to one defendant, the Court of Appeals (Arizona) held that a defendant was always permitted to bring out at trial a victim's refusal of a pretrial interview with the defendant, and as to the other defendant, held that a defendant never permitted to bring out at trial a victim's refusal of a pretrial interview with the defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court consolidated cases on review, the state contended that the Victim's Bill of Rights implicitly provided victims a constitutional right not to be cross-examined on their refusal to grant a pretrial interview. The court determined that the right to refuse a pretrial interview was not analogous to a defendant's right to remain silent because the rights derived from two different purposes. The court held that asking the victim at trial about his or her refusal to grant a pretrial interview did not result in any greater breach of the victim's privacy, or greater contact with the defendant, than is already necessary. Defendants contended that the trial courts' decisions to restrict the cross-examination of the victims violated their federal and state constitutional rights to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against them. The court held that because defendants failed to make a showing that the victims refused the interviews for a reason bearing on their credibility, the trial court's limitations on defendant's cross-examination did not violate defendant's constitutional rights to confront adverse witnesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent trial judge and real party in interest state appealed from a decision of the Court of Appeals, Division One (Arizona), which found in favor of petitioner defendant and ruled that the trial judge should have suppressed evidence seized by the police after a fire in a rented storage unit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Firefighters responded to a fire at a storage unit rented by defendant. While extinguishing the fire, one firefighter called the police after he saw plants that appeared to be marijuana. The police arrived during the clean-up operation, observed the plants, and then seized the plants, growing equipment, and several garbage bags filled with marijuana. After being arrested and criminally charged, defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence. The trial judge denied the motion, but the appellate court vacated the trial judge's order. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that the seizure did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV or Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 8. Specifically, the court held that the firefighters' warrantless entry into the storage unit had been proper under the exigent circumstances. Moreover, the court ruled that because the police officers responded to the firefighter's call and entered the storage unit while the firefighters were still on the scene and because the police officers confined themselves to the area in which the firefighters were working and made no additional inspection, the seizure of contraband in plain view was permissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's ruling and affirmed the trial judge's denial of defendant's motion to suppress.

The court vacated the opinion of the court of appeals, reversed the superior court's judgment, and remanded for a new trial. The court did not reach the question of constitutionality and held instead that the procurement rules were inconsistent with the State Procurement Code because there was no difference between first- and second-tier administrative review and the rules did not provide a mechanism for judicial review.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the evidence was sufficient to find the murder was cruel because a victim was alive and conscious for an appreciable period of time. Murdering a person to facilitate a robbery and escape constituted murdering for pecuniary gain. No double punishment problem existed because cruelty and multiple homicide were not elements of first degree murder.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of child abuse and first degree murder, and was convicted. The Court of Appeals, Division Two (Arizona), held that expert psychological testimony that as a battered woman, defendant was unable to form the requisite mental state necessary for the commission of the charged offenses was admissible. Defendant and the state challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the expert psychological testimony was necessary to demonstrate that defendant was not capable of forming the requisite mental state of knowledge or intent, and precluding a defendant from introducing psychological testimony to challenge the mens rea element of a crime violated due process. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred when it admitted certain Ariz. R. Evid. 404(b), evidence. The court found that the Arizona legislature had not provided for a diminished capacity defense, but instead had provided the M'Naghten test as the sole standard for criminal responsibility. Consequently, Arizona did not allow evidence of a defendant's mental disorder short of insanity either as an affirmative defense or to negate the mens rea element of a crime. The court also found that evidence that defendant struck her child and had stated that she wished the child was dead was admissible under Ariz. R. Evid. 404(b), because the probative value of these acts was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the order was not testimonial and did not compel him to incriminate himself, therefore there was no self-incrimination issue. Defendant argued that the court erred in not finding mental illness and his character to be mitigating factors. The court found that defendant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was unable to either appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 17-years old when he committed the offenses for which he was later convicted. The defendant argued that he was misidentified as the offender. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and the sentences. The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to exclude portions of defendant's witness' testimony regarding identity because the statements were not sufficiently against the declarant's penal interest such that a reasonable person would not have made them. Moreover, defendant opened the door by introducing the topic on direct examination of the witness. Thus, cross-examination extended to all matters covered by direct examination. In addressing the death penalty issue, the court set aside the especially heinous, cruel, or depraved killing, an aggravating factor found in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(6). However, the aggravating factors of pecuniary gain, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(5), and multiple homicides, Ariz. Rev. Stat. 13-703(F)(8), were affirmed. The court also found that defendant's age was a statutory mitigator.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with two counts of intentional or knowing child abuse under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3623(B)(1). The trial court convicted the appellant of all charges and sentenced her to two consecutive 17-year prison terms that required her to serve the full 34 years before release. The Court of Appeals (Arizona) affirmed her convictions and sentence. The appellant challenged her sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellant had been, by all accounts, a very good mother. Shortly after her second child was born, her husband deserted her. Thereafter, she began dating. When she later broke up with her boyfriend, she moved out of the house they shared, although she had no income and no place to live. She was depressed, upset, and disillusioned. She attempted to commit suicide and infanticide by asphyxiation, but was interrupted by an alert neighbor. All survived and no one was injured. The appellant was convicted and alleged on appeal that her sentence for two counts of intentional or knowing child abuse was cruel and unusual under the federal and state constitutions. The court held that the appellant's sentence was not cruel and unusual. However, the court concluded that pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4037(B), the sentence was excessive in light of the circumstances of the particular crime. The court, therefore, reduced the appellant's sentence to the minimum statutory mitigated term of 24 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated that part of the court of appeals' opinion that related to the cruel and unusual punishment issue. The court affirmed the appellant's convictions, but reduced the 17-year term of imprisonment for each count to 12 years. The sentences in all other respects were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and kidnapping and sentenced to death. The court affirmed the convictions and sentences. The court held that the search warrant clearly indicated the basis for the police officer's belief that incriminating evidence would be found at defendant's residence and in his car. The court found that defendant's statements were voluntary because he thought he was helping himself when he provided the highly incriminating evidence. The search warrant authorized the police to detain defendant while the warrant was being executed but that the officers' actions went beyond detention and constituted an illegal arrest of defendant without probable cause. The court held that defendant's statements were not the fruit of the illegal arrest because the confession was voluntary, the proximity between the arrest and the statement was not immediate, and defendant understood he could end the interview and return home. The court found that both the heinous and depraved finding and the cruelty finding were proper aggravating factors and that defendant's intoxication was not a mitigating factor because it did not impair his ability to drive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that convicted defendant of premeditated first-degree murder and kidnapping and sentenced him to death.

He dumped her body in the woods and covered it with vegetation. He was convicted of murder, kidnapping, burglary, theft, forgery, and robbery, which convictions were affirmed on appeal. The court held that defendant waived his issue of severance of the robbery charge because he failed to renew his severance motion during trial. Although it was error that the robbery charge was not severed, defendant was not denied a fair trial by improper joinder because the evidence in the case was overwhelming. Certain improper answers by witnesses did not constitute prejudicial error because the trial court properly instructed the jury to disregard those comments. The court affirmed defendant's death sentence because the facts established aggravation and no mitigating circumstances were sufficiently substantial to have mandated leniency. Defendant, while a minor, understood the nature of his actions and his crime did not show immaturity or impulsivity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.

Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(2), because such an offense involved the use or threat of violence. The court also held that the trial court properly considered as an aggravating circumstance the fact that the murder was committed for pecuniary gain. The state proved that the receipt of money was a cause and motivation for the murder. Defendant did not meet his burden of proving that pretrial publicity required a change of venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's murder conviction and death sentence, holding that the trial court properly determined that defendant's murder of the victim for the expectation of pecuniary gain was properly considered an aggravating circumstance. Defendant further did not meet his burden of proving presumptive prejudice resulting from pretrial publicity, and thus the trial court properly overruled defendant's motion for change of venue.</SPAN></P>

The aggravating circumstance was adequately narrowed at the time of appellant's sentence; the subsequent caselaw merely finely combed for narrowing language and provided no construction of the aggravating circumstance. Appellant was precluded from claiming ineffective assistance of counsel for not presenting mitigating evidence because (1) he had presented this &quot;newly discovered evidence&quot; before and was precluded from presenting it again, and (2) to the extent that he had not raised ineffective assistance claims or presented evidence to which he had access in previous post-conviction proceedings, he had knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived the right to do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's appeal was automatic for his convictions for first degree murder, dangerous kidnapping, and dangerous armed robbery. Defendant was sentenced to death for the murder and sentenced to prison terms for the non-capital convictions. Defendant contended, among other things, that the Arizona trial court erred in admitting his statements to police detectives and in instructing the jury on felony murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was stopped, in her car, at an intersection when defendant's cohort pulled out a gun and ordered the victim to scoot over. Defendant and another cohort got in the vehicle. One cohort had previously told defendant that the cohort was going to get somebody's car, take them off in the middle of the desert, and shoot them, which was exactly what happened. As defendant watched from the car, the victim pleaded for her life, but was shot nonetheless. The court reviewed the record for fundamental error and, finding none, affirmed the convictions and sentences. Defendant was caught after he was found driving the victim's car. In his possession were the victim's ring, earrings, bank card, and credit card. The court found that the murder was committed for pecuniary gain and that the murder was especially cruel, given that the victim experienced mental anguish as to the uncertainty of her ultimate fate. However, the state did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder, at least as to defendant, was committed in an especially heinous or depraved manner, but the death penalty was, nonetheless, not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 16-year-old, and two accomplices carjacked the victim. Defendant drove the victim to a desert area where he shot her after she repeatedly pleaded for her life. The trial court convicted and sentenced defendant to death. The court affirmed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed the State to file its notice of intent to seek the death penalty, as required by Ariz. R. Crim. P. 15.1(g)(1), one day late because defendant was aware of the State's intent to seek the death penalty and was not prejudiced by the late filing. It was constitutional to sentence a 16-year-old individual to death. Defendant's motion for change of venue was properly denied because the pretrial publicity was not pervasive or outrageous. The State proved the aggravating circumstances that the crime was committed in a cruel, heinous, or depraved manner under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(6). Although defendant's age was a mitigating factor under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(G)(5), he was not entitled to leniency because he was intelligent and mature, was a major participant in the crime, acted with obvious deliberateness, and had a history of assaultive behavior.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases arising from two separate arrests, the trial court convicted defendant of two counts of aggravated assault on a peace officer, one count of disorderly conduct, and one count of resisting arrest. After the Court of Appeals (Arizona) affirmed, defendant filed a petition for review with the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's petition for review contended that the appellate court erred by declaring both Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4433(F) and Ariz. R. Crim. P. 39(b)(11) to be unconstitutional restrictions on the Victims' Bill of Rights, Ariz. Const. art II, &sect; 2.1. The issue presented was whether the provisions of &sect; 13-4433(F) and Rule 39(b)(11), which denied on-duty peace officers status as &quot;victims,&quot; unconstitutional because they conflicted with the definition of &quot;victim&quot; set forth in Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 2.1 (C). The court found that the constitutional provision in the case was not ambiguous. The authors of the Victims' Bill of Rights clearly defined victim and just as clearly defined two exceptions to victim status in Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 2.1 (C). The court further found that defendant presented no authority, nor was the court aware of any, which supported the proposition that a court was empowered to depart from the unambiguous language of a constitutional provision. The court concluded that the definition of victim in the Victims' Bill of Rights did not infringe on defendant's right to due process by denying him access to evidence favorable to an accused.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To the extent that they conflicted with the definition of the term &quot;victim&quot; as provided in the Victims' Bill of Rights, the statute and the rule were unconstitutional. The court agreed with the appellate court's resolution of the issue and affirmed the convictions and sentences of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for his role, together with a co-defendant, in several crimes that involved the abduction and killing of one person, the use of that person's ATM card to obtain money, the kidnapping of a couple, and the sexual abuse of the male member of the couple. At the time of sentencing, the trial court found the existence of three statutory aggravating factors and no mitigating factors. On appeal, defendant raised more than twenty points of error, many of which the court refused to consider because defendant either failed to include argument concerning the points in his brief or failed to make the necessary objection at the trial court level. The appellate court ultimately affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences, rejecting the remaining points of error raised by defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed a variety of issues, including the trial court's failure to suppress evidence, to grant a new trial based on juror misconduct, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the constitutionality of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no error in the denial of suppression of evidence or a new trial and that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. In reweighing the aggravating and mitigating factors considered in imposing the death penalty, the court found slightly more mitigating factors than the trial court but not sufficient to warrant leniency. There was ample evidence supporting the finding of probable cause to arrest defendant and the validity of the search warrant. Defendant's statements were properly admitted because the conditions of incarceration of which defendant complained were not sufficient to overcome his free will. Alleged juror misconduct was inconsequential in the absence of a showing of actual prejudice. In prior opinions, the court rejected all of defendant's arguments that the death penalty was unconstitutional. The restitution order was proper under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-603(C). The trial court's finding of an aggravating factor, that the murder was for pecuniary gain, was supported by the evidence. The trial court properly refused to find the mitigating circumstance of residual doubt because the verdict was supported by very strong evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff arrestee sought review of a judgment of the Court of Appeals, Division One (Arizona), that ordered the trial court to enter summary judgment for defendants, detectives, city, and county, on plaintiff's claims asserted under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Defendants had petitioned for relief by special action from an order of respondent superior court judge that denied their motions for summary judgment in plaintiff's tort action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff arrestee, who was incarcerated for nine months in spite of clear evidence of another's guilt, brought a tort action against defendants detectives, city, and county. Defendants sought summary judgment on plaintiff's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims. On review from the court of appeals, the court affirmed the order granting judgment in favor of defendants, city and detectives. The court held that defendant detectives, who had urged the prosecutor to drop the charges, were not liable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for any injury resulting from the prosecution. Because the detectives did not violate any of respondent's constitutional rights, their employer, the city, was not liable to plaintiff. Summary judgment in defendant county's favor was reversed. The court held that the court of appeals erred in entering summary judgment on issues not raised by the movant in the trial court and on which the parties had not had an opportunity to marshal and present evidence. The case was remanded to provide plaintiff with an opportunity to investigate whether the decision to continue his prosecution and to withhold exculpatory material was made by a county official with final policymaking authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order in plaintiff arrestee's tort action granting judgment in favor of defendants, city and detectives on plaintiff's claims. Because the record reflected genuine issues of material fact concerning defendant county' potential liability, the court vacated the court of appeals' opinion and its order directing entry of summary judgment in favor of defendant county.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the aggravating circumstance of &quot;especially heinous, cruel or depraved&quot; murder under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(6) resulting from (1) relishing of the murder, (2) gratuitous violence, and (3) the helplessness of the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed his former lover after an earlier assault and threats. The victim was cut or stabbed 34 times, was tied, beaten, and probably choked. On appeal, the court held that while an initial check-welfare sweep of the defendant's apartment was unlawful, a subsequent search under a warrant was lawful under the Fourth Amendment and the Arizona privacy provision, Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 8, under the independent source doctrine. The court found evidence of the prior assault was admissible under Ariz. R. Evid. 404(b) because its probative value as to motive outweighed any prejudice. The court independently reviewed aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the entire record to determine whether the death penalty was proper. The court held that evidence that defendant took the victim's car and went gambling in another state after the murder did not support a finding that he relished the murder. However, the court found there was ample evidence to support findings of helplessness and gratuitous violence, and the two together supported a finding of &quot;especially heinous, cruel or depraved&quot; murder. The court agreed that the mitigation evidence was insufficient to justify leniency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the convictions of murder and theft were proper. The court affirmed the trial court's finding of an aggravating circumstance and independently reviewed all the circumstances, reweighed the aggravating circumstance and the mitigating circumstances, and affirmed defendant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner asserted that both the lien and the credit were excessive. The administrative law judge held that the lien could not be reduced and the court of appeals affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a husband and wife, filed an action against defendant corporation, alleging that it sold them a defective and unreasonably dangerous power tool after a disc in a hand-held electric grinder shattered and injured plaintiff husband. Defendant asserted the product misuse defense and requested a jury charge on comparative fault. The trial court refused to instruct the jury on comparative negligence, and damages were awarded to plaintiffs. The court of appeals reversed and ordered a new trial on the ground that it was error not to give a jury charge on comparative fault. The court vacated parts of the court of appeals' opinion and remanded, holding that the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2505, did not constitute a limitation on damages. The court affirmed the order which held that the trial court erred in its refusal to give a jury charge on comparative fault because &sect; 12-2505 provided for the defense of product misuse in a strict liability case. The court held that the imposition of the product misuse defense to a comparative fault analysis did not violate Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 31 or the limitation clause of Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

The trial court convicted him of several crimes, including murder, and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the court found the convictions and sentences to be proper. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to sever or in allowing the first two women to identify defendant in court. The trial court properly ensured the jurors' impartiality. Defendant's statements to police were admissible because defendant's warrantless arrest was lawful and he knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his Miranda rights. Inflammatory photographs of the third woman were properly admitted even though defendant was willing to stipulate to the cause and manner of death. The jury instructions were proper. The trial court improperly used defendant's prior conviction of aggravated assault in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1204(A)(2) as an aggravating circumstance under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(2). Defendant's other prior convictions, however, involved the use or threat of violence. Defendant failed to present any statutory mitigating circumstance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murdering his former girlfriend. Five weeks later he robbed a convenience store and shot the cashier, whom he knew. She survived and testified against him. On appeal, the court considered defendant's trial issues. The trial court did not err by consolidating the two cases because they were properly consolidated as otherwise connected together in their commission within the meaning of Ariz. R. Evid. 13.3(a)(2). The trial court admitted prior bad acts evidence within Ariz. R. Evid. 404(b) (proper purpose), Ariz. R. Evid. 402 (relevance), Ariz. R. Evid. 403 (unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value), and Ariz. R. Evid. 105's (provision for an appropriate limiting instruction). A mistrial should not have been granted after a witness testified concerning defendant's prior bad acts because Ariz. R. Crim. P. 15 imposes no disclosure requirement. Preindictment delay did not deny defendant his right to a speedy trial or due process because his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial did not attach until he was indicted. Ariz. R. Evid. 615(3) was not violated when the trial court allowed the state two investigative witnesses.</SPAN></P>

The court considered all the issues that defendant raised and found that his convictions were proper.

The court searched the record and found no fundamental error.</SPAN></P>

While the court acknowledged the problems inherent in leaving the ultimate decision of life or death to human judgment, the court knew of no other way to accomplish the task and upheld the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(E). The court found that the murder was senseless beyond a reasonable doubt, but that the record did not support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that witness elimination motivated defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant broke into a residence, disassembled the stereo, was discovered by the resident, and fled. Minutes later defendant was standing on the stairs of a neighboring house holding the victims' VCR when they returned home. He attacked the victims, stole a purse from one of them, and stabbed them repeatedly, causing the death of one of them and seriously wounding the other. Defendant's first trial resulted in a hung jury. In his second trial, defendant was convicted of felony murder, aggravated assault, theft, armed robbery, and two counts of burglary. Defendant was sentenced to death on the murder conviction and to prison terms on the noncapital convictions. His appeal pursuant to Ariz. R. Crim. P. 26.15 and 31.2(b) and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4031 was automatic. The court affirmed his convictions because they were supported by the evidence, and the court found no error. Defendant's sentences also were affirmed, including his death sentence, because the state had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of aggravating circumstances pursuant to Ariz. Rev.

Plaintiffs' objection to employing the method was overruled, but plaintiffs' constitutional challenges were sustained. The court of appeals granted relief to defendants and the court vacated the opinion, holding that the periodic payment statutes violated Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 31 by limiting medical malpractice victims to a significantly less valuable remedy than would otherwise be available. The court stated that &sect; 31 represented a fundamental guaranty intended to have broad sweep to protect all injured persons, and that it could not ignore such an extraordinary protection. The court stated that any award for future damages could only be a reasonable guess, and when any estimate of future loss proved to be incorrect, common wisdom and sound public policy dictated that the error should inure to the benefit of the tort victim rather than the tortfeasor.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 13-703(C), (F), and the court agreed, finding that he had murdered for pecuniary gain but had not done so in a heinous and depraved fashion, &sect; 13-703(F)(5), (6). In reaching this decision, the court noted that the killing was senseless but was not done to eliminate a witness.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The death row inmate was on death row for over 20 years when the case was referred to the court from the trial court. The United States Supreme Court had granted his petition for habeas corpus unless the constitutional errors in the sentencing were corrected or a reduced sentence imposed on him, and remanded to the trial court. The trial judge sua sponte referred the case to the court. The court determined that the more efficient course was for it to reweigh the aggravating and mitigating factors to correct the constitutional error, rather than remand for a full sentencing hearing, even though ordinarily the trial court should conduct the reweighing. It had the authority to reweigh because the state conceded that a sentence reduction was preferable to a remand. It held that the aggravating factors of a prior felony and the commission of the crime in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner were improper. It held that the mitigation was more than de minimus. There was significant evidence of his changed character. It noted that under the sentencing requirements it was obligated to consider mental disorders and at the time of the murder he was under the influence of drugs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state, as real party in interest, initiated forfeiture proceedings pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-4305 to 13-4315 for monies seized under warrant from petitioner claimant's luggage. The claimant filed a timely claim that was struck by the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) for failure to comply with Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4311(E). The claimant filed a petition for special action, alleging that &sect; 13-4311E violated U.S. Const. amend. V.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In forfeiture proceedings, the court agreed with the claimant's contention that striking his claim for failure to comply with &sect; 13-4311E violated U.S. Const. amend. V and Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 10 by forcing him to choose between invoking the privilege against self-incrimination and contesting a forfeiture. The court declined, however, to strike down the statute as unconstitutional on its face. The court concluded that, by invoking his right against self-incrimination, the claimant lost the ability to intervene in the proceeding, virtually assuring a forfeiture. This effectively constituted an &quot;automatic&quot; economic sanction forbidden by the Fifth Amendment, as it impermissibly forced the claimant to choose between surrendering his constitutional privilege and forfeiting the property. As the claimant had a significant property interest, due process required a meaningful hearing. Acknowledging the state's need to protect against fraudulent claims, the court noted that the property at issue was taken directly from the claimant, thereby meeting the substantive concerns of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4311. Finding that the claimant's dismissal was unduly harsh, the court granted him standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of forfeiture, vacated the trial court's order, and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the state's scheme for financing public education, Ariz. Rev.

The parties did not dispute that there were enormous disparities in the districts as to the condition of buildings and classroom equipment. The court relied not on the state constitution's equal protection (or privileges and immunities) clause, Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 13, but the more specific state constitutional provisions regarding education, Ariz. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1, requiring the state to establish &quot;a general and uniform public school system.&quot; The court held that under Ariz. Const. art. XI the state, not the school districts, was obligated to maintain a school system. The requirement of &quot;general and uniform&quot; did not mandate equal funding but only sufficient funds to educate children on substantially equal terms. Disparities among districts caused by local control did not violate art. XI. Because the state's statutory system violated Ariz. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1, as the source of substantial disparities in financing education, the districts were entitled to a declaration that the scheme was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the analysis of aggravating and mitigating factors was properly made, but concluded that in the exercise of its obligation to sanction, in order to protect the public, it would add, as a pre-condition of reinstatement, that the attorney successfully complete a course in ethics at an accredited college of law, pass the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination, and complete the Professionalism Course offered by the Arizona State Bar.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner widow appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (Arizona), which reversed the superior court's award of summary judgment in her claim for surviving spouse benefits under decedent's retirement policy and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-801(C)(amended 1981). Respondent retirement plan argued that the widow was not entitled to the increased benefit enacted by statute after her husband's retirement and before his death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a state employee retired, the legislature amended the surviving spouse benefit under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-801(C). The original scheme gave surviving spouses one-third of the decedent's monthly benefits; the amended scheme gave them a two-thirds share. When the employee's widow applied for the two-thirds benefit, the retirement plan denied the claim and awarded only the benefit in effect before decedent's retirement. The superior court granted the widow's motion for summary judgment, but the court of appeals reversed. The court explained that the widow's benefits had vested at decedent's death and that decedent's benefits had vested when his employment began. Either way, the amended statute applied to increase the widow's benefit. The widow's contingent benefit had not vested at the time of the amendment, which altered a substantive right. Substantive rights could be altered before they vested. Alternately, decedent's benefits were altered after they had vested; however, when the change benefited both decedent and his widow, the change was presumed to be accepted by the beneficiaries. The court vacated the appellate decision and reinstated summary judgment for the widow.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the county board's request to reduce costs, the presiding judge of the county superior court issued the order that restricted public access to the courthouse for the remainder of the fiscal year. When the order took effect, the accused's trial was in its seventh week with proceedings conducted in the afternoon. The trial judge denied the accused's motions for a public trial or, in the alternative, to dismiss and for a stay of the proceedings until the court resolved the matter. In the special action, the court granted a local newspaper's request to appear as amicus curiae on its argument that the order unconstitutionally denied the press and the public access to observe trials. The court recognized the accused's right to a public trial and the public's right to observe court proceedings as guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. Noting the order's limited effect, the court held that the accused was not denied his right to a public trial and denied his request for a mistrial. However, vacating the order, the court held that it was an unconstitutional attempt to partially close the court, which was not case specific and violated the separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant workers' compensation claimant sought compensation benefits, but appellee workers' compensation insurance carrier denied her claim without explanation. Appellant filed an action against appellee, alleging bad faith.

Appellant sought review. The court reversed and remanded, holding that Ariz. Rev.

The court reviewed the statute's language, history, subject matter, legislative intent, its purpose and spirit and found nothing to indicate that the legislature had intended to preempt judicial jurisdiction over common law causes of action in the workers' compensation arena.

Likewise the court rejected defendant's contention that he had not possessed the mental state of &quot;knowingly&quot; because he believed that the victim was dead at the time of the sexual penetration. The court found sufficient evidence that defendant formed the intent to sexually assault the victim before her death, and overwhelming evidence supported the jury's verdict. The court said the DNA evidence was properly admitted as identity was not at issue, and the parties stipulated to its admission at trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff decedent's parents filed an action for wrongful death against defendants, liquor licensee and related parties, seeking to recover damages for their son's death in an alcohol-related automobile accident. They alleged that defendant related parties negligently failed to supervise their own son and permitted him to steal liquor. The appellate court vacated the trial court's dismissal of the complaint based on the immunity granted liquor licensees under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4-312(B) and declared the statute unconstitutional. The court granted review on the statute's constitutionality, but vacated on other grounds, ruling that Arizona's social host and dram shop legislation did not apply. It declared that the case was a matter of common law negligence. It found that defendant liquor licensee, which had notice that minors had access to and were stealing its alcohol, had a duty to take reasonable precautions for the safety of the general public. The theft of the alcohol was not an intervening cause that broke the chain of proximate causation because the subsequent chain of events leading to the accident was foreseeable.</SPAN></P>

As a matter of common law negligence, defendant liquor licensee owed the general public a duty of to prevent minors from stealing its alcohol. The theft of the liquor did not break the causation chain.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant waived any objection to the excusal of a venireperson for cause both by failing to object and by expressly approving the panel, and that it was not improper to excuse the juror based on his views about the death penalty. The court found that the incomplete motive instruction was not fundamental error. The court held that defendant should not have been convicted of a separate child abuse offense based upon the premeditated murder of her child. The court found that the death sentence was proper, even though defendant was not personally the trigger-person and even though the aggravating circumstance of pecuniary gain was inapplicable, because the crime was especially heinous and depraved, the victim was under the age of 15, and the mitigating circumstances were de minimis. The judgment was vacated in part, and affirmed in part.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the brief exposure of a handcuffed defendant to members of the jury outside the courtroom was not inherently prejudicial. The police were authorized to seize items not listed on the search warrant because they were in plain sight, the court held that the state was not required to equalize the resources of the indigent and the wealthy, and the testimony would not have changed the outcome of the trial because the evidence was overwhelming that defendant forcibly took his wife to the desert with the intent to kill her or assist in killing her.</SPAN></P>

The expectation of pecuniary gain was among the causes of the victim's death, and thus the aggravating factor of pecuniary gain was established. The death penalty was appropriate for felony murder, because defendant was a major participant in the burglary.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, ruling that the statute effected an unconstitutional taking without just compensation, granted the landowner's motion. Thereafter, the town sought an injunction against the landowners, but such injunction was denied. The town appealed, and the court of appeals held that &sect; 28-1861(B) was constitutional. The court then granted the landowners' petition for review to determine whether &sect; 28-1861(B) was a curative statute or whether &sect; 28-1861(B) transferred to the state title to land that was used for roadways for specified periods beginning before January 1, 1960. On ruling, the court held that the statute was constitutional and that it was curative. The court held that the statute did not overrule the Arizona common law prohibition against the creation of public highways by prescription. Thus, the court vacated the court of appeals' decision and remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners sought damages for a taking of land along a state highway as a result of runoff water discharged onto their property. The state's defense was that the property had been acquired by the state either through prescription or through the operation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1861(B). The property owners claimed that the statute was only curative or, in the alternative, was unconstitutional. After the trial court granted partial summary judgment to the property owners, a division of the court of appeals issued an opinion in another case stating that &sect; 28-1861(B) was constitutional and that it transferred title to roadways to the state as a result of longstanding public use. The state then filed a special action with the court after the trial court declined to reconsider its partial summary judgment. The court agreed with the trial court and denied relief to the state. The court held that 1) Arizona law did not permit the creation of public highways by prescription and, therefore, the property owners did not lose their rights before the enactment of the statute; 2) the statute did not alter the common law; and 3) the statute was curative only.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the victim had endured great suffering over a relatively protracted period of time while she struggled for her life and determined that her murder was cruel. The court further held that the crime was heinous and depraved because the victim was helpless and defendant inflicted gratuitous violence on her. Intoxication was only a mitigating factor under Ariz. Rev.

The court held that the trial was not corrupted by pretrial publicity and that defendant was not denied a fair trial. The court found that the written questionnaire addressed many of the questions that might normally have militated in favor of in camera voir dire and that defendant waived his right to be present during voir dire. Defendant's prior offense was not too remote in time to be admissible. The lab's match criteria was generally accepted in the relevant scientific community and complied with Frye. Admission of flight and concealment evidence was not error, and there was substantial evidence to warrant conviction. Defendant's confrontation rights were not violated because challenged testimony fit within the excited utterance hearsay exception. The foundation for the tracking evidence was adequate, and testing of defendant's clothes was allowed as the authorities merely tested that which had properly come into their possession. A statement by the prosecutor, though improper, was not fundamental error. Aggravating circumstances were present, and there was no mitigating evidence; thus the death sentence was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree felony murder, aggravated robbery, and kidnapping, in the death of a police deputy. Defendant was sentenced to death on the felony murder count, and periods of incarceration for the remaining two counts. Defendant, who was 18 years old at the time of the murder, asserted 10 points of alleged error in his automatic appeal, including several challenges to the trial court's imposition of the death penalty. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in determining that defendant's age, a statutory mitigating circumstance, and dysfunctional family background, a non-statutory mitigating circumstance, were not sufficiently substantial to call for leniency. The appellate court found that the trial court did not err in concluding that the two mitigating circumstances were insufficient to call for leniency, but that a third mitigating circumstance, duress, which was rejected by the trial court, required a reduction of defendant's sentence. The appellate court reduced defendant's sentence based on the fact that defendant, who shot the deputy at his father's direction, was under duress or coercion at the time of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree felony murder, aggravated robbery, and kidnapping, and was sentenced to death as a result of his involvement in the shooting of a police deputy. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that defendant's instruction to an accomplice to grab the deputy's gun while defendant was wrestling with the deputy was sufficient to establish defendant's liability for aggravated robbery. The court further determined that the murder of the deputy was in furtherance of the robbery pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1105(A)(2) because the murder prevented the deputy from regaining his gun. The court found that the murder conviction was properly premised on the kidnapping because the two crimes were not conceptually identical and did not occur as part of the same act. The court agreed with the trial judge's finding that defendant was an active participant in the murder based upon the fact that defendant shouted &quot;shoot him&quot; to encourage his accomplice to complete the crime. The court also determined that the death penalty was properly imposed because the deputy endured both physical abuse and unimaginable mental anguish before being shot.</SPAN></P>

By expressly stating in &sect; 12-529 that statutes of limitations did apply to political subdivisions of the state in claims involving the navigability of watercourses, the legislature tacitly acknowledged that statutes of limitations did not apply to political subdivisions of the state in other types of cases. Moreover, the court held that the activities of the school district had not removed it from the protection of &sect; 12-510.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner State Compensation Fund (fund) filed a special action directly with the court seeking to have Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-987(1), (2), (3) declared unconstitutional. Those provisions amended requirements regarding the calculation of federal equivalency tax and also imposed an annual alternate minimum tax. The respondent state officials asserted the provisions' validity and urged the court's non-acceptance of special jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court accepted special jurisdiction in this action to allow the state officials to take timely action regarding budgetary matters. The legislature adopted statutory amendments requiring the fund to retroactively pay an annual alternative minimum tax in an attempt to balance the state's budget. The fund asserted that the challenged provisions required a tax assessment and violated Arizona Constitution provisions. The court accepted jurisdiction over the special action and determined that the provisions requiring the alternative minimum tax were invalid because Ariz. Const. art. IV, pt. 2, &sect; 19(9) provided that special legislation could not be enacted to assess or collect taxes. The court also found that there was no identified rational basis for the state legislature to have &quot;singled out&quot; the fund and that the discriminatory imposition of the tax did not rationally further the goal of balancing the state's budget. The federal equivalency tax was found to be not severable from the alternative minimum tax and was, therefore, also found to be invalid.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the statements he made to police officers because he had been advised of his Miranda rights and appeared to understand them. The court determined that defendant's statements were voluntary because the allegedly coercive police tactic occurred after defendant had admitted that he had struck his son. The court found that the admission of photographs of the dead child with resuscitation equipment still attached were relevant to prove child abuse and were not unduly inflammatory given the atrocity of the crime. The court ruled that the trial court's error in excluding the testimony of defendant's character witnesses was harmless because the prosecution would have been able to impeach defendant with his recent conviction of child molestation. The trial court properly imposed the death penalty because the child consciously experienced physical and mental pain before dying, the murder was senseless, and the child was helpless.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that testimony presented by police officers was properly admitted. The court ruled that defendant was not mentally challenged and functioned adequately in society. The court rejected defendant's ineffective counsel claim as it related to the admissibility of defendant's inculpatory statements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that: (1) a criminalist was not an undeclared witness because the defense counsel overlooked her report in his pretrial preparation; (2) defendant failed to demonstrate the probability that his trial was unfair when he argued that his trial was tainted by publicity before and during his trial; (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a photograph of the victim where it was introduced to aid the medical examiner's testimony and was probative on the issue of intent: (4) a detective's footprint testimony was admissible because he had been trained in tracking and had investigated numerous burglarized premises to determine points of entry; (5) the trial court's rejection of expert testimony on the effects of intoxication was proper because such knowledge was within the common knowledge and experience of the jury; (6) the jury was properly instructed; and (7) a first-degree murder verdict is not constitutionally deficient unless there is a unanimous jury finding on a single theory of first degree murder.

The jury was given instructions from the Amfac risk capital test. The court of appeals reversed conviction because the fact-specific test of Amfac was too uncertain. The state contended that Arizona's statutory scheme was clear and no exemption applied. The court held that the Amfac risk capital test did not apply. Further, the court held that defendants were advised to register the notes before they sold them under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-1841, and to register themselves under Ariz. Rev.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1405.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In initial appellate proceedings, the court found that defendant's 40-year sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. The United States Supreme Court vacated our that ruling and remanded for further consideration. The facts showed that the sexual acts for which defendant was prosecuted were with consenting underage girls. Violence was not a factor of the crimes, and defendant had no prior record. Nevertheless, the state invoked the provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-604(H) and 13-604.01, which required the trial court to impose mandatory consecutive sentences on the two counts. This resulted in a 40-year sentence without the possibility of parole, and, on remand, the court again found that this constituted cruel and unusual when applied to the facts. This was because the penalty was grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the Arizona Corporation Commission (commission) and commissioners, proposed rules that required intervenor public service corporations to report information about and obtain permission for transactions with their parents, subsidiaries, and other affiliated corporations. Respondent state attorney general refused to certify the rules. Petitioners brought a special action in which they claimed that respondent thereby failed to perform a duty required by &sect; 41-1041 of Arizona's Administrative Procedure Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-1041. The court held that respondent violated &sect; 41-1041 because Ariz. Const. art. 15, &sect; 3 gave petitioner commission the authority to promulgate the proposed rules. The court found that petitioner commission had &quot;full power&quot; under the constitution to regulate, set rates, and make reasonable rules for public service companies. The court held that the proposed rules were reasonably connected to and necessary for petitioner commission's constitutional exclusive ratemaking power and were within its discretionary authority.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants pled guilty to sex offenses that occurred before the effective date of the sex offender registration statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3821, and each was ordered to register. One panel of the Court of Appeals (Arizona) determined that the application was an ex post facto law and reversed it. Another panel determined that registration did not violate the ex post facto clause. The state and the second defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants in the consolidated cases committed conduct prior to the enactment of the sex offender registration statute but entered guilty pleas after its effective date. The trial courts, as part of the sentences, ordered registration under the statute. One panel of the court of appeals held that the application of the registration requirement to crimes predating its enactment violated the ex post facto clause of the Arizona Constitution. A different panel of the court of appeals held that registration as a sex offender for offenses committed before the enactment of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3821 did not violate the ex post facto clause. The court granted review in both cases to resolve the conflict between the two decisions. The court determined that &sect; 13-3821 had the primary purpose of enabling law enforcement personnel to locate child sexual offenders. Although there were punitive results, the statute was regulatory in nature and was not an unconstitutional ex post facto law when applied to defendants who were convicted after the enactment of the statute for offenses predating the enactment of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined, on balance, that requiring convicted sex offenders to register pursuant to the statute was not punishment. Consequently, the retrospective application of the statute to defendants did not violate the ex post facto clauses of the United States or Arizona Constitutions. Therefore, the court affirmed the decision of the court of appeals that held that the statute did not violate the ex post facto clauses.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, even though the skeletal remains of the girl, discovered long after her disappearance, did not reveal a cause of death, the extensive circumstantial evidence was sufficient to satisfy the corpus delicti requirement and to support the murder conviction. Defendant failed to show that his counsel's conduct was insufficient or unreasonable, and he did not establish that he was prejudiced by any alleged errors. The death penalty statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev.

P. 26.15, 31.2(b), defendant appealed an order of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which following remand, imposed the death penalty for first-degree murder. Three prior reviews upheld all of defendant's convictions and sentences expect for the death penalty that was imposed on the murder count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed and murdered the victim in his home and injured a neighbor who tried to help. After two reviews, the court remanded and directed the trial court to consider at the sentencing the two additional mitigating circumstances of defendant showing that he was capable of rehabilitation and that the drug addiction significantly impaired his capacity to conform his conduct to the law's mandates. The trial court resentenced defendant to death and on appeal, the court affirmed. First, the mitigating factors were not sufficiently substantial to call for leniency. Second, a finding of a mitigating circumstance under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;13-703(G)(1) did not negate the finding of an aggravating circumstance under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(6). Third, Arizona's death penalty was constitutional because proportionality reviews were not constitutionally mandated, it was not unconstitutional to allow the judge, not the jury, to determine the existence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and the statute provided constitutionally adequate standards to guide sentencing discretion. Fourth, double jeopardy or collateral estoppel did not bar reimposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the torture and first-degree murder of two victims, and sentenced to death. A codefendant agreed to testify against defendant in return for a plea agreement. On appeal, he contended that the trial court erred in numerous respects, including a violation of defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and failing to consider the disparity of defendant's sentence with that received by his codefendant as a mitigating factor against the death penalty. The appellate court found that defendant had not been denied his right to counsel. Defendant made a successful motion prior to trial to proceed in propria persona, and the appellate court found no error in the trial court's decisions to disallow defendant's jailhouse lawyer to accompany him at trial, or in denying defendant hybrid representation, a right not recognized in Arizona. The appellate court also found, in the process of rejecting defendant's allegations, that defendant's sentence was not so disproportionate to that received by his codefendant to act as a mitigating factor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the lower court's judgment and imposition of sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sentenced appellant to death sentences for first degree murder, burglary, theft, and arson. On appeal, the court held that the trial judge, for purposes of aggravation, properly considered the presentence report as to all counts except for the murder counts, and validly considered the victim impact statements in the presentence report when he sentenced appellant on the other counts. Further, the court held that the evidence supported the finding that the crime was committed in an especially cruel manner. The victims, a mother and her daughter, were forced to lie face down while appellant robbed their house. The mother was shot in the leg and some time later, both mother and daughter were shot and killed execution style. The court held that appellant's participation in the crime was substantial and his actions were deliberate. Not only did he plan the robbery two weeks before hand, he alone executed the two women. Appellant's age was insufficient to call for leniency when weighed against the aggravating factors. The court affirmed the death sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, injured employee and family, brought a negligence action in Pima County Superior Court (Arizona), against defendant electric companies. The electric companies named the employer as a nonparty at fault. The injured employee then brought a motion to strike the designation of the employer as a nonparty at fault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured employee argued that under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2501(H), an employer liable for workers' compensation could not be considered a nonparty at fault. The court held that the later enacted provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2506(B), which compelled the assessment of nonparty fault regardless of whether the nonparty was or could have been made a defendant to the action, prevailed over the provision in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2501(H), which prohibited assessment against immune employers. The court held that the construction given to the statutes did not violate the Ariz. Const. art 2, &sect; 31, and art. 18, &sect; 6, which prohibited abrogation of a cause of action for injury and prohibited limitations on the amount of damages to be recovered for causing death or injury to any person. The court held that the injured employee was effectively prevented from recovering damages against his employer because he had already recovered from the employer under the workers' compensation law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answer the certified question and held that when an employer negligently contributed to an employee's injury, the joint tortfeasors may require the employer's negligence to be considered for the assessment of fault under state statutes. The court left the assessment of costs to the discretion of the district judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the employee was discharged from her position with the state supreme court, she filed a complaint with the board. The state supreme court and its administrative director filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the board did not have jurisdiction to consider whistle blowing complaints involving court employees. The board denied the motion. Thereafter, the state supreme court and its administrative director filed a complaint with the trial court seeking an order directing the board to dismiss the employee's complaint. The trial court denied the relief requested. The lower court held that the motion to dismiss should have been granted. On appeal, the court held that by enacting Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-532(I), the legislature attempted to grant the board the right to directly interfere with the court's administrative decisions concerning the tenure of employees. That interference was contrary to Ariz. Const. art. 6, &sect; 7, and the statute was unconstitutional. The lower court correctly concluded that the board lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county contended it was authorized to regulate nonconforming uses of land within its boundaries.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sign owner appealed a decision by a city zoning administrator (city), that a sign he had erected was not properly oriented, to the city board of adjustment (board), which affirmed the city. The superior court affirmed the board, but held that the sign owner had raised a vested rights issue before the board and ordered a trial de novo. The Court of Appeals (Arizona) affirmed. The city sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city had determined that a sign the sign owner had erected did not conform with Kingman, Ariz., Zoning Ord. 135, &sect; XXV, Off-Premise Sign, &sect; 5, in that it was not properly oriented to the road on the zoning request. The sign owner was not represented before the board and his appeal only addressed the issue of orientation. In reversing the court of appeals, the court noted that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-462.06(D) required that a person seeking review of a decision of a zoning administrator file a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. While the statute did not require that the notice of appeal specify the precise legal theory or theories upon which an appellant relied, it must, in some fashion, give fair notice of what would be challenged on appeal. The court held that by failing to assert a vested rights issue in his notice of appeal or otherwise, the sign owner had waived that issue. Once the trial court concluded that the board had not abused its discretion in upholding the city's decision concerning the orientation of the sign, the case should have ended.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, finding that it was not necessary for police officers to obtain a separate search warrant for the tape when the warrant's scope included all evidence that pertained to the murder. The tape was properly admitted because a proper foundation was laid and because the trial court, in the exercise of its judicial discretion, was satisfied that the recording was accurate, authentic, and generally trustworthy. The tape did not violate defendant's right to confrontation because the declarant was unavailable and the statements were reliable under the circumstances. Imposition of the death sentence was proper because the record showed that defendant committed the murders in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner. Cruelty was established because the record showed that defendant inflicted mental anguish or physical abuse before the victims died.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his lover conspired to and did murder the lover's husband in order to collect insurance proceeds. Defendant was convicted for first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder by the Superior Court of Yavapai County, Arizona. On a finding of the aggravating factor of a pecuniary motive, defendant was sentenced to death, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. 13-703(E). Defendant appealed from the conviction and the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In affirming the order of conviction and sentence, the court rejected the claim that the trial court erred in instructing the jury, holding that 1) it was the trial court's duty to determine the existence of a conspiracy, so defendant's proposed instruction was incorrect, 2) for the same reason, defendant was not denied a jury trial on the conspiracy issue, and 3) the trial court correctly denied defendant's proposed instruction on the jury's role in determining the admissibility of co-conspirator's statements. In addition, the conspiracy did not end at the murder, but embraced the collection of the insurance proceeds, so the lover's statements after the murder fell within the co-conspirator hearsay exception. Although the admission of defendant's bigamy was error, it was not prejudicial. The court found that, because defendant's sentence was death for murder, there was no double punishment under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-116. Finally, the court found there was no error or unconstitutionality in the imposition of the death sentence, because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(E) mandates death for a murder with aggravating circumstances, not balanced by mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city unanimously approved the rezoning of the owner's property.

The trial court ruled that the referendum petitions were sufficient and that the matter should be submitted to the city's voters. On review, the court reversed. The petitions did not comply with Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 1, &sect; 1(9) and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-112(B), and the defect was not cured. The petitions were insufficient to require an election. Because the referendum was an &quot;extraordinary&quot; power, that permitted a minority to hold up the effective date of legislation that could represent the wishes of the majority, the Arizona Supreme Court required referendum proponents to comply strictly with applicable constitutional and statutory provisions. The circulators' affidavits failed to state, as both Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 1, &sect; 1(9) and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-112(B) specifically required, that the circulators believed each signer to be a qualified elector of the city.</SPAN></P>

The court had original jurisdiction under Ariz. Sup. Ct. R. 53(e). Ariz. Code of Prof'l Responsibility R. 29(a), not Ariz. Rules of Prof'l Conduct R. 42, was applicable.</SPAN></P>

Code of Prof'l Responsibility DR 9-102 because he did not preserve the identity of funds and property of a client but the commission's two-year probation was insufficient and the court imposed an additional two year suspension; (3) because the attorney actively frustrated restitution for his client, and because of the manner in which the attorney contested this matter, the suspensions ran consecutively; and (4) the attorney was entitled to be represented by counsel but not appointed counsel.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, and the court vacated her conviction, finding &sect; 16-242 and the applicable definitional sections unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Section 16-242 was vague because it did not give fair warning to persons as to what attire and movements were prohibited. There was no standard for determining what &quot;various degrees of undress&quot; contemplated. Further, &sect; 16-242 was overbroad because it infringed upon First Amendment rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendant was not in custody at the time of his confession and that even though defendant invoked his right to decline further interrogation until he had spoken to a lawyer, the police were entitled to continue to question him because it was a non-custodial setting. The court rejected defendant's contention that the magistrate who issued the search warrant was not neutral and detached because he went to the crime scene to sign the warrant. The court found that under the unique circumstances of the case there was no error. The court noted, however, that normally it did not approve of magistrates visiting crime scenes. The court agreed with the trial court's conclusion that defendant and his father voluntarily consented to the search and, therefore, it rejected defendant's challenge to the search on lack of consent grounds. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was deprived of a fair trial because it found that defendant failed to show either outrageous publicity or resulting prejudice from the media coverage. Finally, the court upheld the death sentence, finding that the murder of the child was committed in a particularly depraved manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state, a real party in interest, challenged a decision from the Court of Appeals (Arizona), which granted petitioner special action relief from an assessment of attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner received court-appointed counsel to defend her against a criminal charge. The magistrate ordered petitioner to pay $ 100 toward attorney's fees in $ 20 per month installments. Petitioner paid $ 60 of the assessment. Petitioner's counsel filed a motion to vacate the attorney's fee assessment, which was denied by the superior court. Petitioner was granted a special action relief by the court of appeals. The court reviewed the constitutionality of Ariz. R. Crim. P. 6.7(d). Under rule 6.7(d), petitioner was entitled to court-appointed counsel that was not state provided because she was considered to be quasi-indigent. Further, rule 6.7(d) authorized the court to order the petitioner to contribute to her defense costs. This type of order did not impair the petitioner's right to counsel. Moreover, the limitation imposed by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-584(B) did not restrict the court's authority to order partial payment of legal expenses by petitioner. If she felt that the amount assessed by the magistrate was unreasonable; petitioner was entitled to file a motion for reconsideration at the end of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the court of appeals' decision and affirmed the decision rendered by the trial court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted child molestation. Defendant was sentenced to lifetime supervised probation on the first count and to a mitigated term of imprisonment on the second count. The Court of Appeals (Arizona) remanded the case to consider the validity of imposing lifetime probation under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604.01(I). The state petitioned the court to determine the constitutionality of the provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that although it had previously determined that imposing lifetime parole unconstitutionally violated separation of powers, the power to make decisions regarding probation was solidly within the scope of the judiciary's authority. The court said that unlike the lifetime parole provision, which impermissibly created an intertwining of judicial and executive powers, the lifetime probation provision caused no such overlap. Accordingly, the court found that &sect; 13-604.01(I) did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. Similarly, the court held that &sect; 13-604.01(I) was not unconstitutionally vague. The court said that unlike the lifetime parole provision, under which the penalty for violating parole was uncertain, the penalty for violating probation was revocation, modification, or continuation of probation. The court concluded that &sect; 13-604.01(I) was constitutional and valid. Therefore, it vacated that portion of the intermediate court's order that remanded the matter to the trial court. The court affirmed the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) sentenced defendant to death for the murder and to life imprisonment, without the possibility of parole for 25 years, for the burglary. The court reviewed the judgment automatically pursuant to Ariz. Const. art. 6, &sect; 5(3) and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-4031, 13-4033.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was in the course of committing a burglary at a residence when the homeowners, a man and his fiancee, returned. The man jumped out of his car, armed with a gun, and confronted defendant. While the fiancee was talking on her car phone with an emergency operator, defendant shot the man in the chest. The man died from his wounds. Defendant was indicted on charges of first-degree murder, attempted murder, and burglary. The court held that (1) the fiancee's in-court identification of defendant was tainted by an unduly suggestive pre-trial identification procedure, but the identification was nonetheless admissible because it bore indicia of reliability and had a source independent of the pre-trial viewing, (2) the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of a prior burglary in area because the State presented substantial circumstantial evidence that defendant committed the burglary, (3) the trial court erred in using defendant's prior convictions for aggravated assault and robbery to establish the &quot;prior felony involving violence &quot; aggravating circumstance, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(2), and (4) death sentence was disproportionate to penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's murder conviction, reduced the death sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for at least 25 years, and ordered that his life sentence on the murder charge was to be served consecutively with his life sentence on the burglary charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of and sentenced for various crimes, including the first degree murder of a pregnant woman. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Defendant first argued that he was incompetent to stand trial. The court disagreed, and held that the trial court adequately ensured defendant's competency, noting defendant's lack of cooperation with his counsel. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in denying his requests for continuances, as he failed to show prejudice resulting from the denials. Additionally, the court held that the trial court did not commit clear and manifest error in finding defendant's confession voluntary. However, the trial court's jury instruction regarding transferred intent was deemed erroneous. The court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1103(A)(5) precluded the doctrine of transferred intent because it explicitly required two mental states, one toward the mother, and the other toward the unborn child. Because the court could not be sure whether the verdict was based on the incorrect instruction, defendant's manslaughter conviction was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-471. The statute was challenged as an allegedly prohibited special or local statute under Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 2, &sect; 19(20).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant municipalities argued that the deannexation statute was unconstitutional. The superior court upheld the statute in both actions, and one court of appeals affirmed, while the other reversed. The court found the statute unconstitutional. The statute, which was aimed at remedying problems stemming from abusive annexation practices, affected a limited class of cities for a limited period of time. The statute was, therefore, a special or local law. Although it was rationally related to a legitimate legislative goal, and it, therefore, satisfied the equal protection test, it did not meet the two special/local law standards. Namely, it did not apply uniformly to all members of the class, it was not elastic, it excluded similarly situated members of the class, and a general law could have been made applicable. As such, the deannexation statute violated Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 2, &sect; 19(20). The remaining portions of the statute, however, were severable and remained in force.</SPAN></P>

The court found venue proper and also determined that the trial court was not required to strike for cause two jurors who had been exposed to prejudicial pretrial publicity. The court held that, although the prosecutor's closing argument was inflammatory, the error was harmless because the evidence of guilt was overwhelming. The court affirmed the death sentence, rejecting a constitutional challenge to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703 and upholding the findings as to aggravating circumstances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Injured passengers filed a negligence action against a city and state for injuries sustained in a car accident. The city and state alleged that the driver was intoxicated at the time of the accident, and raised Ariz. Rev.

The injured passengers sought to strike the defense. The trial court declared &sect; 12-820.03(2)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The city and state petitioned the court of appeals, which vacated the trial court's order, holding that &sect; 12-820.03(2) was constitutional. The injured passengers appealed. The court found that &sect; 12-820.03(2) was a legislative codification of the doctrine of contributory negligence because it provided an absolute bar to recovery of damages by a particular category of persons who otherwise could proceed with an action for damages. Because Ariz. Const. art.

In both cases, consolidated for appeal, the courts of appeals affirmed the denial of Ariz. R. Civ. P. 60(c) relief but in one case the court of appeals reversed the denial of relief under the savings statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-504.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two cases were consolidated on appeal. In both cases, the complaints were dismissed for lack of prosecution under Ariz. Sup. Ct. R. V(e). In the first case, the trial court denied plaintiff's request for relief under Ariz. R. Civ. P. 60(c) and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-504, the state's savings statute, and the court of appeals affirmed. In the second case, the trial court also denied plaintiff's' motion for relief under Ariz. R. Civ. P. 60(c) and under the savings statute but a different department of the same division of the court of appeals reversed the denial of relief under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-504. The court determined that whether the facts establish good cause under Ariz. Sup. Ct. R. V(e)(2) was a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court and affirmed that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate good cause to continue the case on the inactive calendar and, therefore, did not demonstrate that they were entitled to relief. The court found, however, that the plaintiffs in the second case had satisfied their burden of establishing grounds for relief under Rule 60(c)(6), and the trial court abused its discretion in denying relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the courts of appeals and the trial courts dismissing the personal injury actions and found that the denial of the request for relief under Arizona's savings statute in one case was proper because plaintiff failed to diligently pursue his action. The court, however, vacated the judgment of dismissal in the other case, finding that relief from judgment was appropriate under the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure.</SPAN></P>

The intermediate court affirmed the sentence, and defendant sought review. The court vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. The court examined the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty, made a comparison of other sentences imposed in the same jurisdiction for more serious crimes, and made a comparison of sentences in other jurisdictions for the same crime. Under the analysis, it found that the sentence as applied to defendant violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII and the comparable state prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.

The court held that defendant's consecutive sentences totaling 46 years for trafficking drugs to a minor under 15 years of age and trafficking in stolen property were not cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The court found that Arizona's legislature created stiffer penalties for persons who committed crimes against children, including drug offenses. The court found that defendant's 25-year sentence for selling marijuana to a minor without early release was proper. The court found that defendant, age 21, was convicted of a total of six felonies since age 17. The court found defendant had a pattern of illegal activity and that public safety was at risk when defendant was at liberty. The court found that attempts to change defendant's behavior through probation, both as a juvenile and an adult, failed.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1404. The juvenile delinquent challenged the applicability of &sect; 13-1404 to minors and argued that &sect; 13-1404 was overly broad and vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile delinquent's probation was revoked upon a juvenile court's finding that the juvenile delinquent had touched the breasts of a 14-year-old girl. The juvenile court held that the sexual contact had constituted sexual abuse under &sect; 13-1404, despite the girl's consent. The appellate court affirmed the revocation of the juvenile delinquent's probation. On further appeal, the court also affirmed. Specifically, the court rejected the juvenile delinquent's arguments that &sect; 13-1404 was unconstitutionally vague or overly broad, holding that the statute was explicit and unambiguous in its language, provided clearly ascertainable standards of guilt, and did not promote arbitrariness. The court also held that the juvenile delinquent's constitutional right to privacy did not entitle him to engage in sexual contact with a partner under the age of 15, and thus &sect; 13-1404 was not unconstitutional as applied. Finally, the court determined that the juvenile delinquent's policy arguments against application of &sect; 13-1404 to juvenile defendants were matters within the legislature's, not the court's, purview.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner construction company submitted the lowest bid for a city project, but a competing contractor was awarded the bid after it was determined that under Ariz.

Petitioner then filed for review of the lower court's decision and sought a determination of &sect; 34-241 as unconstitutional. The court noted that because petitioner and the competing contractor had settled, the controversy between them was moot, but because the issue was one of public importance that was likely to recur, it considered the petition. After applying the rational basis test, the court concluded that &sect; 34-241 had been so altered by amendment that the financial burden it imposed, the discrimination it effected, and the privileges it conferred were no longer rationally related to any legitimate state purpose. The statute violated the equal protection guarantee of Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 13. The judgment of the lower court was vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner injured parties presented special action petitions that challenged the venue rulings of respondent, the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), in the injured parties' actions against real party in interest, the State of Arizona (state). The superior court allowed the state to transfer venue of the injured parties' actions to Maricopa County pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-822(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-822(B) granted the state attorney general discretion, once an action against the state was filed, to change the venue to Maricopa County. The state contended that a transfer to Maricopa County pursuant to &sect; 12-822(B) preempted a later transfer for cause under &sect; 12-406, which allowed for changes of venue if the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would have been promoted by the change, or for other good and sufficient cause. The court disagreed and held that the injured parties were not precluded from seeking a venue change for cause under &sect; 12-406 after the state obtained transfer to Maricopa County. The court reasoned that there was no legislative intent in &sect; 12-822(B) to abrogate the general venue statutes in actions against the state and noted that venue was proper in the counties where the injured parties filed their actions. Although &sect; 12-411(A) prohibited more than one change of venue per action, the change of venue at the instance of the state under &sect; 12-822(B) was not encompassed in &sect; 12-411(A)'s restriction. In so ruling, the court did not reach the question of the constitutionality of &sect; 12-822(B). Thus, the court remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The court held that the duty of the State to preserve evidence was limited to evidence that might be expected to play a significant role in the suspect's defense. The court concluded that the chances were extremely low that any of the evidence which was not preserved would have been exculpatory for the defendant. As a result, the court found that he was not so seriously prejudiced by the loss of the evidence that he did not receive a fair trial. The defendant also argued that his previous conviction for second degree murder did not involve violence and that it was an accident involving consenting homosexual partners. The court accepted the trial court's finding that the total mitigation present was not sufficient to overcome any one of the aggravating circumstances, thus, no error occurred.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been driving with less than .20 percent alcohol weight in her blood and had caused no personal injury. The municipal judge sentenced defendant pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692.01(D). The superior court remanded the case on appeal for resentencing. The lower court affirmed the judgment of conviction and a sentence that did not take the mitigating circumstances into account. The court vacated the judgment and reinstate the sentence imposed by the municipal judge. Section 28-692.01(C) required a prosecutorial allegation in order for a judge to apply &sect; 28-692.01(D). The legislature overreached its power given to it in Ariz. Const. art. III. This restricted the power of the judiciary to perform its constitutional mandate. To that extent, &sect; 28-692.01(C) was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the trial court erroneously relied on a prior conviction for assault with intent to commit violence as an aggravating factor, because a probation officer's testimony identifying defendant as the person convicted fell short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt as required by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(C). The court found that the evidence that the killing was committed to avoid detection supported the finding of the aggravating factor of commission of murder for pecuniary gain and the finding of the aggravating factor that the killing was committed in a heinous or depraved manner. However, the court found that that evidence could only be weighed once in evaluating whether the death penalty should be imposed. Therefore, the court found that there was only one substantial aggravating factor to be weighed against a substantial mitigating factor, the dramatic disparity in sentence between defendant's death sentence and co-defendant's four-year prison term, which the trial court failed to weigh. The court concluded that the sentence of death on the murder count should be reduced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

Recalling a recent sexual assault case in which the assailant fit defendant's description and wore a lei, the officer later relayed the information to his supervisor. Defendant was later arrested on a probation violation and ended up confessing to the sexual assault. A search warrant was issued, and the leis were seized. The trial court suppressed the leis and confession, and an appellate court affirmed, but remanded for consideration of the officer's &quot;good faith.&quot; On the parties' petition and cross-petition for review, the court vacated the court of appeals' memorandum, set aside the trial court's suppression order, and remanded.

Petitioners sought review of the impeachment proceedings by special action.

The court noted, however, that the charges preferred against the governor involved a serious abuse of official power and that such charges were generally considered to be impeachable.

The court granted review to consider whether the trial court erred in awarding attorneys' fees against defendant. The basis for the state's motion for attorneys' fees was Ariz. Rev.

The trial court neither set forth the evidence it considered nor found that it was clear and convincing. Because the trial court failed to make specific findings as required by Ariz. Rev.

The trial court denied defendant post-conviction relief and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant was not denied equal protection due to the fact that his co-defendant received a separate trial after the original trial and defendant did not. Their defenses were not mutually exclusive and the co-defendant was granted a severance because evidence properly elicited by defendant's attorney about his links to organized crime and other &quot;hits&quot; was so prejudicial that the co-defendant was entitled to a separate trial. The trial court properly applied the crime committed for pecuniary gain and especially heinous, cruel, or depraved aggravated circumstances during sentencing. The court refused to allow defendant to conduct an evidentiary hearing or deposition to inquire into the competency of the trial court judge, who underwent brain surgery two days after the trial and subsequently died, as defendant failed to present evidence showing he was incompetent.</SPAN></P>

The providers of the telephone information service also sought to intervene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the legislature passed Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2920, the Commission ordered the telephone company to block the telephone information service, which provided customers with access to a message network, and to propose a presubscription plan. The request for special action was granted because the dispute involved fundamental rights under Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 6, and the First Amendment. The providers' motion to intervene was granted because the Commission's presubscription requirement affected their economic interests and fundamental rights. Employing judicial restraint, the court focused on the state constitutional free speech issue. It held that the telephone company had third party standing to assert the providers' rights where it challenged an order as overbroad. The presubscription requirement violated the right to freely speak as guaranteed by Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 6, which was a right not subject to being balanced against the government's interests. Nor was the order a valid time, place, and manner restriction because it was not drawn with narrow specificity. Based on the foregoing, the court declared the order void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, and evidence of two prior convictions was submitted for purposes of sentencing. He was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment on the burglary conviction to run consecutively to a mandatory life sentence on the sexual assault conviction. He appealed the convictions and sentences. The court affirmed both. There was sufficient evidence to support the finding that he had two prior felony convictions. There was no error in the denial of defendant's request for a physical lineup especially in light of the fact that the assailant's identity was never really in issue. Defendant's decision not to testify waived any error with regard to the trial court's ruling to allow his prior convictions to be used for impeachment purposes. The omission of an instruction on the presumption of innocence did not constitute fundamental error. Because defendant attempted to flee before the officers addressed him, the warrantless entry into his home was justified as an exigent circumstance. The consecutive sentences did not constitute double punishment. Defendant was not denied equal protection of the law due to the enhanced sentence he received based on his probationary status.</SPAN></P>

P. 11 and that there was no abuse of discretion in denying continuances. The court further held that the state was not obligated to elect between premeditated and felony murder, that defendant's statements made during police interrogation were voluntary in that the police statements were not promissory in nature, and did not induce defendant to make a statement. The court also held that there were no errors in voir dire that would have required a mistrial, and that evidentiary rulings were properly made.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for murder in the first degree by the Superior Court of Pima County Arizona. That court allowed child witnesses to testify via videotape without a showing of particularized need as required under Az. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4251 et seq., and overruled defendant's objections regarding prosecutor's improper vouching for the honesty of its witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the prosecutor improperly vouched for his witnesses' credibility, and defendant's federal and state constitutional right to confront adverse witnesses was violated by the state's videotaped presentation of the testimony of his minor children. The court affirmed. The court held that because the prosecutor's arguments vouched for the honesty of its witness, the argument was absolutely improper. The court held that the test required courts to determine the likelihood that a jury was affected by the state's remarks. However, because vouching was neither an invited nor an acceptable response, and when the state resorted to vouching for the credibility of a witness, it seriously jeopardized the validity of the conviction that it sought. In addition, the court said that Az. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4251 et seq., was unconstitutionally applied, where the state was permitted to shield the children from face-to-face confrontational testimony without first making an individualized showing that either of them needed such protection, and without such a showing, the error required reversal as defendant's Sixth Amendment right was violated.</SPAN></P>

The action sought damages and injunctive relief due to alleged discrimination by the city in charging different water rates for customers residing outside its exterior boundaries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted an ordinance that doubled the water rates for those residing outside the geographical boundaries of the city. The court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court. The court reasoned that the nonresidents did not have a civil rights action against the city. The nonresidents had no constitutional right to receive water at a particular rate and their remedy was under state law. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-516 prohibited a city from discontinuing water services to nonresidents. The court held that the implication of reasonable rates for utility service must have been read into &sect; 9-516 and the city must provide water service at a reasonable rate. As a general rule, a municipally owned waterworks system that supplies water outside its corporate limits may have charged more for that service than it charges the users who resided within the corporate limits. Proof that service of nonresidents involved greater expenses was sufficient to show that a city acted reasonably in charging high rates for nonresidents. The enactment of the new statute,&nbsp;&sect; 9-511(A), only affected the nonresidents in their damage claim for the time after the effective date of the amendment.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the trial court erred in giving the instructions that it did. The court concluded that an insanity instruction materially misstated defendant's burden on the primary issue. The court held that the instruction went to the very heart and foundation of defendant's case, damaging that case on a matter essential to the defense and casting doubt on the integrity of the verdict. The trial court did not help the fundamental error problem or render it &quot;harmless&quot; by noting for the jury that the clear and convincing standard was a lesser burden of proof than the state's burden of proving all the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The correct instruction would have apprised the jury that the clear and convincing standard was an intermediate standard, between proof beyond a reasonable doubt and proof by a preponderance of the evidence, and that clear and convincing evidence was evidence that made the existence of the issue propounded &quot;highly probable.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of strangling then shooting his stepdaughter and possibly sexually assaulting the 11-year-old child first. The court reviewed the record for fundamental error pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4035 and found none. No Miranda warning was required when a paid informant questioned defendant while in prison on other charges because there was no objective indicia of arrest and the murder investigation was not yet focused on defendant. The confession to said informant should have been suppressed as coercive, for offering protection from other inmates, but such was harmless error because the confession to the informant's girlfriend was remote in time from the first and made after defendant's prison release and the girlfriend was not a state agent. The death sentence was properly imposed because the record revealed aggravating factors of cruelty from the form of the murder and depravity and heinousness from the confessed statements about defendant's feelings toward the victim. The terms cruel, heinous, and depraved are not vague rendering the death penalty statute unconstitutional. Defendant did not have a right to a voir dire examination of the trial judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child victim was under observation for signs of sexual abuse when she reported the alleged incident, and the record indicated that she had suffered prior sexual abuse at the hands of her father and others. The court found that defendant waived the issue of the child's unavailability to testify by failing to object at trial. However, the court concluded that the admission of the child's hearsay statements was fundamental error because her hearsay statements were inadmissible and there was no evidence without her statements to convict defendant. The court found that the child's statements to her mother, police, and her therapists were not admissible under some recognized or residual exception to the hearsay rule and there was inadequate corroborative evidence to bolster the reliability of her statements to satisfy the residual exception. The court found that the child's advanced knowledge of sexual matters could not be solely attributed to the alleged incident between her and the defendant, which negated the reliability that such knowledge ordinarily provided. Defendant's ambiguous response to the mother's accusation was insufficient to corroborate the child's statements.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the counseling sessions were a group activity and not treatment for defendant. After one session, the defendant told the doctor that he had suffocated the victim. The court found that under the facts, the defendant's statements to the doctor were not protected by the physician-patient privilege, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4062(4). The court found that the information was given while the doctor was not attending the defendant nor was the information necessary to enable the doctor to treat the defendant. Further, the court found that defendant's statements were made outside the counseling session. The court found no error in the denial of the defendant's motion in limine to exclude testimony and test results of the identification and grouping of dried blood stains because defendant was not denied the opportunity to impeach the state's expert or procedure, since defendant had an opportunity to independently analyze the samples and cross-examine the witness.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband and wife appealed from the judgment of the court of appeals (Arizona), which held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-569 was unconstitutional, but which affirmed the trial court's judgment for plaintiffs in their malpractice action against defendant doctor on the ground that the trial court's error in limiting plaintiffs' cross-examination of an expert witness in accordance with this statute was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the doctor's expert witnesses was a vice president of the malpractice insurer that had issued the doctor's malpractice policy. Basing his ruling on Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-569, which prohibited the introduction of evidence of malpractice insurance, the trial judge limited cross-examination of the expert witness to preclude any mention of the insurer. The court held that &sect; 12-569 was unconstitutional, but that the trial judge's error in limiting cross-examination was harmless. The Arizona Supreme Court had adopted the Arizona Rules of Evidence pursuant to its constitutional rulemaking power. These rules set the framework for determining what was relevant evidence. The separation of powers doctrine prohibited the legislature from defining what was relevant evidence. Here, the statute forbade the introduction of the evidence no matter how relevant or how nonprejudicial it might be. The court held that appellants in this case bore the burden of proving that the trial court's decision was prejudicial. Given the number of experts who testified for the defense, they failed to demonstrate that they were prejudiced by the error limiting cross-examination of one expert.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner injured consumer brought an action against defendant manufacturer and others for negligence, gross negligence, and strict products liability. The United States District Court for the District of Arizona certified a question of law to determine whether the Arizona statute of repose in a strict products liability case, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-551, violated Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consumer was injured while operating a cotton gin that was distributed for ultimate use or consumption more than 12 years before the action accrued. The manufacturer alleged an affirmative defense that the Arizona statute of repose was applicable to strict products liability cases. The federal court certified the question to determine the constitutionality of the statute. The court held the statute of repose was not an abrogation of a substantive right of action protected by Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 6 because the tort of strict products liability did not exist at the time the constitutional provision was adopted. Although a right of access to the courts was a &quot;fundamental&quot; right that, if infringed, demanded as justification a compelling state interest, the court held that the consumer was not denied access to the courts in the constitutional sense. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-551 satisfied the rational basis test and was constitutional under the equal protection and due process clauses of the Arizona Constitution. The classification created by the statute was reasonably related to the legislature's purpose in dealing with what was perceived in 1977 to be a products liability crisis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered &quot;no&quot; to the certified question and held that the Arizona statute of repose in a strict products liability case was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeals, Division One (Arizona), which reversed the trial court's order of dismissal of the charge against him for leading organized crime based on Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2308 being unconstitutionally vague. He argued that the pre-amendment &sect; 13-2308(A)(1) contained an insufficient scienter requirement and the definition of criminal syndicate was imprecise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with 13 counts, including one count of leading organized crime in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2308. The trial court concluded that prior to its 1985 amendment, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2308 was unconstitutionally vague and granted his motion to dismiss on that basis. The appellate court reversed. The court affirmed. Nowhere did defendant claim that his potentially innocent conduct was being prosecuted, so he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. But the court found that even if he had standing, there was no merit in the substance of his constitutional challenge.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2301(C)(2), defining &quot;criminal syndicate,&quot; was sufficiently precise as to avoid criminalizing entirely innocent behavior.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2308(A)(1), prior to its amendment in 1985, was not unconstitutionally vague for lack of a scienter requirement. The court found that the pre-amendment statute did, in fact, contain an implied scienter requirement as mandated by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-202(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate decision reversing the trial court's dismissal of one count against the defendant was affirmed as supplemented. Defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. Even if he had standing, there was no merit in his constitutional challenge. Neither the pre-amendment statute nor the definition of criminal syndicate was unconstitutionally vague. The matter was remanded to the superior court.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 27-234(B) was void and seeking special action relief. The trial court granted summary judgment to respondent, and the court reversed and remanded the case. The court held that the fixed royalty provisions of &sect; 27-234(B) that permitted respondent to lease minerals on a flat rate royalty violated the appraisal and true value provisions of the Arizona Enabling Act (act) and the comparable provisions of the state constitution. The court held that the amendments to the act did not permit the state to deal with mineral deposits on school trust lands in an unrestricted manner and did not withdraw the stringent dispositional requirements. The court found that the Jones Act was intended to prohibit the sale of mineral deposits, while still allowing their leasing on a royalty basis for terms of five years or less. The court held that the Enabling Act and Ariz. Const. art. 10 forbade the state from making nonhydrocarbon mineral leases without appraisal or for less than their true value and that &sect; 27-234 was unconstitutional and void as to such leases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot an elderly man to death when the man entered his neighbor's house, which defendant was burglarizing. Defendant represented himself at trial and was convicted and sentenced to death. The court affirmed. There was no error in the pre-trial identification of defendant because, although the circumstances surrounding the identification created a substantial likelihood of misidentification, there was no state involvement where defendant insisted on the face-to-face encounter. Defendant was properly denied mental examinations because there was nothing to suggest that he was insane when he killed the victim or that he was incompetent to stand trial. The aggravating favor of murder for pecuniary gain was supported because no other explanation for the killing existed other than the victim's discovery of a burglary in progress. The trial court properly considered defendant's mitigating and aggravating factors, and the capital sentence was not improper. The court had already rejected each of defendant's death penalty constitutional arguments in earlier decisions. Finally, the death penalty was proportional to the crime, given defendant's two prior murder convictions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Fourth Amendment did not apply to prison cells.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sentenced defendant to aggravated concurrent terms of 21 years for attempted second degree murder and 15 years for aggravated assault. On appeal, he contested neither the assault conviction and sentence nor the attempted second degree murder conviction. Defendant challenged his attempted second degree murder sentence asserting that his term constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. He claimed the penalty was disproportionate to Arizona's maximum sentence of 20 years for completed second degree murder under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-710. The court of appeals held that any part of defendant's sentence for attempted second degree murder that exceeded the maximum 20 years for second degree murder was unconstitutional, and remanded for resentencing to a term less than 20 years. The court held that the sentence did not fail the proportionality test because the second degree murder statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1001(C)(1) carried a heavier penalty than that for attempted second degree murder. Unlike a conviction for second degree murder, defendant had the possibilities of commutation of sentence, pardon, parole, and earned release credits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff survivors brought wrongful death actions against defendant healthcare providers alleging medical malpractice. In both cases, the trial court awarded summary judgment and the appellate court affirmed the judgment awards. The court consolidated the appeals and reversed the decisions except for an ancillary complaint against one defendant hospital. The court first held that the malpractice statute, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-564, with its three-year statute of limitations, encompassed death as well as injury, finding no legislative intent for the statute to apply only to injury. The court also found that the generic statute of limitations excepted out &sect; 12-564, so that the generic wrongful death statute, with its two-year statute of limitations did not apply to a medical malpractice suit. Next, the court held that the accrual period began to run at the time of death, citing California and Nevada judicial interpretations of similarly constructed medical malpractice statutes. Thus, the wrongful death actions accrued on the date of the death of their decedents, giving petitioners three years from that date within which to file their actions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant refused to submit to the chemical breath test, and testimony as to his refusal was admitted into evidence. The court reversed the appellate decision that had found the admission of the evidence of refusal to be erroneous. The court held that Ariz. Const. art. 6, &sect; 5(5) granted to the Arizona Supreme Court the power to make rules relative to all procedural matters in any court. Hence, the statute allowing admission in a criminal trial of evidence regarding an accused's refusal to take a breath test, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692(K), exceeded the legislature's power. The court found no constitutional error in the trial court's admission of such evidence, however. The court held that refusal to take a chemical breath test was not testimonial evidence but physical evidence only; therefore, it did not violate an accused's self-incrimination rights and was admissible at a criminal trial for driving under the influence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of seven counts armed robbery and one count aggravated assault. Defendant was sentenced under the enhancement provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604.02(A). Defendant sought review, contending that the statute was unconstitutional unless interpreted to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt and trial to a jury, rather than a judge, to determine release status. The court affirmed and found that the trial court determined that defendant was on release from confinement when he committed the offenses. Although the court noted that it had no definite tests to apply in resolving the federal constitutional issue, it was able to conclude from caselaw that there was no requirement to find that release status was a separate element of a separate crime. The court held that release status was a sentence-enhancing factor which may have been found by the judge and need not have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The court, having reviewed the record for fundamental error pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4035, found no fundamental error.</SPAN></P>

The court found that an instruction was improper because a reasonable juror could perceive that the burden of proof for the element of malice shifted from the state to defendant. However, the court found that the erroneous malice instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, where the jury found defendant was sane at the time of the murders and both malice and defendant's guilt were overwhelmingly supported by the evidence.

The municipal court denied the motion. At trial, the prosecutor elicited testimony from the arresting officer that defendant had asked for and received the sample. Later, defendant took the witness stand, and over defense objections, was asked during cross-examination whether he had received the breath sample. The superior court judge ruled that it was reversible error for the prosecutor to refer to the fact that defendant had sought and obtained a breath sample because defendant did not introduce evidence relating to the sample. The court vacated the reversal, holding that the prosecutor did not err in presenting evidence that defendant was given a breath sample or in commenting on his failure to produce evidence concerning the results. In taking the stand, defendant voluntarily subjected himself to the prosecutor's questions, and defendant had challenged the validity of the state's blood alcohol test results during the trial.</SPAN></P>

On review, defendant challenged the circumstances of his arrest and the allegedly excessive sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of seven felony counts relating to abduction and rape, all offenses committed while he was on parole from prior convictions. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment and consecutive sentences. On appeal, defendant first alleged that the officer who arrested him did not have probable cause to do so. The court found that the officer had a detailed description of the crime and of defendant from the victim. This gave the officer sufficient information to believe that a crime was convicted and that defendant committed it. Defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were not compromised by the arrest. The court also rejected defendant's arguments that pretrial identification procedures, involving the victim's viewing a photographic lineup and observing defendant near the scene of the crime, were suggestive. The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's allowing testimony of an expert witness, a tracker, regarding shoe prints found close to where the victim was assaulted. The court held that the sentences were proper under the aggravating circumstances of the crimes and the improbability of defendant's rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

Unaware of the woman, defendant switched lanes to pass. He hit the woman, who suffered multiple injuries including a broken pelvis. Defendant panicked after hitting the woman and did not stop at the accident scene, but someone recorded his license number and gave it to the police. Defendant ultimately pled guilty to leaving the scene of an accident involving personal injury. He was placed on three years' probation and ordered to pay restitution to the victim. The appellate court affirmed, but the court vacated the judgment and remanded. The court concluded that defendant thoroughly understood the consequences of his agreement to pay restitution only if the record contained either a statement in the plea agreement setting forth a specific dollar amount, or a statement by defendant indicating agreement to pay a specific dollar amount, or a warning by the trial judge prior to accepting defendant's plea that he could order a specific dollar amount.

One of the brothers, not the defendant appealing, confessed that he alone stabbed and killed the bank manager.

The brothers and the state all stipulated to the voluntariness of the confession, but when defendant sought to have it admitted under Ariz. R. Evid. 804(b)(3), the state opposed and the statements were excluded as untrustworthy hearsay. The issues raised by defendant on appeal included the trial court's refusal to admit the brother's confession into evidence and the refusal to give a lesser included offense instruction regarding felony murder. The court found that the trial court did not limit its review of factors suggesting trustworthiness or lack thereof under Rule 804(b)(3) to evidence corroborating and contradicting the brother's statements. After reviewing such evidence, the court concluded that a reasonable person could not have found that the exculpatory statements were true.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper published a conspicuous retraction after learning the original story was false. The trial judge instructed the jury that if the newspaper's retraction met the requirements of &sect;&sect; 12.653.02 and 12.653.03, the jury could not have awarded general damages, which therefore precluded damages for loss of reputation and for emotional distress, which the defamed persons sought. Ariz. Const. art. 18, &sect; 6 provided a right of action to recover damages for injuries that could never have been abrogated. The court concluded that &sect; 6 was a strong open court provision that constitutionalized the right to access to the courts and a remedy for damages sustained, and protected the right to recover damages for injury to reputation. Section 6 was also not static, but evolved with the development of the common-law, and so also protected the right to seek recovery for emotional distress. The court found the retraction statutes violated &sect; 6 because the statutes sought to abrogate recovery of damages for actual injury to reputation and for emotional suffering by completely depriving the defamed persons of a judicial remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the department's valuations as calculated under Ariz. Rev.

The court found that the legislature intended the statutory formula in &sect; 42-124.01 to be the exclusive method to calculate full cash value of electric and gas utilities. Because identical tax rates have been applied uniformly to both investor-owned and cooperative utility property, tax assessment discrepancies among utilities resulting from discretionary depreciation practices permitted by law did not violate Ariz. Const. art. 9, &sect; 1 uniformity requirements. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-136(A)(2)(b) created two property classifications, one for electric and gas utilities and one for water and gas pipeline utilities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual conduct with a minor under 15, kidnapping, and first-degree murder and was sentenced to death for first-degree murder. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not err in failing to suppress defendant's out-of-court statements, because defendant's right to cut off questioning was honored, his Miranda rights were readvised, and any coercion by the police was harmless. The court ruled that the trial court did not err in failing to suppress the out-of-court and in-court identifications of defendant, because the photographic lineups were not unduly suggestive nor publicly tainted. The court found that the search of defendant's business was valid, that the evidence submitted of a prior bad act was proper, and that the photographs of the victim and crime scene were not prejudicial. The court held that the trial court properly allowed defendant's admission of his prior convictions, that the circumstances of the murder indicated that the death penalty was properly imposed and that defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective.</SPAN></P>

The superior court also found that defendant was no longer a danger to herself or society. The court denied the special relief sought by the State, agreeing with the superior court that &sect; 13-3994(D) was unconstitutional. Because &sect; 13-3994(D) absolutely denied persons acquitted by reason of insanity the possibility of a release hearing to determine recovered sanity before 230 days had passed, the court held that &sect; 13-3994(D) denied such persons due process of law. The court found that &sect; 13-3994(D) contained no provision flexible enough to allow for evaluation or recovery before 230 days had elapsed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the shovel was sold, the manufacturer modified the design to make the conductors less accessible. The worker and wife argued on appeal that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-686(2), limiting the use of design modification evidence, unconstitutionally infringed judicial rulemaking powers, or that &sect; 12-686(2) was inapplicable. The manufacturer contended that the trial court erred either in admitting the evidence or in refusing a requested limiting instruction. The court held that &sect; 12-686(2) was to be interpreted as forbidding, in a product liability action, the use of evidence of post-sale, pre-injury modification to prove a &quot;defect&quot; resulting from either negligent conduct or defective product quality, and that so interpreted, it was constitutional. The court determined that evidence of change to prove unreasonable danger was limited by both &sect; 12-686(2) and Ariz. R. Evid. 407, but that the evidence could have been admitted for a number of other purposes. The court concluded that the refusal of the request for a limiting instruction was prejudicial error, because the lack of limiting instructions allowed the jury to use the evidence as an admission of defect or proof of negligent design.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the opinion of the court of appeals, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for a new trial and proceedings not inconsistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

After his father fired him, defendant shot and killed his father. Defendant claimed he was insane at the time of the crime. The order that convicted defendant of murder and burglary was affirmed. The court held that defendant's motion for mistrial was properly denied because the time the jury had spent in deliberations was not unreasonably long, a significant number of jurors had indicated that progress could be made on the burglary count, and a return of the jury for another day of deliberations did not work a hardship on any juror. The trial court erred in unilaterally modifying a supplemental jury instruction that had been agreed to by the parties. However, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because there was no proof that the modified supplemental instruction prejudiced defendant. Finally, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-502(B), which required defendant to prove with clear and convincing evidence that he was insane at the time of the crime, was constitutional. Because the burden of proof was a substantive matter, the legislature could have properly changed the burden of proof on the insanity defense.</SPAN></P>

The court approved the vacation of the transfer order because Ariz. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's contention that it was error to introduce evidence that defendant was someone other than Rick Watson. The court held that because defendant's identity was an issue, the trial court properly denied the motion to preclude mention of defendant's alias. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in not declaring a mistrial after a witness mentioned finding marijuana on defendant, where the trial court had previously held that the marijuana evidence was inadmissible. The court held that although it was error for the marijuana to have been mentioned, the error did not materially influence the jury and did not merit mistrial or reversal. The court modified one of the death sentences to a sentence of life imprisonment, holding that findings that defendant killed, attempted to kill, or intended to kill one of the three victims was unsupported by the evidence. The court affirmed the other convictions and remaining sentences, holding that a total disregard for human life was clearly shown in the record and the only reasonably ascertainable motive for the murders was to cold-bloodedly eliminate any and all witness to a robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, and first degree burglary. The court modified the sentence from death to life imprisonment for one count of the three counts of first degree murder, but affirmed the remaining sentences.</SPAN></P>

Defendant later obtained the victim's telephone number and began calling her, asking to come over. One night, the victim told defendant that he could not visit due to the late hour. The victim was talking with a neighbor when defendant knocked on her door. The victim let him in. When the neighbor left, defendant forced the victim to engage in different sex acts. Defendant held a knife to the victim's throat and repeatedly slapped her in the face. Defendant was subsequently arrested and questioned by a detective. Defendant admitted to committing some of the sex acts, but maintained that the relations were consensual. A jury convicted defendant of four counts of sexual assault. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment on one count. The trial court ordered that the sentences for the other counts be served concurrently with each other but consecutively to the first count. The court affirmed on appeal, holding that defendant was advised of his Miranda rights and his statements made to the detective were voluntary.

The court granted review to examine whether Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee tendered back his worker's compensation award and filed a tort action against the employer, a coemployee, and others. The employee attempted to withdraw his worker's compensation claim. The administrative law judge found that the employee had waived his tort remedy because he understood that he was accepting compensation. The appellate court affirmed the ALJ's decision. The appellate court also held that a waiver of the employee's common law tort remedies occurred even if the employee did not know of his alternative remedies or the consequences of his acceptance. The court granted review, approved the appellate court's decision, and affirmed the award. The court held that the intentional acceptance of compensation benefits was a statutory waiver of the employee's common law tort remedy against the employer. The waiver was effected by the act of accepting compensation because &sect; 23-1024(A) stated that such acceptance was a waiver of common law remedies. The court found that the statutory waiver was permissible in the employee's case because the provisions of Ariz.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery, dangerous nature. Based upon a finding by the jury that defendant was on probation at the time of the robbery, the judge imposed an enhanced sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release pursuant to Ariz.

The court further held that the decision by the trial judge to admit the tape-recorded confession to rebut proposed testimony by defendant that his confession was coerced and untruthful did not violate Ariz. R. Evid. 403, nor did it unconstitutionally hamper defendant's right to testify at trial. The court held that a contested jury instruction adequately served defendant's interest in presenting his defense, and was not so confusing as to warrant a reversal. The court set aside the sentence because the prior crime for which defendant had been on probation had not been designated a felony, and the enhancement provisions of Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. The court found that defendant's arrest was supported by probable cause where he matched the description of an attempted burglar in the sparsely populated area. The court held that 20 months between the grant of a new trial and the order for new trial did not constitute inexcusable delay where the state was justified in exercising its right to appeal, and defendant was not prejudiced from the period of incarceration and the absence of a witness whose testimony was read to the jury. The court reversed the conviction on grounds that defendant was entitled to a jury instruction on lost evidence because the state failed to remove and preserve alleged blood spots from the victim's car and made affirmative comments that they were blood. The court found that the comments evidenced the spots' materiality and the state created prejudice by using them to contradict defendant's claim that he never saw the victim. On remand, the court instructed the trial court under Ariz. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was adjudged guilty of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and first degree burglary. The trial court sentenced defendant to death on the murder conviction, and terms of incarceration for the other convictions. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions, but vacated the death penalty. The court held that: (1) there was no abuse of discretion in denying defendant's request for a physical lineup seven months after the crime, and the photo lineup procedure was not suggestive; (2) defense counsel's performance was not deficient where the trial judge was fully apprised of the arguments in favor of mitigation; (3) the murder was committed in an especially cruel manner and in an especially heinous and depraved manner; and (4) the trial court did not understand the meaning and operation of the statutory scheme for finding the existence of mitigating circumstances and the evaluation and weighing of those circumstances. Because the trial judge used the wrong standard for determining and applying mitigating factors, the court vacated defendant's death sentence and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The court further found that as to defendant's sentence for armed robbery, because the jury's verdict necessarily included a finding of dangerousness, no error occurred in the court's sentencing of defendant to life imprisonment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the District of Arizona certified several questions of law concerning the proper interpretation of third party plaintiff securities dealer's complaint against third party defendant law firm, alleging violations of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act (UCATA), Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-2501 to 12-2509 (1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The securities dealer served as a selling agent for limited partnerships, and the law firm served as counsel for the limited partnerships. The limited partnerships filed an action against the securities dealer and the law firm in the district court under various federal securities laws and pendent state claims. The securities dealer filed a third party claim against the law firm and amended it to include the newly enacted UCATA. The district court certified questions of law to this court. The court held that the statutory scheme of the UCATA revealed the meaning of &quot;actions&quot; in &sect; 3 as pertaining to only the underlying tort action. The court held that no contribution action could occur following the trial of a tort action unless the trier of fact had determined the relative degrees of fault of all the parties. Thus, if the tort action was tried under pre-UCATA law, no comparative fault finding could be made, and no contribution action was possible. Further, unless the tort action was filed on or after UCATA's effective date, UCATA would not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that &quot;actions&quot;, as used in a newly enacted statute, meant underlying tort actions and that joint tortfeasors could not make the law applicable to their actions by amending their contribution claims to after the effective date. The act created a separate and distinct cause of action for contribution that did not accrue until after one of several joint tortfeasors had paid more than its share of the common liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which convicted him of murder, theft of property, and fraudulent schemes. Among nine errors raised, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3905 under which he was made to appear in a live lineup and he argued that it was error to refuse to sever the homicide count from those relating to charges of using the victim's credit card.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted of murder, theft of property, and fraudulent schemes, challenged his conviction on the grounds that the statute authorizing his detention was unconstitutional. The victim, a real estate agent, was killed after meeting with a telephone caller who claimed to have land for sale. The body was found after another real estate agent informed police of a similar attempt to lure him to view some land by a man matching defendant's description. Pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3905, defendant was shaved and made to appear in a live lineup. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion to sever the trial of the murder and robbery charges from those charging fraud and theft. He also challenged various other rulings during voir dire and during his trial. Finding no error in the lower court's rulings, the appellate court affirmed the convictions because the challenged statute allowed for detention for no longer than three hours in order to obtain certain judicially authorized types of evidence. The appellate court also held that joinder of offenses was proper because all the crimes charged were part of a continuing series of events.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for murder, theft of property, and fraudulent schemes because the challenged statute satisfied the Fourth Amendment's litmus test of reasonableness. The court held that the offenses were properly joined and that a fair determination of defendant's guilt or innocence was not jeopardized by the lower court's refusal to sever.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first degree murder and other criminal offenses and was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed, alleging that the state engaged in continuous misconduct and that he was denied a fair trial. The alleged misconduct involved nondisclosure of evidence and misconduct exclusive of nondisclosure of evidence, including the state's comment regarding pretrial identification in its opening argument and improper trial publicity. The court held that while the state's conduct was improper, there was no evidence that defendant had been prejudiced because the trial court instructed the jury to disregard the statement and because the trial judge questioned all the jurors regarding the article. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the death penalty was unconstitutional because the jury took no part in the sentencing determination and because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703 gave the trial court no guidance as to what the mitigating factors were and how to weigh them against aggravating circumstances. The court affirmed, holding that pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4035, it had examined the entire record for fundamental error and found none.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for his participation in contract murders. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by requiring that defendant be shackled during the trial because of the nature of the crimes and the fact that extensive precautions were taken to assure the jury would not see the restraints. The line-up in which defendant was identified by the witness was not unduly suggestive because there was nothing to single out defendant. Even if it was unduly suggestive, the identification was admissible because although it was unduly suggestive because the witness had the opportunity to see defendant, she was at a high level of attention, and she had a high level of certainty at trial. The trial court properly limited expert testimony as to the identification of defendant because the court chose not to apply a new rule allowing such testimony retroactively. Additional safeguards were present at trial to minimize the possibility of a miscarriage of justice. Defendant was not allowed to withdraw his waiver of a right to a jury trial on his prior convictions because the waiver was voluntary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant filed a petition for review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals, Division One (Arizona), which affirmed the administrative law judge's (ALJ) determination. The ALJ had ruled in favor of respondents, industrial commission, employer, and insurance carrier, and had denied all compensation to the claimant under the Arizona Workers' Compensation Act (Act), Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-901 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing on the claimant's request for benefits, the ALJ denied all compensation. Although the claimant had sought benefits under the Act's general provisions, the ALJ held that the claim had to be considered under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 23-901(12)(c), 23-901.01, the occupational disease provisions. The ALJ determined that the testimony did not establish the six compensability requirements of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-901.01. The court of appeals affirmed the determination. On appeal, the court vacated the judgment of the court of appeals insofar as it held that mere aggravation of a pre-existing disease was not compensable in an occupational disease setting. The court otherwise affirmed the judgment because it was within the ALJ's prerogative to deem the testimony of the doctor who consulted on the claimant's condition more credible than the testimony of the claimant's physician. The consulting doctor stated that he did not believe work exposure had aggravated the claimant's condition as compared to simply triggering symptomatology. Thus, the ALJ's finding that the claimant did not prove a connection between work exposure and his condition was supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated to the extent that it held that mere aggravation of a pre-existing disease was not compensable in an occupational disease setting.
