</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction was based upon a movie that defendant exhibited in a local movie theater. On review the court found that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-2101(b) provided that material was obscene if, considered as a whole, applying community standards, its predominant appeal was to prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and utterly without redeeming social value and if, in addition, it went substantially beyond customary limits of candor in describing or representing such matters. Defendant argued that the accusation was defective because it failed to include the definition of obscene materials as defined in &sect; 26-2101(b), but the court held that a statute could have provided criminal punishment without the definition of obscenity being included within that specific code section. The court held that the chapter in which Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-2105 was included, amply defined obscenity, and sections of the code that relate to the same subject matter had to be construed together.</SPAN></P>

Laws 152, Ga. Code Ann. ch. 69-6, authorized the county to enter into contracts so as to provide recreational facilities within the county, (2) the easement contract was authorized, and (3) the contract provided that the county had agreed to indemnify the power company for any damages arising from the use of the easement by the county. The court held that the complaint set forth a cause of action against the county based upon the contract that was valid and for that reason, the judgment of the superior court overruling the motions of the county to dismiss the complaint and cross-complaint were properly overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant license applicant, an oil company, asserting that an ordinance of appellee, the City of Carrollton, Georgia, was unreasonable, unconstitutional, and contrary to Georgia law and that the city was estopped, sought mandamus to compel the city to issue to it a license to operate a self-service motor fuel station within the city limits. After a hearing, the Carroll Superior Court (Georgia) denied the relief sought. The applicant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The controversy involved an abandoned service station which the applicant purchased and was renovating for the purpose of operating a self-service station. The city had adopted an ordinance which stated that it was unlawful for anyone other than the owner of a service station, manager, operator, or his agent to dispense motor fuel to the general public in the city limits. The trial court denied the applicant's challenge to the ordinance. On appeal, the court held that even if it should declare the city's ordinance invalid for any reason, such a declaration would not entitle the applicant to the relief sought, for there was nothing in the state law requiring the city to give further consideration to the matter and issue a license for said operation. Moreover, the court did not consider the city ordinance invalid for any reason argued and insisted upon. At the time enacted it represented a legitimate exercise of the police power of the city. It also represented a determination consonant with the &quot;local option&quot; policy adopted by the state under the &quot;local option&quot; law, 1971 Ga. Laws 683, 684 9 (codified at Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 23-2713, 23-2714), which became effective three weeks later.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The association and the homeowners owned homes in the area that were affected by the attempted rezonings. The individuals had requested the rezoning of the tracts in question to allow construction of a shopping center and other projects. A hearing on this issue was held and from 1,200 to 1,500 people were present, although the hearing was held in a room that only accommodated 50 people. The people who were interested in the various petitions could not get close to the door of the hearing room. The association and homeowners introduced unrebutted lay and expert evidence that such construction would be harmful to the area, causing dangerous traffic conditions, inadequate water and sewage, overcrowded schools, and other land use problems. The trial court later partially granted the association and homeowner's action for temporary injunction to stop the rezoning. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting a temporary injunction until a final trial to determine whether a &quot;public hearing&quot; had been held because the evidence suggested that the public did not have a sufficient opportunity to be heard at the rezoning hearing.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 26-2610(b). Prior to the trial defendant attacked the constitutionality of this statute. The trial court held that the statute was constitutional. The jury found that defendant was guilty and he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. He filed an amended motion for new trial, which was overruled. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-2610(b) was unconstitutional in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitutions of the United States and Georgia. Defendant argued that &quot;obscene and vulgar or profane language&quot; was too vague, indefinite and overbroad to give notice of the prohibited conduct. The statute punished unprovoked obscene, vulgar or profane language used in the presence of a female or a male under 14 years of age. The court held that the statute was constitutional because language was obscene, vulgar or profane when, under the circumstances and manner in which such utterance was made, it would clearly offend a reasonable person's sense of decency. The jury was authorized to find from the evidence that an 11-year-old girl was asked by defendant &quot;Have you ever been laid before?&quot; Defendant argued that the girl did not understand the meaning of the words and therefore no crime was committed. The girl testified that she knew its meaning because her mother had told her but that she did not &quot;want to say it.&quot; The court held that the jury was authorized to find from her testimony that she knew the meaning of the words spoken to her.</SPAN></P>

In 1965 the property was sold by the grantee under a power of sale provided for by such deed.  Lee purchased the property at such public sale as the terms of the deed to secure debt permitted him to do.  In 1970 a complaint in equity was filed seeking to set such deed aside.  The complaint, as amended, was brought in numerous counts and Count 5 of the amended complaint attacked the constitutionality of section 2 of the Act of 1935 (Ga.

The trial court denied the grantor's successor's motion for summary judgment, filed on the ground that &sect; 67-1506 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Section 67-1506 provided that no sale of real estate under a debt or deed was valid unless the sale was advertised and conducted at the time and place and in the usual manner of sheriff's sales in the county in which such real estate was located. The grantor's successor contended that &sect; 67-1506 deprived the grantor of due process. The court held that even if &sect; 67-1506 were unconstitutional, the terms of the deed would have to be against public policy for the deed to be set aside because the grantee followed the terms therein in making the sale. The deed did not allow the grantee to sell the property without following certain steps calculated to notify the grantor of the sale. Thus, it was not void as against public policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant former inmate was convicted of the unlawful possession of marijuana. During the pendency of the appeal, the former inmate was paroled and was serving the balance of his sentence on parole. The Superior Court of Macon County (Georgia) denied the habeas corpus application filed by the former inmate attacking his conviction because the evidence was procured in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Atlanta law enforcement officers received information from a law enforcement officer in California that a package believed to contain marijuana had been shipped to the airport. No other information concerning the informer, his reliability, or corroborating circumstances on the tip appeared in the record. The Atlanta officers went to the airport and waited for the package to arrive. When it arrived, they examined its contents and determined that it contained marijuana. They waited for someone to call for the package. The former inmate signed for the package, took it to his car, and he was arrested. At trial, the package was introduced into evidence. The former inmate did not move to suppress the evidence or object to its introduction. The inmate's conviction was affirmed on appeal. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that there was no evidence of probable cause to arrest the former inmate and that the seizure was illegal. However, because the trial court had not ruled on that issue, the court remanded the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on whether there was probable cause for the arrest and the search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the habeas corpus judgment and directed the habeas corpus court to enter an order allowing the State to try to show that there was an adequate constitutional basis for the search. If the State's attempt was successful, then the judgment of conviction could stand. If the State was unsuccessful, then the judgment of conviction was constitutionally erroneous and had to be set aside.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers timely filed tax returns declaring their intangible property subject to taxation at the fair market value. The tax assessors adjusted the taxpayers' valuations and assessed each parcel of real property and all tangible personal property at 40 percent of the fair market value. The trial courts enjoined the tax assessors from proceeding with any assessment against the taxpayers. On appeal, the court affirmed and affirmed in part and reversed. The court concluded that in all counties of the state all tangible property, both real and personal, except automobiles and trailers, constituted a single class of property for the purposes of taxation, and had to be assessed and taxed alike. The General Assembly had no authority to establish different classes or sub-classes of tangible property other than as fixed by Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; I. The orders complained of were void and illegal because they did not follow the mandate of the Acts nor of the constitutional provisions under which they purportedly were issued, and insofar as the trial court's judgments enjoined the enforcement of the orders of the revenue commissioner they were proper.</SPAN></P>

The insurer, which had received a properly executed proof of loss and release from appellants for payment, alleged that it was a mere stakeholder with respect to the policy proceeds and asked the trial court to grant an order directing to whom such proceeds should be paid. The trial court initially ordered the insurer to pay the proceeds into the registry of the court and, after a second hearing, ordered that such proceeds in the registry be paid to appellee in the amount of his lien. On review, appellants asserted that they were entitled to a trial by jury, that they had neither expressly nor impliedly waived that constitutional right, and that the trial judge's entry of final judgment was therefore improper.

The company placed its signs too close to the highway under the requirements of the Act of 1971. The company alleged that the Act of 1971, specifically &sect;&sect; 3 and 18 codified at Ga.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action for damages, plaintiff appealed a decision of the Clark State Court (Georgia), which granted defendant union's motion for a directed verdict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff brought an action for damages, basing jurisdiction on Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3-118, 3-119, 3-120, 3-121 because defendant agent was the business representative of the union and did business in the county where the suit was filed. Special pleas to the jurisdiction were filed by both the union and the agent, and the union filed another motion to dismiss, alleging that the venue statute, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 3-120, was unconstitutional. The motion to dismiss was overruled. The union filed a motion for directed verdict, which was granted by the trial court, and plaintiff appealed. The union cross-appealed the denial of its motion based on the venue statute. The court held that the purpose of the statute at issue was to avoid having to locate a group of individuals in order to file suit in the county where each resided. Therefore, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 3-120 was not unconstitutional for the reasons urged, and the trial court did not err in overruling the motion to dismiss. The court held that it was error for the trial court to find as a matter of law that the union was not doing business in the county when it had an agent and employees there. Thus, there was a question of fact as to venue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the denial of the union's motion to dismiss and reversed the trial court's grant of a directed verdict in favor of the union based on jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant filed demurrers to two indictments, which charged the defendant of theft by taking, contending that the statute prohibiting theft by taking, Ga.

Code Ann. &sect; 26-1802. The defendant appealed, contending that &sect; 26-1802 was violative of the defendant's right to due process because it was so vague, uncertain, and indefinite that it failed to inform the defendant of the conduct proscribed. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the statute was sufficiently definite in its terms to reasonably inform one charged thereunder as to the conduct proscribed thereby, that the jury was authorized to find that the defendant embarked on a fraudulent scheme of use of letterheads purporting to be those of a legitimate business concern, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order separate trials as to the two indictments. The crimes were similar in nature, and the scheme which resulted in their consummation was substantially identical in each case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant specially pled insanity. The jury found that he was not insane. Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of Muscogee County (Georgia) of eight capital felonies including murder and he was sentenced to death. In one case, defendant appealed his conviction and sentence. In the other case, the court granted a writ of certiorari to consider the reversal of the judgment in the sanity trial by the Court of Appeals of Georgia.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury determined that defendant was mentally competent to stand trial, so the trial court conducted the criminal trial and refused to admit certain documents into evidence about defendant's mental condition in 1967. The documents contained findings by two doctors that defendant was suffering from a mental disorder. The trial court found that the documents were not relevant to defendant's mental condition at the time of his criminal trial. The jury convicted defendant and the trial court sentenced him to death. Defendant appealed the sanity trial portion of his case. The Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia accepted the case. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the Court of Appeals committed error in accepting the appeal without a certificate of immediate review, therefore, it had to reverse that decision; (2) the exclusion of the documents on defendant's mental condition was not error, and even if it was error, it was harmless; (3) even if defendant was mentally deficient in some respects, he was a danger to society and his confinement was proper; and (4) the death penalty had been declared unconstitutional, so defendant had to serve life in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision of the court of appeals. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but it vacated the death penalty sentence and remanded the case with directions for the trial court to substitute a life sentence in its place.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Tattnall County (Georgia), which denied him relief under his postconviction petition for habeas corpus relief after he was convicted of rape and sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim identified defendant at a line-up, which occurred the day after the crime and before the indictment was returned. The victim later identified defendant at trial as the man who raped her. Defendant argued that he had been denied the assistance of counsel at the line-up. The trial court found that the in-court identification of defendant was sufficiently independent of the line-up so that, even if the line-up were defective, the positive identification at trial did not deprive defendant of his constitutional rights of due process and equal protection. On appeal, defendant challenged the death sentence and the composition of the jury. On review, the court affirmed the denial of the habeas corpus relief, but it ordered the sentence vacated and remanded the case to the sentencing court for it to impose a life sentence because Georgia's death penalty procedures had been declared unconstitutional; therefore, defendant could only be sentenced to life in prison. The court also held that: (1) the right to counsel attached only after the onset of formal prosecutorial proceedings; and (2) defendant did not show racial bias with respect to the grand jury or the traverse jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the habeas corpus court with directions for it to vacate the death sentence and remand the case to the trial court. The trial court was to sentence defendant to prison for life, which was the only lawful sentence which was permitted by law. Defendant did not have to be present in open court or represented by counsel, but he and his counsel had to be served with a copy of the sentence of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not continuing the case in order for defendant to find an absent witness because defendant did not show the materiality of the testimony which he expected to procure from the witness; (2) there was no evidence that the jury had been biased due to pretrial publicity or that the State had used peremptory challenges to strike black men from the jury; (3) the evidence was sufficient to charge the jury on a theory of conspiracy; and (4) sufficient evidence sustained the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for theft by conversion as defined in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-1808(a). The trial court overruled defendant's demurrer, which alleged that the application of the state statute constituted imprisonment for debt, involuntary servitude, and deprivation of liberty without due process of law in violation of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. XXI. On review, the court affirmed. The court stated the case and the application of the statute to defendant's acts was distinguishable from common law in which there was an assumption of fraud implied for legal indebtedness for wages and services due. The court ruled the statute did not provide for an unconstitutional imprisonment for debt or peonage; instead, it created a form of larceny after trust.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landowner brought an action against defendant adjoining landowner to have a private right of way of necessity established pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 83-101 through 83-106.2 for his use over the property of the adjoining landowner. The Superior Court of Fulton County (Georgia) entered a judgment dismissing the complaint on the grounds that &sect;&sect; 83-101 through 83-106.2 were unconstitutional. The landowner appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The adjoining landowner filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that O.C.G.A. &sect; 83-106.1 was unconstitutional because it allowed the granting of a private right of way of necessity without first compensating the owner of the property burdened with the right of way. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that &sect; 83-106.1 was unconstitutional under Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; III, para. I, O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-301, because it allowed for the granting of the right of way prior to the payment of just compensation. However, &sect; 83-106.1 was severable because it was not such an integral part of the statute that the entire statute must fall. Accordingly, the landowner could maintain his action under the remaining provisions of O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 83-101 through 83-106.2.</SPAN></P>

The father sought to vacate the trial court's judgment on the ground that he was deprived of procedural due process because he was not given notice of the name change. The court denied the father's request for vacation. First, the father did not have a property interest in maintaining his child's surname. The child's bearing of the father's surname was merely customary and could be changed for any purpose other than a fraudulent one. Second, the general assembly had the power to prescribe what notice was required prior to the trial court's acting on an application to change a name. The general assembly provided for notice by publication in accordance with Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 79-501. Finally, the court noted that although the father did not have a property right in having his child bear his surname, trial courts did take into account a father's &quot;protectible interest&quot; in such when it considered a proposed name change.</SPAN></P>

Affirming, the court held that defendant's demand for a list of witnesses was not specific in that it did not demand the names of witnesses who would testify at trial. A state crime lab employee was not named because the prosecutor did not know who the lab would send. Another witness was a rebuttal witness, whose name was not required to be furnished. Ga.

The purpose of the statute was to give an accused with no defense every opportunity to persuade the jury that the State failed to prove his guilt. This was a reasonable exception to the general rule.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This was a dispute between malt beverage dealers (dealers) and the county over an audit fee imposed by the county. The trial court held that the audit fee was a tax imposed for raising revenue.

However, the trial court did not err in enjoining further collection of the audit fee by the county. It noted that the 1958 constitutional amendment pursuant to Ga. La. 1958, pp. 582, 583, which authorized the levy of license taxes on businesses, was not self-executing. Therefore, the state statute under Ga. L. 1950, which limited a license fee to $ 100, controlled, with the result that the audit fee of $ 500 was invalid.</SPAN></P>

L. 1963, p. 2422, did not comply with the constitutional requirement that local or special bills could not be passed unless notice of the intention to apply therefore was published in the newspaper in which the sheriff's advertisements for the locality affected were published once a week for three weeks during a period of 60 days immediately preceding its introduction into the General Assembly. Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; 7, para. 15, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-1915. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the notice disclosed by the record was sufficient to meet this requirement. The court further held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 92-5304 provided that the tax commissioner was entitled to a 10 percent commission of all taxes collected in excess of 90 percent of the net tax digest, along with his salary.</SPAN></P>

The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the statute, but enjoined the wife from enforcing the order. The wife appealed. The husband cross appealed and moved to dismiss the appeal because it was not filed within 30 days as required by the Appellate Practice Act, &sect; 6-803(a). The wife did not file a brief or an enumeration of error. The court held that the 30-day limitation for filing an appeal was jurisdictional. Therefore, the court did not have jurisdiction over the appeal. In fact, it had previously been dismissed for want of prosecution. The court also held that it had no jurisdiction over the husband's cross appeal. Under &sect; 6-803(a), the jurisdiction of the court had to be properly invoked before a cross appeal could be perfected. Because the court was without jurisdiction over the wife's attempted appeal; it was also without jurisdiction over the husband's attempted cross appeal.

The trial court denied injunctive relief and granted defendants' motion to dismiss. The taxpayer appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. Ga. Const. art. XVII, &sect; I, paras. I-V, Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2-8601- 2-8605, was properly ratified because it should have been submitted only to the named city and counties for ratification as the provision did not directly effect the state as a whole. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the MARTA Act was unconstitutional as violative of Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; VII, para. VIII because all the provisions of the MARTA Act related to the subject matter of creating a rapid transit system and the title of the Act and its amendments put legislators on notice that the Act imposed a financing system. The sales and use tax levied under &sect; 25 of the MARTA Act was not unconstitutional because there was no requirement that the persons paying the taxes receive equal benefits from the facilities for which the taxes are used.</SPAN></P>

The inmate failed to show that any person with scruples against the death penalty was excluded from service on the jury. The jury was properly instructed because the principles of manslaughter were not involved in the evidence. Such a complaint could not have been raised in a habeas corpus proceeding. There was no election for a jury trial based upon unconstitutional coercion. The inmate, who was African American, urged that he was denied equal protection and due process of law because he was indicted by a grand jury and tried by a traverse jury which were drawn from a jury list that did not represent a fair cross-section of the community, contrary to O.C.G.A. &sect; 59-106 et seq., but the statistics presented by the testimony failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers' companion appeals contended that O.C.G.A. &sect; 92-1403(E)(1) (amended 1966) was unconstitutional because it contained matter not expressed in the title. Section 92-1403(E)(1) provided that in no case were the exemptions provided by the paragraph to have been allowed upon motor fuel used for the purpose of construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or repair of public highways. Although &sect; 92-1403(E)(1) (amended 1966) had the effect of eliminating a theretofore existing exemption, the court was unable to say that the provision was not germane to the provisions of the State Motor-Fuel Tax Law specifically referred to in the caption, which was notice that the particular section granting the exemption was being repealed and reenacted. The phrase, &quot;in order to clarify the legislative intent,&quot; in the caption considered with the fact that the statute had already been judicially construed, showed a clear intent to deal comprehensively with the subject matter prospectively. Thus, the court held that &sect; 92-1403(E)(1) (amended 1966) was constitutional and applicable to the taxpayers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a county and the chairman and members of the county board of commissioners, challenged a judgment by the DeKalb Superior Court (Georgia) holding 1956 Ga. Laws 2764 (Act) to be constitutional and granting mandamus absolute to defendants, officers and members of a county board of education and the county school superintendent. Plaintiffs had sought declaratory relief as to the parties' rights and responsibilities arising under the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act required the commissioners of roads and revenues to pay to the county board of education a set amount per month from funds derived from sources other than taxes. The county board of education passed a resolution directing the superintendent to demand payment of the sum from the commissioners. The commissioners refused to make the payment demanded, and plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court found the Act to be constitutional, dismissed plaintiff's prayer for summary judgment, and granted defendant's prayer for mandamus absolute. Reversing, the court held that the Act was unconstitutional and void as being in violation of Ga. Const. of 1945, art. VIII, &sect; XII, para. I, as amended. The court concluded that any fines, forfeitures, and license fees were required to be paid into the county treasury and deposited with the general funds derived from taxes. The funds thus became a part of the general operating funds of the county, which had to be applied only to those purposes for which the county had authority to spend tax moneys as provided by the Georgia Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants enacted an ordinance required respondent companies doing business in the unincorporated area of the county, and using rights of way owned, acquired, and maintained by the county, to obtain a license for such privilege. Electric and gas companies were required to pay a percentage of non-industrial gross revenue from sales in the area, and telephone companies were required to pay sums based on the number of telephones in service in the area. The ordinance also required a fee of $ 75 and $ .50 per square yard before any company could make any cut, excavation, or tunnel in, upon, under, or across any sidewalk, roadbed, street, pavement, or right of way in the area, in addition to restoring such area to its previous condition. The ordinance provided for fine and imprisonment for any person violating it. The trial court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional and issued an injunction enjoining respondent from enforcing it. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that because the ordinance did not regulate respondents, it was not a licensing ordinance, rather it was a taxing ordinance, which appellants had no constitutional or statuary authority to impose.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction. It held that 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2510 - 2518 did not violate U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State challenged a judgment from the State Court of Bibb County (Georgia) that granted habeas corpus absolute to defendant former inmate and ordered his discharge from custody. The trial court sustained the inmate's contentions that challenged the constitutionality of a city ordinance to which he pled guilty of violating, which prohibited the operation of a motor vehicle on the city's streets while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city passed the ordinance pursuant to 1955 Ga. Laws 736 et seq. (Act of 1955), which amended &sect; 47 of the Uniform Act Regulating Traffic on Highways in 1953 Ga. Laws &sect; 566 et seq. (Act of 1953). After the inmate pled guilty in the municipal court, he filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the trial court alleging that the Act of 1955 attempted to create the municipal court and to delegate to the city authority to operate a state court contrary to Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; I, para. I, O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-3601, and Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; IV, para. I, O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-401. The court held that neither the Act of 1955 nor the city ordinance enacted pursuant to the Act of 1955 were repugnant to the Constitution of the State of Georgia. Therefore, the trial court incorrectly held that the Act of 1955 and the city ordinance were unconstitutional and erred in discharging the inmate from custody. The court ruled that the city had a right to punish as a municipal offense conduct that was also an offense by general law of the State. The court determined that the city's right arose in part from the fact that the Act of 1955 was not a special act, but a general act of statewide application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retirees, who were former peace officers, sought an increase in retirement benefits, based on 1970 Ga. Laws 1153-1154, a constitutional amendment, which allowed the general assembly to appropriate funds to increase retirement benefits, after the completion of an individual's service. The board refused to pay the increased benefits on the grounds that the amendment was unconstitutional. The retirees brought an action for mandamus to compel the board to refigure their benefits. The trial court rendered judgment for the retirees and ordered the board to recompute their benefits. Appellants sought further review, and the court reversed. It explained that the words &quot;appropriates funds&quot; in the constitutional amendment meant the appropriation of funds from the state treasury. Thus, it concluded that the constitutional amendment did not apply to the retirement system for peace officers. Accordingly, it held that neither of the retirees was entitled to mandamus absolute to require a recomputation and increase of his retirement benefits in accordance with the constitutional amendment because the service of each had terminated at the time of the effective date of the amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporate licensees brought actions against appellants, seeking to declare &sect;&sect; 58-1003, 58-1010.1 unconstitutional because they required a petition signed by 35 percent of the registered voters of a county as a prerequisite to a liquor referendum. The trial court granted summary judgment to the licensees, ordering the call of an election. Appellants sought review, insisting that the licensees lacked standing to attack the constitutionality of the laws. The court agreed, explaining that, although the licensees could have attacked the statutes as individual citizens and potential consumers of intoxicating liquors, their complaints, brought in their corporate capacities, were based upon their alleged rights to have the liquor referendum laws construed so as to facilitate the issuance to them of licenses to sell intoxicating liquors. The licensees had no property rights to have such licenses issued to them, under O.C.G.A. &sect; 58-1068. Thus, they were without standing to attack the statutes' constitutionality. Further, they were not entitled to continue their purported &quot;lawful&quot; sales of intoxicating liquor, as these were unlawful sales of intoxicating liquor in a dry county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the summary judgments in favor of the licensees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of bribery and he appealed, urging that the trial court improperly refused to suppress wiretap evidence from a warrantless wiretap and erred in failing to quash the indictment that had been based on the fruits of the illegal wiretap. The State contended that the wiretap evidence was admissible in evidence even though obtained without the proper warrants because it was not unlawful. The court disagreed, explaining that the fact that the wiretap was not subject to prosecution under the statutes, did not alter the mandate of the Fourth Amendment, which rendered a warrantless wiretap an unlawful search and seizure. Thus, the court held that the wiretap evidence should not have been admitted. The court further held that the trial court properly denied the motion to quash the indictment because the evidence that the grand jury had received in finding a true bill was not subject to inquiry.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that it had no jurisdiction over the appeal. It noted that to properly raise a question as to the constitutionality of a &quot;law&quot; required: (1) stating the statute or the particular part or parts of a statute being challenged with fair precision; (2) clearly designating the constitutional provision allegedly violated; and (3) showing wherein the statute, or some designated part of it, violated such constitutional provision. The court held that defendant's attempted attack on the constitutionality of &quot;the Acts of 1970&quot; utterly failed to meet the first two of these requirements, if not in fact the third, and was, therefore, insufficient to draw in question before the trial court the constitutionality of any law.

The contract included a covenant to indemnify the railroad from loss, injury, or damage in connection with the facilities, resulting from the railroad's negligence or otherwise. The insurer sued the railroad after the brick company's property was damaged by the railroad. The railroad raised as a defense the indemnification covenant contained in the contract. The trial court held that the covenant was void as against public policy pursuant to a 1970 amendment to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 20-504. The railroad, contending that the amendment was unconstitutional, appealed. The court reversed as to the denial of its summary judgment motion against the insurer and affirmed the denial of its summary judgment motion against the brick company. The amendment was not subject to constitutional attack; however, it was not applicable here because the amendment was not intended to apply to contractual rights accruing prior to its enactment, which was the case here.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individuals alleged that the Georgia legislature had created a civil service system for the county and established a civil service board, that they had been duly elected to the board, but that the commissioners refused to perform their public duty of appointing the individuals to the board. The commissioners filed a motion to dismiss asserting that the individuals had no legal right to the claimed posts. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of mandamus on the ground that the provision of 1969 Ga. Laws under which the individuals claimed the right to office was expressly repealed by an ordinance adopted by the commissioners as authorized by the Home Rule Amendment for Counties to the Georgia Constitution, O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-8402 et seq. As to a claim that the commissioners had a duty to appoint the individuals because at the time they appeared before the board of commissioners the ordinance had not yet been certified by the Secretary of State as required by the Home Rule Amendment, the court ruled that although the individuals might have been entitled to mandamus on the date they appeared before the board they were not entitled to mandamus after the ordinance became effective.</SPAN></P>

The builder asserted that the ordinance imposed a charge in addition to all charges for building permits and that the revenue produced therefrom was to be allocated to the Board of Education, and therefore the charge was not a building permit fee or a license but a tax. The trial court held the ordinance unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, four county commissioners who were charged with malpractice in office, appealed from a judgment of the Henry Superior Court (Georgia), which denied their demurrers to the presentments against them, which were returned by a grand jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with malpractice in office concerning the entering of certain contracts and accepting of certain bids. The trial court overruled defendants' demurrers to the charges against them. In reversing in part, the court found that all of the counts charging that defendants improperly &quot;authorized&quot; purchases to be made without obtaining three bids were defective because the law applicable did not provide that &quot;authorizing&quot; a contract was equivalent to &quot;entering into&quot; or &quot;making&quot; a contract under O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-601. Further, the act creating the county board of which defendants were members contained no provision for receiving three bids for services. Thus, the counts alleging that defendants improperly failed to receive three bids were defective and subject to the demurrers urged. In addition, a charge that defendants failed to accept the lowest bid for a &quot;comparable model&quot; was defective because it failed to sufficiently allege that the lowest bids were for goods of the same quality. In affirming the trial court's judgment in part, the court found that certain statutory provisions that defendants challenged were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the portions of the trial court's judgment , which overruled the demurrers charging that defendants authorized purchases to be made without obtaining three bids and that defendants failed to accept the lowest bid. The court reversed other portions of the trial court's judgment in which the allegations lacked the requisite specificity. The court affirmed the remainder of the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The commissioner's determination that there was competition in service but not competition in rates was reasonable. The court rejected the insurer's assertion that its rates were not unreasonable because they were lower than the majority of companies because under Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 56-507(b), (c) the excessiveness of rates was to be individually examined for each insurer. When the insurer's individual performance was examined it was apparent that profits were higher than average and the rate increases were excessive in view of the insurer's actual experience.

The trial court ruled that the TRO remain in effect pending trial and that the motion to dismiss be granted for failure to join the member's replacement as an indispensable party.

The court also rejected the argument of the candidate for councilman that a presumption existed that the city exercised its charter power to provide that councilmen would be elected by a plurality of votes and that the burden of proof was on the contesting party to show otherwise.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver's license was suspended pursuant to the implied consent law. The driver named the Director and the officer, who was the Director's subordinate, in their individual capacities. On appeal, the court ruled that the Director's motion to dismiss should have been granted because venue as to him was in the county of residence, and not in the forum county. Because no activity in individual capacity was alleged and because none could be alleged to authorize the relief sought, the only theory upon which the driver could proceed, under the driver's allegations, was that defendants were acting under color of their offices. In such case they were required by law to act as they did until the implied consent law was held to be unconstitutional. They were not guilty of concerted action that authorized a complaint against either of them outside of their counties of residence. Moreover, because the driver did not exhaust his administrative remedies by challenging the suspension in the superior court of the county of his residence, or that of Fulton County, Georgia, under O.C.G.A. &sect;, 3A-120, the driver lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the implied consent law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 92-6912 granted the right of appeal from the arbitrators' decision when the difference between the valuation of the board of tax assessors and the valuation of the arbitrators exceeded $ 1,000. The ground of the attack was that the statute was discriminatory in that it denied to the taxpayer the equal protection of the laws in violation of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. II. The court held that to raise a question as to the constitutionality of a statute, it had to be shown wherein the statute violated the constitutional provision specified. The taxpayer's constitutional attack failed to state wherein the statute was discriminatory in violation of the constitutional provision specified. The attack was insufficient to raise the question of the statute's constitutionality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant litigants challenged a decision from the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), which enjoined the litigants from showing or exhibiting a certain film after the trial court determined the film was obscene. Plaintiff district attorney brought an action for an injunction against the showing of the film. The trial court also ordered the film seized as contraband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the hearing the trial judge viewed the film before making his finding that it was obscene. The film was produced in Sweden. It showed a young Swedish woman questioning the social, political, and moral values of her own country and other countries. In extended scenes the young woman and her various partners were shown in explicit sex scenes. On appeal, the litigants argued that the failure of the district attorney to introduce any evidence of community standards to determine the question of obscenity required a reversal of the judgment finding the film obscene. The court held that after viewing the film themselves, the trial judge did not err in finding the film obscene, whether viewed by the standards of the local community or national standards. The court held that the fact that the film contained some non-obscene matter did not preclude a finding it was utterly without redeeming social value. The court affirmed the finding that the film was obscene. The court held that where the welfare of the whole community was served by restraining the showing of the obscene film, a court of equity was authorized to enjoin the exhibition of the obscene film to the public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision enjoining the litigants from showing the film in question. However, the court directed that the trial court's order be amended to show that it was not a permanent injunction, but only one to continue in force until the final hearing of the case by a jury.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants were arrested on August 26, 1969, in a motel room in Bibb County, rented by one of them.  The arrest resulted from a search of the premises executed under a search warrant of the same date.  The search revealed quantities of LSD and &quot;marijuana&quot; (as spelled in Code Ann. &sect; 79A-903 (b, 5) Ga. L. 1967, pp. 296, 344, as amended, Ga. L. 1970, pp. 470, 471; or &quot;marihuana,&quot; as spelled in Code Ann. &sect; 79A-802 (13), Ga. L. 1967, pp. 296, 325, as amended, Ga. L. 1970, p. 470) and the defendants were charged with possession of narcotic drugs and possession of depressant or stimulant drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants filed demurrers to the indictments and moved to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the search on the grounds that the warrants were invalid due to their insufficiency to establish probable cause and that the search exceeded the scope authorized by the warrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing on the issues presented, the trial judge overruled the demurrers to the indictments and the motions to suppress.  The joint nonjury trial of both defendants resulted in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  their convictions on two counts, hereinabove stated, from which judgment they appeal.  Enumerated as error are the overruling of the defendants' motion for a new trial, their second and third demurrers to Count 2 of their indictments and their motion to suppress evidence.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After an informant advised law enforcement officials regarding defendants' possession of illicit drugs, a search warrant was executed at the hotel where defendants were staying.

Defendants appealed, and the court affirmed their convictions, holding that the trial court had properly denied the motions to suppress evidence because the State met its burden of proving that the search warrant was valid. The officer's affidavit gave sufficient information of the underlying circumstances from which he concluded that the informant was reliable. Further, the occurrence of the facts listed in the affidavit were recent enough to create a reasonable belief that the same conditions described in the affidavit still prevailed at the time of the issuance of the warrant. Section 79A-903(b)(3) was constitutional because although it referenced federal law, it did not make future federal legislation a part of the law in the State upon that subject.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate challenged the validity of the executive warrant on appeal, arguing that the demand, requisition, and supporting documents showed that the inmate was not a fugitive within the accepted meaning of that term. The inmate also contended that the statute of the demanding state under which he was charged was held to be unconstitutional. The court held that when, in the trial of a habeas corpus case, a petitioner was held in custody under an executive warrant based upon an extradition proceeding, and the warrant was regular on its face, the burden was on the petitioner to show some valid and sufficient reason why the warrant should not be executed. The presumption of the validity of the warrant continued until the contrary appeared. Upon such a showing, however, evidence as to the guilt or innocence of the inmate was not relevant because the courts of the asylum state could inquire into that question or into the constitutionality of the law under which the inmate was charged in the demanding state. In affirming, the court held that the warrant was issued pursuant O.C.G.A. &sect; 44-407 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act and was not void for any reason urged by the inmate.</SPAN></P>

Laws 356-357 did not violate Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; IV, par. I, the state constitution's equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature passed a law that greatly increased the minimal professional requirements for all county school superintendents; however, it also exempted, or grandfathered in, individuals who already held such positions when the act became effective or had served at least one term as a county school superintendent. Some county residents argued that provision violated the state constitution's equal protection clause and that the current superintendent of Columbia County schools was not qualified. The trial court disagreed, and the residents sought review. On review, the court held that the purpose of the act was to insure that qualified people held the office of county school superintendents. Permitting a class of experienced people to retain their positions despite the additional qualifications was a judgment call of the legislature that the court had to respect unless it was blatantly wrong. The court held that it could not say as a matter of law that permitting experienced people to keep their jobs was not a legitimate ground of differentiation or bore no reasonable relation to the law's objectives. Because the law applied to all candidates statewide, it was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Dougherty County (Georgia), which upheld the constitutionality of a statute that required counties with populations between 70,000 and 110,000 residents to create a board known as the board of trustees of the county law library. Appellants' complaint was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature enacted a statute that required counties with populations between 70,000 and 110,000 residents to create a county law library. The population determination was to be made under the 1960 United States census or any future census. Under the 1960 census, one county was affected; under the 1970 census, four counties were affected. The statute was challenged, but the trial court determined that it was constitutional. On appeal, the court noted that the legislature could classify for purposes of legislation but that the basis of the classification had to have some reasonable relation to the subject matter of the law. A statute that involved classification by population was required to be a general, not a special statute, which let a county out of the classification as well as in. The classification must not have been crafted to apply to only one county. The classification by population must have had some reasonable relation to the subject matter and a legitimate ground for differentiation. The classification had no reasonable relationship to the subject matter, and it was a special statute that violated the special laws provision of the Georgia Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Houston County (Georgia), which convicted defendant of the possession of gambling devices. Defendant sought direct appeal before the court, and not the Court of Appeals, on the grounds that O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-3004(a) of the Invasion of Privacy Statute, O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-3001 et seq., which exempted law enforcement officers from its application, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The only issue before the court was whether it had the jurisdiction to hear defendant's appeal. Normally, an appeal of a misdemeanor conviction would be before the Court of Appeals. But defendant argued that the portion of the Invasion of Privacy Statute that precluded its operation against law enforcement officers was unconstitutional and that, therefore, the evidence in his case should have been suppressed. On review, the court held that it had a duty to determine whether it had the jurisdiction to hear the appeal. To determine that, the court had to decide if a constitutional question was presented on the record. The court concluded that based on the record, the police officer viewed the illegal gambling equipment from a public place, as defined by O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-401(M), and not a private place protected under the statute. Consequently, the constitutionality of the statute was not at issue, and the jurisdiction of the appeal rested solely with the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal from a conviction, in the State Court of Glynn County, of the offense of distributing obscene materials, Code Ann. &sect; 26-2101 (Ga. L. 1968, pp. 1249, 1302), which provides in part as follows: &quot;(a) A person commits the offense of distributing obscene materials when he sells, lends, rents, leases, gives, advertises, publishes, exhibits or otherwise disseminates to any person any obscene material of any description, knowing the obscene nature thereof, or who offers to do so, or who possesses such material with the intent so to do.  (b) Material is obscene if considered as a whole, applying community standards, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and utterly without redeeming social value and if, in addition, it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in describing or representing such matters.  Undeveloped photographs, molds, printing plates and the like shall be deemed obscene notwithstanding that processing or other acts may be required to make the obscenity patent or to disseminate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it.  (c) Material, not otherwise obscene, may be deemed obscene under this section if the distribution thereof, or the offer to do so, or the possession with the intent to do so is a commercial exploitation of erotica solely for the sake of their prurient appeal.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Glynn State Court (Georgia) convicting him of the offense of distributing obscene materials, a violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2101. The trial court denied defendant's motions to dismiss, for a directed verdict, for a new trial, and in arrest of judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued on appeal from his conviction for the distribution of obscene materials that O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2101 was not violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution on the ground of vagueness. On review, the court disagreed. The court also disagreed with the argument that &sect; 26-2101 was violative of the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution on the ground that the constitutional right to mere possession of obscene material necessarily implied the right to purchase such material and, hence, the right of others to distribute it. The court relied on a United States Supreme Court opinion which specifically negated any relationship of interdependence between the states' recognized broad power to regulate the public distribution of obscenity and the mere possession of such material by the individual in the privacy of his home. In affirming, the court held that the jury was correctly charged as to the statutory definition of obscene material, as contained in O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2101(b), (c). The evidence authorized the jury's finding that the material sold by defendant came within the statutory definition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a company and two county boards of education, appealed an order of the Haralson Superior Court (Georgia), which sustained appellee city's motion to dismiss the petition attacking certain statutes and annexation ordinances and sought an injunction to prevent the city's collection of the 1969 taxes in the annexed areas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city annexed four tracts of land, two under the 60 percent method and two under the 100 percent method. Two of the annexations extended the city into the neighboring county. Appellants challenged the annexations as violative of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 69-904 and the trial court dismissed their petition. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that, in view of the local nature of municipal annexation and Ga. Const. art. XV, &sect; I, para. I (1954), the general assembly could delegate its power to extend city boundaries. However, the two annexations under the 60 percent method were illegal and void because they violated the prohibition in Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 69-904, 69-908 against the annexation of territory across the boundary lines of political subdivisions. A school district was a political subdivision and each county composed one school district; thus, the ban included school districts. Also, because one of the 100 percent annexation ordinances was contiguous to one of the void 60 percent annexations, that 100 percent annexation ordinance was illegal and void and the city had no authority to levy and collect taxes there.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 27-303 (1966) and because police officers had probable cause to believe the seized articles were stolen; and (3) jurors had more than the mere fact of appellant's possession of the seized articles to rely on as evidence that he knew they were stolen and thus, appellant's conviction was proper.</SPAN></P>

The Baldwin Superior Court (Georgia) declared the Act of 1941, O.C.G.A. &sect; 67-1308 unconstitutional. The debtor appealed the judgment adverse to her, and the bank appealed the trial court's judgment overruling other defenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bank argued that the Act was unconstitutional. The court held that as applied to deeds to secure debt executed after the effective date of such Act such Act did not offend the constitutional provisions prohibiting retrospective legislation. The court reversed the judgment declaring the Act unconstitutional and striking allegations with reference to such Act. The bank contended that the Act was unconstitutional because the caption made no reference to the duty of the clerk of the superior court to record deeds to secure debt while the body of the Act made such provision and sets fees for such services. The court held that the language of the title was sufficiently broad to include the language complained of. The bank contended that the trial court erred in overruling its motion to dismiss the cause for failure of the debtor to state a claim. The bank contended that the debtor failed to name a necessary party. The court held that because neither the motion to dismiss nor the judgment of the trial court disclosed any intent to raise or pass upon such question the failure to name the party was an amendable defect not subject to being dismissed for failure to state a claim.</SPAN></P>

The board appealed a decision that enjoined them from serving free breakfasts in some schools under the Child Nutrition Act, 42 U.S.C.S. ch. 13A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board adopted a school desegregation plan. In the plan, white students were bussed distances to predominately Negro schools while Negro students were bussed distances to primarily white schools. As such, white and Negro children were denied admission to public school facilities available to other white and Negro children similarly situated. Parents initiated an action to enjoin the plan on the grounds that it violated the Equal Protection Clause. The parents also alleged that the board's practice of serving free breakfasts in certain schools and not others violated the clause. The trial court denied the injunction regarding the plan, ordered the board to submit a new plan to the trial court, and enjoined the board from serving free breakfasts. In reversing the decision in part, the court found that the plan violated equal protection principles by effectively excluding students from attending a school based upon their race. The trial court also erred in enjoining the board from serving free breakfasts because the board was complying with the Child Nutrition Act. The court affirmed in part the trial court's decision, but did not explain its affirmance.</SPAN></P>

The illegitimate daughter filed an action seeking to inherit her father's estate after he died intestate. The trial court held that she was not entitled to inherit the estate under O.C.G.A. &sect; 113-904. She asserted that the denial of her right of inheritance violated the Fourteenth Amendment by denying her equal protection. The court held that the right of succession to the property of a deceased person was not a natural and inalienable right guaranteed by the Constitution. As such, each state had the power to regulate and control such succession as it deemed necessary.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Bennie W. Brown filed an action in the Superior Court of DeKalb County in which she sought to recover from Maurice Olen the amount of a judgment obtained previously against Merit Dollar Stores, Inc.  Olen is alleged to be a resident of Alabama and service and jurisdiction is sought under the Act of 1966 (Ga. L. 1966, p. 343) as amended (Code Ann. &sect; 24-113.1 et seq.).  The defendant made a special appearance for the purpose of raising the issue of jurisdiction of the court over his person and moved to quash the process on that ground.  In addition to alleging that he had not transacted any business in Georgia or committed any tortious act in Georgia, he attacks the above Act as violating various provisions of the State and United States Constitutions &quot;in so far as [the Act] . . . purports,&quot; etc.  The trial court sustained the defendant's motion &quot;as to jurisdiction&quot; without specifying the ground upon which the judgment was based.

He alleged that he had not transacted any business in Georgia or committed any tortious act in Georgia, and asserted that the Act was unconstitutional. The superior court sustained the motion and plaintiff appealed. The court held that plaintiff's petition was not defective for not being verified, so as to prevent the superior court from obtaining jurisdiction over defendant, because the Act did not require it have been verified. However, the petition did not allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action, precluding the superior court from obtaining jurisdiction over defendant. The petition failed to assert that the corporation's assets had been liquidated or the funds derived therefrom appropriated to defendant's own use.

They also sought to enjoin the insurance companies from disbursing any funds for the payment of the property owners' taxes. The trial court dismissed the property owners' complaint on the motion of the governmental entities and insurance companies. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court ruled that the property owners had not done equity by paying taxes owed. Therefore, they were not entitled to equitable relief. O.C.G.A. &sect; 92-6402 required the property owners to pay taxes owed by a certain date. The property owners had not done so. The court found that it was apparent from their complaint that the property owners did not claim that they did not owe any taxes. Therefore, in order to do equity, the taxes acknowledged to be owed must have been paid or tendered in order to afford the property owners an opportunity to have their case considered on the issue that the taxes were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the officer was authorized under O.C.G.A. &sect; 68-406.3 to direct defendant to the scales. The court found that the State could impose reasonable conditions on the issuance of a driver's license, including forfeiting a driver's license for 90 days for failure to comply with an officer's direction to have a vehicle weighed. The court found that defendant was not compelled to comply. His refusal did not result in a penalty but in the breach of a condition upon which his right to operate the truck was predicated. The court concluded that defendant's constitutional protection against self-incrimination was not violated. The court ruled that defendant was not entitled to the warnings prescribed by the Escobedo and Miranda cases because the evidence obtained was not a result of an &quot;in-custody&quot; interrogation.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs claimed that there were no such provisions in the Georgia Code that had been enacted by the Georgia General Assembly and that defendants' claim that plaintiffs were barred as a matter of law from maintaining their action had to be predicated on the Act of 1949, 1949 Ga. Laws 1143, which plaintiffs claimed violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect;10 and O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-302, Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, para. 2. The court found that all of plaintiffs' enumerations of error contended that the Act violated provisions of the U.S. Constitution and the Georgia Constitution but that the argument made in plaintiffs' brief related solely to the provisions of one section of the Act and that no contention was made as to the remainder of the Act being unconstitutional for any reason. Thus, the trial court's judgment overruling the motion to strike on the ground that the Act was unconstitutional did not constitute reversible error.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that: (1) a motion to quash indictments on the ground that there had been systematic exclusion of an ethnic group from the grand jury was improper because the proper method for raising errors in an indictment was a challenge to the array before the indictment was returned, unless it was shown that defendant had no knowledge of such illegality prior to the indictment; (2) the exclusion of certain evidence was proper because it did not reasonably tend to support the charge of systematic exclusion; (3) 1953 Ga. Laws 256, which provided that in all Superior Court Judicial Circuits, jurors were competent to serve during the year not more than 20 days and which was applicable only to two counties, was not unconstitutional; and (4) the trial court erred by excusing two jurors solely on the basis that they stated on a voir dire question that they were conscientiously opposed to capital punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction for rape and death sentence was upheld by the court. After an appeal to the court from the denial of habeas corpus relief, the court remanded defendant to the trial court for a new jury trial on the sentence issue only. Defendant was again sentenced to death. After the trial court denied his motion for new trial, defendant filed an appeal. The court upheld the sentence. It held that the trial court had correctly charged the jury on alibi as it pertained to the sentencing issue. The applicable sentencing statute, O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-1302, was constitutional. As long as the legislature provided for the death penalty in cases of forcible rape, the court would uphold it. The fact that the death penalty was meted out disproportionately upon black men was not a denial of due process or of equal protection under the laws. Evidence of the crime was properly admitted and the new trial was not prohibited by the double jeopardy provisions of the Georgia and Federal Constitutions. The court had authority under O.C.G.A. &sect; 6-1610 to order the retrial of the sentence only. Finally, the trial court properly excluded immaterial, academic evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers filed an action against the authorities, which sought equitable relief concerning the collection of property taxes. The trial court relied on precedent from the court, which held that the taxpayers were not entitled to equitable relief because of the failure to make a tender of the 1969 taxes upon their property. At the time that the complaint was filed, and at the time of the interlocutory hearing, no 1969 taxes were due, and the authorities could not have accepted any payment on 1969 taxes. The court concluded that it was error to deny the interlocutory injunction and dismiss the complaint on the ground of the failure to tender the 1969 taxes. In so doing it explicitly overruled Walker v. Burns, 220 Ga. 467 and its progeny. The court also noted that the authorities use of outside appraisal experts and others experiential knowledge was not improper. There was a sufficient compliance with the five-day notice requirement of O.C.G.A. &sect; 92-6911. However, it was apparent that personal property valuations were not based on fair market value and were not fairly and justly equalized, as required by Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; I, para. III.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Raymond Walden was convicted of the crime of receiving, harboring, or concealing guilty persons.  Code &sect; 26-4601.  His appeal from the judgment of the trial court overruling his motion for new trial is pending in the Georgia Court of Appeals.  He subsequently sued out a writ of habeas corpus, attacking the constitutionality of Code &sect; 26-4601 on the grounds, generally and substantially, that it abridged his rights under the 4th, 5th and 14th Amendments to the Federal Constitution in that it fails to define what constitutes a violation thereunder and makes the conviction of the principal unnecessary for conviction of the crime of an accessory.  The trial court granted the writ, held the aforesaid statute to be unconstitutional and ordered the release of the prisoner, from which judgment the respondent Sheriff of Fulton County appeals.  </SPAN></P>

The court agreed and reversed the judgment. If there was any ambiguity in the statute under which the prisoner was convicted, the meaning and purpose of the statute was adequately explained in its construction by the state's appellate courts. To hold the statute unconstitutional because the principal did not need to have been convicted would have defeated the obvious purpose of the statute to prevent a criminal from escaping the consequences of his crime by avoiding arrest, prosecution, or punishment. The authoritative interpretation of the statute by the state's highest appellate courts put those words in the statute as definitely as if it had been so amended by the legislature. Furthermore, the statute was not subject to any of the prisoner's specific constitutional attacks. If the indictment was defective for any other reasons, the prisoner waived those defects by going to trial without complaint.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held the Act unconstitutional on the ground that the notice published in a local newspaper was insufficient. Defendants appealed this ruling. The trial court overruled other attacks on the constitutionality of the Act, and plaintiffs cross appealed. On appeal, the court held that the public was bound to know that the notice in the required publication had reference to the only office in the county government having any relation to collecting taxes. Thus, the public was put on notice of whatever facts a prudent inquiry would have revealed. The court concluded that the Act was not unconstitutional. The legislature was free to deal with one or more county offices to remedy the evil which it found to exist, and it was not necessary to revise the method of compensating all public officials in order to deal in one Act with one official.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment from the trial court that found the act unconstitutional but affirmed the trial court's decision to overrule the remaining attacks on the constitutionality of the act.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) no pervasive prejudice existed in the community prior to defendant's trial which denied him a fair trial; (2) there was no error in the trial court's refusal to allow defendant and his attorney to appear before the grand jury as defendant was not on trial and neither his right of confrontation nor equal protection of the laws were at issue; (3) Ga.

The court found that the language of Georgia's long arm statute could not have been reasonably construed to have included corporations because the words &quot;or his executor or administrator&quot; in the statute referred to a natural person. The court concluded that the interpretation of a statute was not a judicial function but was determined by the intention of the legislature and that it would have been an unreasonable construction of the language used in the long arm statue prior to amendment to hold that the word &quot;nonresident&quot; as used in the statute was intended to include foreign corporations. The court held that it was not the intention of the General Assembly to include corporations. The court noted that the 1966 Act, as amended by the 1968 Act, could not have been applied to the cause of action against the corporation arising prior to the effective date of the 1968 amendment, and the trial court erred in denying the corporation's motion to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The union sought to represent the majority of the firefighter employees of the city as bargaining agent for the improvement of hours, wages, and conditions of employment.

The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court agreed with the trial court that 1968 Ga. Laws p. 2953 was unconstitutional. The effect of the 1968 special legislation would have been to place restrictions, in the form of mandatory collective bargaining, upon the unlimited powers granted by the 1962 general law, 1962 Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county attempted to impose on the various businesses and professionals a license fee that, among other things, purported to regulate business within the county and to make the failure to pay such fee punishable as for a misdemeanor. In a prior action affecting the county, the court nullified an attempt by the county to impose a county tax. The court, in affirming the grant of the injunction, first found that the portion of the ordinance, which attempted to impose a penalty for failure to pay the fee, violated the Home Rule Amendment of the Georgia Constitution, O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-8402(c)(3), and was therefore void. Next, noting that the ordinance contained provisions that appeared to be regulatory in nature, the court nevertheless found that it was merely a tax disguised as a license. In light of its prior determination that the county lacked taxing authority under Georgia's statutes or constitution, the court found that the ordinance was an attempt by the county to impose and collect an occupational tax. Accordingly, the court concluded that the ordinance was null and void.</SPAN></P>

The Act created the Board, but the citizens raised a number of constitutional challenges. The citizens alleged that the election would deprive them of their choice in the running of the county. The court agreed on appeal that the superior court's decision was correct. The court first rejected the contention that proper notice of the Act was not published. An earlier publication of a similar bill that was not passed met the notice requirement when it was a part of the enrolled bill. Second, the Georgia General Assembly had the full authority to create county commissioners under Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; 17, para. I (1945) (Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-5201). The court then found that the Act was not an unconstitutional infringement on the ordinary because the legislature had the legal right to limit the ordinary's authority. Finally, the requirement that Board members must be a resident of the particular district where the member lived was not unlawful because the members were elected county-wide.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a second wife and nephew, appealed the decisions from the Superior Court of Jenkins County (Georgia), which denied their motions for summary judgment in the suit by plaintiff first wife to remove the clouds to her title to property filed against the second wife, the nephew, and defendant credit association. The first wife also appealed the denial of her partial summary judgment motion for title to one tract only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A landowner divorced the first wife and remarried. The first wife argued that her opponents sought to defraud her. The second wife was the aunt of the nephew. The landowner had executed a promissory note to a bank secured by a deed to one tract. Through a series of transfers, two tracts were deeded to the first wife with a life estate reservation. The husband then conveyed one tract to the second wife with a life estate reservation. The bank transferred its deed to the second wife. The husband that renewed his note. At some point, the second wife conveyed her interests to the nephew. On appeal, the court favored the first wife and the nephew. The bank's interests could have been transferred to the second wife. The Acts of 1941 and 1953 described in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 67-1308, which the first wife contended barred the transfer, were unconstitutional because they impaired the obligation of contracts. In summary, when the nephew acquired one tract from a chain from the husband to the nephew, his interests were valid. However, the second wife did not acquire a second tract through adverse possession because the seven-year period for possession was not met.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the overruling of the first wife's partial summary judgment motion regarding the second tract. The court reversed the overruling of the nephew's summary judgment motion. In all other respects, the decisions below were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney brought an action against the state bar and its officials alleging that they were proceeding against him without authority of law in a disciplinary matter. He further stated that the law under which the state bar was created, 1963 Ga. Laws 70-72, and the rules of the state bar violated the state and federal constitutions. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss an equitable complaint; declared 70-72 unconstitutional, and granted an injunction. The court held that the license fee required under the rules was not a professional tax on attorneys and that a municipality was not precluded from levying a tax on attorneys because of the license fee paid to the state bar. Therefore, the trial court erred in holding that the fee was a tax or gratuity and unconstitutional. The court further held that the State Bar Act (Act) did not deprive the attorney of his freedom of contract, conscience, speech, and liberty, and did not deprive him of his property without due process of law. Further, there was no merit in the contention that the Act did not authorize the adoption of disciplinary rules and regulations; the trial judge erred in holding the Act void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed a number of errors, including objections to two women who were unqualified to serve on the jury, the failure to grant attorney's fees and costs when defendant had appointed counsel, and the taking of defendant's fingerprints and the admission thereof. On appeal, the court found no reversible errors. Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 59-112 allowed women to exempt from service, but it did not deal with eligibility for jury service. Further, the right was personal and could not be urged by defendant. Therefore, there was no error in allowing the women on the jury. The superior court could have denied access to the State's files of its investigators. A challenge to the constitutionality of the attorney's fees statute was too vague to be reviewed. Defendant's counsel had the right to fees and expenses accounted for after trial, but his request was made at the start of trial. The fingerprints were taken while defendant was in lawful detention, his counsel was notified, and there was no objection. Jurors who objected to the death penalty under any circumstances could have been excused for cause. Other objections to the selection of the jury were disregarded.</SPAN></P>

A mandamus nisi was issued, but the trial court rendered a judgment denying the mandamus absolute. Affirming, the court first ruled that it would not decide a constitutional question where the case could be made upon other grounds. The wife failed to attach a copy of her petition for divorce to her mandamus petition; thus, the court could not determine whether the grant of a writ of mandamus to her would be of any benefit. The wife also stated that she was not suggesting she had a right to a divorce and, as a result, she failed to show that the grant of the writ would be beneficial to her. A writ of mandamus was not available where another specific remedy was available.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tax assessment; constitutional question.  Houston Superior Court.  Before Judge Culpepper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a continuation of a sales and use tax case heretofore considered on appeal and reported in Undercofler v. Grantham Transfer Co., 114 Ga. App. 868, supra, and 222 Ga. 654 (151 SE2d 765). The case as previously reported in this court has no bearing on the issues here as it involved only a certified question of the Court of Appeals on appellate procedure.  The case in the Court of Appeals was to review the grant in part and the denial in part of summary judgment on appeal to the superior court from an assessment of the Revenue Commissioner.  The Court of Appeals held that a disputed issue existed presenting a jury question as to whether leased equipment or machinery was under the exclusive control of the lessor Grantham.  The case involves, in the main, an arrangement of Grantham in which it leased, loaned, or contracted its equipment and machinery including certain services to motor common carriers in interstate commerce in which the written agreements granted exclusive possession, control and use of the motor vehicles involved when operated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by or for such carrier.  The affirmance by the Court of Appeals merely left the case pending in the court below, and it proceeded to trial.  Both parties moved for directed verdict, and the lower court then discharged the jury and ordered as follows: (1) The third unnumbered paragraph of &sect; 4a of the Sales and Use Tax Act, as amended (Ga. L. 1955, pp. 389, 390; Code Ann. &sect; 92-3448a) is not unconstitutional for any reason assigned; (2) The written agreements by and between Grantham and the motor common carriers are not leases taxable under the Sales and Use Tax Act (Code Ann. Ch. 92-34a, as amended), and the appeal from the assessment was sustained and set aside in a stated amount; (3) The sales (purchases) of certain tangible personal property by Grantham were taxable transactions, and the company had failed to pay these, thus in effect, authorizing the assessment by the Revenue Commissioner in a stated sum; (4) A lease of tangible personal property by the company was a taxable transaction, and the company having failed to pay the taxes thereon, the assessment was likewise sustained in a stated amount; (5) Certain sales (purchases) of tangible personal property were not taxable; yet&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the company had paid tax thereon; and (6) A judgment was rendered for the Commissioner for a stated amount, including delinquency penalty and accrued interest for the taxable period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assessment involved, in the main, the question of whether or not the commissioner was correct in holding the written agreements were leases and requiring Grantham to collect and pay taxes thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appeal by Grantham is that the trial court erred in (1) Overruling its constitutional attack upon &quot;the third unnumbered paragraph of Section 4a&quot; of the 1955 amendment to the Sales and Use Tax Act (Ga. L. 1955, pp. 389, 390; Code Ann. &sect; 92-3448a); and (2) Rendering judgment against it for sums claimed to be due in (a) the sale of tangible personal property originally purchased allegedly for its own use, and (b) the leasing of tangible personal property from others.  It likewise enumerates error on the allowance in evidence of certain testimony; the refusal to allow certain testimony; the impeachment of the commissioner's witness by his counsel; and the refusal to grant in its entirety Grantham's motion for directed verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cross appeal by the Revenue Commissioner is from the holding by the trial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judge that the written agreements between Grantham and the motor common carriers did not result in taxable transactions under the Sales and Use Tax Act.  </SPAN></P>

The other two documents in dispute did not use the lessor/lessee description, but rather referred to the parties as contractor and carrier, but essentially contained the same provisions as the leases. The taxpayer asserted that the transactions were for services, and the equipment was incidental thereto. The trial court found the six transaction in question to not be leases of equipment and not taxable. The commissioner appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's findings and held that the transactions were all leases and taxable as such.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following reversal by the Supreme Court (Georgia) of an initial conviction, defendant was retried and again convicted and sentenced to death. He claimed that the second conviction should be reversed because he was denied a speedy trial, in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. VI; O.C.G.A. &sect; 1-806; Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. V; O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-105, in that 18 months elapsed between the commission of the crime and the second trial. He also claimed that the jury was not a fair cross-section of the population. On review, the court found no merit to the claims. The delay in the second trial occurred when defendant appealed from his first conviction, so there was no denial of a constitutional right to a speedy trial.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a suit to enjoin the alleged illegal operation of a private bank after the passage of legislation requiring all persons doing a private banking business in this State to be chartered under the banking laws (Code Ann. &sect; 13-204; Ga. L. 1960, p. 1170; 1966, p. 691; 1966, pp. 692, 715) and meet the requirements of the Regulated Certificated Bank Act (Ga. L. 1966, pp. 692, 716; Code Ann. Ch. 13-23).  The defendant in his answer, as amended, (1) denied the authority of the Superintendent of Banks to bring this action; (2) alleged he had made application as a private banker to become a State Certificated Bank under the above law but the Superintendent of Banks refused to grant a certificated bank charter or certificate as required by the law; and (3) attacked the legislation requiring him to cease doing business as a sole proprietor and become incorporated and meet the various requirements of law as being unconstitutional, null and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case proceeded to an interlocutory hearing of the request for a temporary injunction based upon an affidavit and a stipulation of certain facts as follows: (1) the defendant is a private&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  banker who commenced operations during December 1959, under the ownership of a predecessor; (2) registered with the Superintendent of Banks as a private banker in 1966; (3) filed an application for incorporation as a regulated certificated bank pursuant to said legislation approved in 1966, which was disapproved by the Superintendent under &sect; 11 (b) of the Act, all of which application and disapproval was attached to the stipulation as exhibits, showing a determination that the applicants were not actively engaged in the banking business.  The constitutional attacks upon the legislation are based upon (1) denial of equal protection, (2) denial of due process, and (3) destruction of defendant's business without due compensation therefor.  The court denied the request for injunction and held: (1) the parties agree that defendant is engaged in the private banking business; (2) by legislation the General Assembly has undertaken to prohibit all private banking and restrict the right to conduct such banking business to corporations; and (3) the legislation is therefore unconstitutional, null and void in denying the right to individuals to carry on a lawful business, thereby destroying the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant's lawfully existing business without compensation.

The trial court ruled for defendant on the grounds that the law was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court disagreed and reversed that ruling. It held that defendant must comply with Georgia law to operate a private bank.

On review, the court found that only the first indictment for selling and possessing amphetamines could be considered under the petition because the prisoner had not yet begun to serve his sentence on the second indictment. The court held that tit. 79A was not unconstitutional as violating Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; 7, para. 8, which prohibited the inclusion of more than subject in any act of the general assembly. The court reasoned that the legislature grouped all persons authorized to manufacture, sale, and possess drugs, poisons, and cosmetics.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The residents appealed the trial court's judgment refusing to hold Section II of the Act unconstitutional. On appeal, as to the residents' argument that the Act was a legislative construction of the meaning of words and constituted an exercise of the function of the judicial division of the government and that the trial court erred in refusing to so rule, the court held that if the general assembly was authorized to designate a municipal corporation as a &quot;city&quot; or &quot;town&quot; it could not be said that it was without authority to abolish such distinctions for statutory purposes and declare that when municipal corporations were referred to either as &quot;town&quot; or as &quot;city&quot; in an act of the general assembly, such language was to be deemed synonymous; thus, the first enumeration of error which complained of the use of the term &quot;city&quot; and &quot;town&quot; interchangeably was without merit. The enrolled Act, a copy of which was attached as a petition exhibit, showed that a certain individual was one of the authors and that he executed an affidavit showing the necessary publication.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer alleged that the Act was unconstitutional because the advertisement attached to the Act did not comply with the requirements of Ga. Const. of 1945, art. III, &sect; 7, para. 15. Two proposed acts were involved in the dispute. H.B. 734, Gen. Assem. (Ga. 1968); 1968 Ga. Laws 2290, made the amendments to the Act and were expressly set forth in the advertisement. However, H.B. 679, Gen. Assem. (Ga. 1968); 1968 Ga. Laws 2149, amended the Act by making changes that were not included in the purpose of the Act. On review, the court noted that if the advertisement had contained language that expressed an intention to amend the Act, the advertisement would have been sufficient. However, the court also stated that under reasonable rules of construction, more information regarding the law to be enacted was not required in the caption of the bill. The court found that H.B. 679, Gen. Assem. (Ga. 1968), 1968 Ga. Laws 2290, only contained matters completely foreign to the avowed intent contained in the advertisement; it therefore did not meet the requirements of the Georgia Constitution regarding the necessary advertisement of a local act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought a review of his conviction for burglary, alleging that 1967 Ga. Laws 251, which amended the jury selection statute, O.C.G.A. &sect; 59-106, was vague and indefinite. Defendant argued that the jury selection statute excluded black persons and women from the jury. On review, the court found that the statute was not subject to the attack because the purpose of its adoption was to secure a more representative cross-section of the intelligent citizens, which included black persons and women. In addition, the court held that 1967 Ga. Laws 725 was not unconstitutional when it excluded certain persons, such as lawyers, police officers, and firemen from jury duty because 1967 Ga. Laws 725 did not arbitrarily exclude them from service if they made a written request to be chosen. The court determined that mere automatic exemption of certain citizens who had a right to serve if they desired did not result in the jury lists chosen not being representative. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to justify a guilty verdict, as one of defendant's companions was found with clothes from the burglary.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the attorney was ineligible to serve as solicitor general. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that although the attorney was admitted to the practice of law during the three years immediately prior to his election, the attorney never registered or paid any license fee to the bar until &quot;right before&quot; he entered the race for solicitor general. Therefore the attorney did not lawfully practice law for the three years preceding the election because Ga. Bar Rule 1-203 and 1-204 stated that no person could legally practice law without first registering and paying the fee. Furthermore, the court held that the practice of law was a function of the judiciary, which disposed of the attorney's arguments asserting that he was deprived of the right to have his duties and obligations defined by the general assembly.</SPAN></P>

Their cases had been consolidated. Defendants enumerated as error: (a) the overruling of their demurrers to the accusation and sentence, and (b) the sustaining of the motion by the State to dismiss their motion to quash the accusation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Their demurrers and motion to quash and dismiss the accusation were on the grounds (a) that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-6203, with which they were charged with violating, offended the due process and equal protection clauses of the Federal and state Constitutions in that the statute was vague and indefinite, and (b) that they were entrapped by the arresting officer. The court found that the word prostitution in the statute was not vague and indefinite. A person of ordinary intelligence knew the meaning of the words &quot;prostitute&quot; and &quot;prostitution.&quot; The statute was not unconstitutional. The defense of entrapment was without substance because entrapment existed where the idea and the intention to commit the act originated with an officer, who, by undue persuasion and deceitful means, induced a defendant to violate the law. The arresting officer's testimony was that while he was on duty, in a bar one of the defendants had stated that she could get him a girl if he wanted one. They met later at a motel and defendants both offered to have relations with him for $ 40 a piece. Neither the trial nor the lower court had committed error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff challenged the judgment of the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), which determined that Ga. Code &sect; 105-2003 violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, and which denied plaintiff's motion to compel defendant to answer interrogatories regarding his personal assets and financial condition in an action that asserted an injury to plaintiff's peace, happiness, or feelings and sought punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After plaintiff filed a claim that alleged intentional wrongdoing by defendant and sought punitive damages, plaintiff sought information during discovery that pertained to defendant's financial condition. The trial court denied plaintiff's motion to compel defendant to provide the information on the grounds that Ga. Code &sect; 105-2003 violated the equal protection clause. Plaintiff appealed, and the court reversed, holding that most of the states allowed consideration of defendant's financial condition in the determination of the amount of punitive damages. Ga. Code &sect; 105-2003 required consideration of defendant's financial condition and the amount of bad faith in the transaction with all the attendant facts. Because a wealthy defendant would not feel a sting if a minor punitive award was given to a plaintiff, it was reasonable to consider the wealth of defendant. Due process was not violated because &sect; 105-2003 did not make a visible or arbitrary classification of persons according to wealth, and it was a fair and equitable rule to deter gross misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Fulton Civil Court (Georgia) allowed defendant tenants, in filing their defense to a dispossessory warrant, to file their counter-affidavits without first posting a bond, as required by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 61-303, and held that the tenants be permitted to assert their defenses without being subjected to the double rent provision of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 61-305. Plaintiffs, the State of Georgia and the Housing Authority of the City of Atlanta, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court had held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 61-303, 305 were unconstitutional. The court reversed. The court stated that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 61-303, requiring a tenant filing a defense to a dispossessory warrant to post a bond to secure the landlord, was not unreasonable because (1) it was entirely appropriate and equitable, under the due process clause of the United States Constitution and the Georgia Constitution, to guarantee payment to the landlord while a tenant resisted eviction and had the use and benefit of the premises; and (2) the fact that a tenant was indigent and unable to furnish a bond did not permit a different conclusion. The court stated that it was not unreasonable to allow appropriate damages, as provided by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 61-305, against a tenant for unlawfully withholding possession of the landlord's premises because such damages were reasonably calculated to compensate the landlord for having been unlawfully denied the use of his premises and to deter a tenant from asserting frivolous defenses to a rightful dispossession. The court concluded that the provisions were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers were residents of a city in which the tax assessor, purporting to act under proper authority of 1962 Ga. Laws 3172-3180, assessed their property. It was alleged that 1962 Ga. Laws 3172-3180 was enacted under the authority of 1956 Ga. Laws 453-456. The court held that 1956 Ga. Laws 453-456 authorized cities to consolidate boards of tax assessors and vest the assessment authority in those boards. The court determined that, because 1962 Ga. Laws 3172-3180 vested that same authority in one officer, the tax assessor, it was unconstitutional. Because the act was unconstitutional, the court further found that the taxpayers were not required to follow the requirements for seeking a remedy from the act and could seek review in a court of equity. The court further ruled that, because the assessments would continue unless 1962 Ga. Laws 3172-3180 was declared void, the taxpayers were not estopped from bringing their action.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the trial judge erred in overruling the motion. The court explained that a suit could not be maintained against the State without its statutory consent. The court explained that such rule could not be evaded by making an action nominally against the servants or agents of a State when the real claim was against the State itself and the State was the party vitally interested. The court concluded that where a suit was brought against an officer or agency of the State with relation to some matter in which a defendant represented the State in action and liability, and the State, while not a party to the record, was the real party against which relief was sought so that a judgment for the plaintiff, although nominally against the named defendant as an individual or entity distinct from the State, would have operated to control the action of the State or subject it to liability, the suit was in effect one against the State.</SPAN></P>

The lower court sustained the principal and surety's attack on the constitutionality of the general assembly act. The principal and surety abandoned their constitutional attack on appeal. They argued that the bond holder's action against the principal was filed too late to be covered by the and that since the principal had later been declared bankrupt the summary judgment was still properly rendered. The court reversed the judgment because it found that the bond was voluntarily filed and by its terms bound the surety to pay upon default of the principal. The bond was filed after the principal's bankruptcy discharge and was an express promise in writing signed by the principal, thus meeting the requirements of O.C.G.A. &sect; 3-902 and the requirement that the action be filed in the prescribed period of time, which could be waived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged by accusation with two counts of possession of non-tax-paid liquor and two counts of selling liquor without a state license. Defendant filed general demurrers to the accusations, contending that O.C.G.A. &sect; 58-1065 (1937-38) was unconstitutional. The trial court overruled the demurrers and convicted defendant on all counts. Upon review, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that &sect; 58-1065 was adequately clear and definite to apprise one of the acts that it intended to prohibit. Thus, it was not violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution for vagueness. The court found that the sale of liquor in Georgia was a privilege, not a right pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 58-1068 (1937-38). Thus, defendant's position that he had a right to possess and sell liquor and that to refuse him this right violated his constitutional guarantees was wholly untenable. The court determined that the application of O.C.G.A. &sect; 58-1065 (1937-38) did not deny defendant any of his rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The insured had filed an action to recover payment under a hospital room expenses policy issued by the insurer for expenses incurred when the insured was confined in a state hospital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An insured held an insurance policy issued by an insurer, which agreed to pay a certain amount of daily hospital room expense, not to exceed in the aggregate 100 days on account of any one accident or disease, actually incurred. The insured was confined to a state hospital, which was a state institution within 1960 Ga. Laws pp. 1138-1143 providing a formulae whereby the amounts charged persons confined in such institutions could be computed, based upon ability to pay, for 114 days, and filed a notice of claim. The insurer declined to pay, and the insured then filed an action seeking payment for the hospital room expenses incurred. On appeal from a judgment for the insured, the court held that: (1) the insurer lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute because its enforcement did not infringe upon the insurer's right; (2) the insurer's obligation to pay depended upon the insured's duty to furnish proof of loss allowable under the policy; and (3) proof of expenses incurred for treatment, which was not covered under the policy, without a showing that it was attributable to charges for covered expenses, did not constitute proof of the amount recoverable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, City of Albany and certain citizens, sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Dougherty County (Georgia), which held that O.C.G.A. &sect; 58-1083 did not permit the City, upon its own initiative or pursuant to petition, hold a second referendum until two years after a prior referendum governing the sale of liquor by the drink (mixed drinks sale). Appellee citizens also sought review of the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City proposed a referendum pursuant to &sect; 58-1083. Appellees filed an action to enjoin the election, arguing that the statute did not permit a second election where a prior election had resulted in a vote against mixed drinks sales. Appellants denied the allegations and sought a declaratory judgment on their counterclaim that the statute and the referendum were valid. The trial court held that the statute was constitutional, that under the statute the City could not, on its own initiative or upon petition, hold a second referendum until two years after a prior referendum, and enjoined the City from conducting the proposed referendum until two years after the prior referendum. All parties sought review. The court reversed the judgment with respect to appellees' cross appeal, noting that &sect; 58-1083 twice mentioned that where a referendum vote was against the sale of mixed drinks, the referendum provision would become null, void, and of no force and effect. The court noted further that the statute provided for a subsequent election where a prior election was in favor of the sale of mixed drinks, but was silent as to a second election where the first vote was against such sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court on the grounds asserted in appellee's cross appeal and held that its decision on the cross appeal controlled adversely appellants' enumerations of error on the main appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant petitioned for writ of habeas corpus from the Tattnall Superior Court (Georgia) judgment remanding him to the custody of respondent warden after he was convicted of rape and sentenced to death. He alleged that the conviction and sentence were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant complained that his conviction and sentence violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution because the grand jury indicting him and the traverse jury which convicted him were illegal since they systematically excluded &quot;Negroes, women, and persons of limited economic means.&quot; He argued that selecting juries from racially segregated tax rolls was inherently discriminatory and resulted in persons of lower incomes being grossly underrepresented. He also complained that his death sentence was because the traverse jury had been purged of those opposed to capital punishment, so it failed to recommend mercy, and that it was cruel and arbitrary to punish a white man by death for rape. The fact that the death sentence for rape had been imposed on fewer white men than others in past years did not show a denial of due process or equal protection. Errors which had already been decided could not be raised on habeas corpus. Appellant lacked standing to question the constitutionality of O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-301. The court affirmed the rape conviction, but it agreed that, under Witherspoon, the death sentence was illegal and reversed it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of conviction for rape was affirmed, but the sentence imposed on the verdict was reversed as illegal and the case was remanded with directions to the trial court to impanel a capital jury and submit to it the question of whether defendant should have been recommended for mercy and sentenced accordingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Georgia Department of Agriculture (department) appealed an order of the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), which found that plaintiff corporation's imitation milk product did not come within the prohibition of the &quot;filled milk&quot; rule, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 42-511(1929) and Ga. Law p. 501 et seq. (1961). The trial court enjoined the department from preventing the corporation's sale of the product.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation's imitation milk product contained water, vegetable oil, dry milk solids, organic chemicals, and other ingredients. The corporation planned to label the cartons that it was not a dairy product and sought to enjoin the department from enforcing the &quot;filled milk&quot; rule against it. On appeal, the court affirmed. The product did not contain any condensed milk, evaporated milk, concentrated milk, or evaporated skimmed milk, sweetened or unsweetened, or any of their fluid derivatives. Therefore, it did not come within the prohibitions of the agency's enabling legislation, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 42-511. The evidence did not reveal that non-fat dry milk solids, which was the only milk contained in the product, was the same thing as one or more of the kinds of milk set forth in &sect; 42-511. The court rejected the department's assertion that marketing of the product in any container would be deceptive to the public because of its resemblance to milk. The rule did not authorize the department to do more than define standards for milk products and to approve labels for containers. The department could regulate packaging, labeling and branding of the product.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the injunction against the department's prohibiting the corporation from manufacture, distribution, and sale of its product in Georgia. The court modified the judgment to allow the department to make and enforce rules and regulations on the packaging, labeling and branding of the product and the marketing thereof so as to prevent deception of purchasers as to the true nature of the product.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Fulton County (Georgia), which convicted her in a jury trial of shoplifting in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2640; 1957 Ga. Laws 115. Defendant's motion for new trial was overruled. She claimed that the trial court erred by refusing to declare the statute defining shoplifting unconstitutional, in overruling her motion for new trial, and by failing to give a charge to the jury on intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested by store employees for shoplifting dresses. Defendant gave a fictitious name until she was identified. Defendant's first argument on appeal was that the shoplifting statute, O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2640; 1957 Ga. Laws 115, was too vague and indefinite to be enforceable and that it offended the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution as well as Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. III; O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-103. The court disagreed, holding that the language of the statute clearly spelled out what acts amounted to shoplifting and was thus amply definite and certain. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the trial court should have granted her a new trial because the evidence showed that she had no intent to deprive the owner of possession of the dresses. The court found the evidence sufficient to authorize the conviction. Finally, the jury instructions relating to the requisite intent to convict for violating the shoplifting statute adequately covered the issue by defining intent as an element of the offense, and by instructing that the State had the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's shoplifting conviction.</SPAN></P>

The company owner used the fictitious account in furtherance of his scheme. The corporation filed suit against the bank, alleging that it had knowledge of the fictitious account and of the company's owner's fraudulent conduct, that it participated in the fraud, and that it was therefore liable to the corporation for the misappropriated funds. The trial court granted summary judgment to the bank.

In the presence of his counsel, defendant admitted to the crime and returned to the crime seen with the sheriff. Defendant based his appeal on numerous grounds, but the court rejected all the proposed errors and affirmed the conviction. The court held in part that: (1) defendant was not denied the right to thorough and sifting cross examination of witnesses; (2) the trial court properly admitted photographs that were authenticated by the photographer and were stated by other witnesses to accurately represent the subject matter; (3) there was undisputed evidence that defendant's Miranda safeguards were provided; (4) defendant had no say in who served as bailiff during the course of the proceedings; and (5) the fact that the trial court, rather than counsel, polled the jurors following the verdict was not error.</SPAN></P>

They prayed that the 1967 tax digest as approved by the Commissioner be declared null and void and that he be enjoined from arbitrarily increasing the valuations and that the other taxing officials be required to uniformly assess the property for the years 1967 and 1968 and from otherwise assessing and collecting taxes under the alleged illegal digest for the year 1967.</SPAN></P>

The rogue and vagabond statute, O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-7101, did not violate the due process clause of the United States Constitution because it clearly required two elements for a conviction: (1) being found in or upon certain described buildings, and (2) with intent to steal any goods or chattels.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case involves the constitutionality of an ordinance of the City of Atlanta levying and assessing license fees upon occupations and businesses therein for 1968 and thereafter, based upon (1) taxable gross revenue, whether received or accrued, during the period of one calendar year, and (2) the total number of employees during the third quarter of the calendar year.  The ordinance was amended after the filing of the equitable action, apparently, to meet certain of the complaints in the petition which was then amended to attack other portions of the amended ordinance in named particulars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A restraining order previously granted was dissolved, and the court, after hearing argument, struck certain paragraphs of the petition on the ground that the attacks thereon were now moot because of the amendment to the ordinance, sustained the motion to dismiss, and dismissed the entire complaint.  The appeal is from this final judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original attacks were based primarily on the fact that gross receipts for the previous year were required for some taxpayers and for the current year for others; and the number of employees&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of some taxpayers was determined from the third quarter of the previous year and for others for a certain quarter in the current year.  After the ordinance was amended, the petitioner attacked the fee schedules based on (a) the volume of business in the various classifications; and (b) the number of employees -- both of which determined fixed fees to be charged all the various businesses coming within the subclassifications -- as well as the appropriate parts of the ordinance to which these tables referred as being invalid because they are unreasonable, arbitrary, discriminatory and capricious and violative of Art. VII, Sec. I, Par. III (uniformity); Art. I, Sec. I, Par. III (due process); Art. I, Sec. I, Par. II (equal protection) of the Georgia Constitution (Const. of 1945; Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2-5403, 2-103, 2-102), and the 14th Amendment of the Federal Constitution (Code &sect; 1-815) in that all businesses in a particular class are not taxed uniformly; and an additional attack upon the discriminatory nature of the ordinance in taxing those persons with rentals for real estate exceeding $ 8,000 taxable gross revenue and no tax on those persons whose rentals are less than that sum in taxable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  gross revenue.  </SPAN></P>

The taxpayer alleged the ordinance violated the Georgia Constitution of 1945, O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 2-5403, 2-103, 2-102, with regard to uniformity, due process, and equal protection and U.S. Const. amend. XIV with regard to uniformity. On appeal, the court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional because its classifications were discriminatory and not related to the law's purpose, which was to generate income based upon an entity's ability to pay and the burdens upon the city to furnish facilities and protection to the entity. The court specifically rejected classifications that exempted those entities receiving less than a certain amount in rental revenue from taxation, which charged a smaller license fee to manufacturers than to non-manufacturers that had identical numbers of employees and gross receipts. and which charged a license fee that jumped by $ 4,000 when one additional employee was added.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The obscene material was seized when officers searched defendant's residence pursuant to a search warrant for bookmaking records. The trial court held that the evidence was not to be suppressed, and the court agreed and affirmed the conviction. Police officers in the process of conducting a lawful search were permitted to seize any contraband that would be tangible evidence of the commission of a crime. The court held that defendant's indictment sufficiently charged him with a crime, as it was not essential to charge that he possessed the obscene material with the intent to sell or circulate the material.  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-6301 was not unconstitutional in its enactment, and &sect; 26-6301 was not in conflict with the freedom of press as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Section 26-6301 required reasonable knowledge on defendant's part as to his knowledge that the material was obscene, and such knowledge could be proven solely by circumstantial evidence. The prosecution was not required to prove that defendant knew the community standards for obscenity, nor was there a requirement that the materials in question had to have been previously found to be obscene by a court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the city's weight ordinance was declared unconstitutional, defendants, mayor and general council, enacted a new ordinance and declared their intention to arrest and any driver who violated it. The owner sought injunctive relief and argued he complied with Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 68-405(c)(i) by not exceeding the gross weight limit. After granting interlocutory injunctive relief, the trial court ordered that the owner post a bond, and subsequently dismissed the action. The court held that the state weight limits were not intended to withdraw from the city the street regulatory charter power granted to it or upon all municipalities by a subsequent act. Under that power the city was authorized to require trucks of certain weights to travel upon designated streets only. There was thus no conflict between the ordinance and the general law. However, the court reversed because the owner alleged that the permitted streets were wholly inadequate for use by the trucks without great danger to the drivers, the trucks, residents, and traffic. Because the owner was entitled to prove the allegations, dismissal was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs sought to have the land re-zoned in light of its proximity to commercial, religious, and educational developments. However, the board denied their applications for the same. The building inspectors also denied plaintiffs' application for a certificate of zoning compliance and a permit to construct the shopping center. Plaintiffs filed an action against defendants, but the trial court dismissed their petition. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and held that plaintiffs' petition stated a claim upon which relief could be granted. It alleged why the property was not desirable for any of the permitted uses by the existing zoning ordinance and why it was unreasonable and arbitrary as applied to the land. Further, it alleged that the existing zoning ordinance as applied to the land was unconstitutional and arbitrary because it prohibited the use of the land for the only use for which it was reasonably and economically suited, which had the effect of completely destroying plaintiffs' property rights without the payment of just compensation.</SPAN></P>

The inmate contended that she had chronic alcoholism, a disease, at the time of her escape and thus was not guilty of a crime. The court reversed the judgment. The court observed that the inmate's contention that the municipal court sentence was void was without substance and that where one was confined by lawful authority it was his duty to submit until delivered by due process of law. The court noted that as to drunkenness or intoxication, which, depriving men of their reason, put them in a temporary frenzy, the law looked upon it as an aggravation of the offense, rather than an excuse for any criminal misbehavior. The court stated that although the argument that the inmate being a chronic alcoholic, it would amount to cruel and unusual punishment to punish her for violating the law, and that she should not be crucified on a cross of public indifference to her condition, might arouse moral sympathy, it should not control or influence the court's judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state legislature submitted a constitutional amendment to the voters that ratified a system under which a city maintained an independent school system for which an annual ad valorem tax was levied, the city's county had a separate school system for other residents, and city children could not attend the county school system without paying a fee. The voters approved the amendment. Decades later, the taxpayers brought an action against the officials alleging that the amendment violated the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The trial court entered a judgment denying the taxpayers' petition for a temporary injunction and overruling the officials' general demurrer. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that (1) the ballot on which the amendment was voted did not violate Ga. Const. art. XIII (1877), which left details concerning submission of amendments to the legislature; and (2) the amendment's classification based on population was not unconstitutional because it had a rational basis reflecting the financial and taxable wealth disparity between the city and county systems.</SPAN></P>

The company sought legal expenses as a part of the damages.

The trial court overruled the carrier's demurrers. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the interstate commerce clause did not prevent states from legislating local concerns, even though such legislation indirectly or incidentally affected interstate commerce. The company's action was not one to recover compensation as the carrier's employee, but was to indemnify the company for a monetary loss caused by the carrier's tortious act to the company's employee. Subrogation was a matter of equity, without regard to any agreement made with the person paying the debt.

The court further found that while a superior-court chartered corporation could not operate a private bank it could purchase and sell the same, and that there could be no limitation on the original owner's right to dispose of the bank, nor could there be any limitation upon the superior-court chartered corporation's right to dispose of it after purchasing the same from the original owner.

On appeal the court affirmed the injunction and held &sect; 42-523 et seq. violated the Due Process Clause of the Georgia Constitution. Because a previous decision, which ruled that that &sect; 42-523 et seq. was unconstitutional, was made by the court in a full bench decision, the court noted that it could only be reversed if the seven justices had agreed, or if there had been some material amendment or facts that would have made the question of law in the commission's action different from the prior decision. The court determined that seven justices were not willing to overrule the prior decision, so it controlled the outcome of the action. The court noted that the legislature could have authorized price fixing without violating the Due Process Clause of the Georgia Constitution only if the milk industry was affected with the public interest. Because it was not, the court ruled that the scheme was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Conceding, but not deciding, that the foundation had named proper parties defendant against whom it might, in an appropriate action, have relief, the court found that the petition failed to set forth a cause of action for any of the relief prayed for. The court further found that until the foundation could show either that the statute in question had been invoked against it, or that there was a direct threat by the authorities to invoke it, it had no standing to come into court and have the court declare the statute invalid. Because the only basis upon which the foundation contended it was entitled to have its rights declared was upon its contention that the statute was unconstitutional, the court concluded that the foundation was not entitled to any of the substantial relief prayed for in its petition, and that the trial court did not err in sustaining the general demurrer and in dismissing it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal from a murder conviction and sentence without a recommendation for mercy, and is the second appearance in this court, the first trial having been held to be null and void.  See Manor v. State, 221 Ga. 866, supra.  Many of the facts are the same and reference is made to the above report for a complete study of the case.  However, the accused was reindicted, and the present case is entirely different.  A resume of the evidence is hereinafter set out.  The accused allegedly broke and entered the dwelling of the deceased where his fingerprints were found and identified.  She was found dead in a bathtub shortly after the burglary, having died by reason of drowning, and had multiple cuts and bruises on the face and neck with a fracture of the thyroid cartilage of the neck allegedly caused by pressure.  The unsworn statement of the accused made at the former trial was read into the record in which he admitted he had gone to her home to take certain items, she surprised him, he &quot;grabbed&quot; her, but did not intend to kill her, that she came in and found him, that he got frightened, pushed her aside to get out of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  way, that &quot;maybe she fainted or maybe he knocked her too hard, but I put her in the bathtub and got scared and run,&quot; and he put her in the bathtub to talk to her and ask her forgiveness.  He made no statement and offered no evidence during this trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant, after conviction, filed a motion for new trial which was subsequently amended to add 37 additional special grounds.  The enumerated errors complain of the overruling of the motion for new trial, as amended, and list 40 alleged errors both in the overruling of the motion and occurring during the trial.  Because of the quantity of the alleged errors they will not be set out since they are considered in the various headnotes which reflect the grounds argued in appellant's brief.  </SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred when it admitted certain evidence. The court held that: (1) reference to other crimes not shown to be connected with the one on trial, reference to an FBI record, and references in a letter that served no relevant purpose squarely put defendant's character as a claimed criminal, even without proof of conviction, into evidence; (2) the references were highly prejudicial and harmful to defendant; (3) the trial court erred when it allowed the matter in question into evidence and when it allowed it to go out to the jury room with the jury; and (4) the errors required the grant of a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant democratic party officials sought review of an order by the Superior Court of Bibb County (Georgia) in favor of plaintiff city electors. The electors sought a mandamus against requiring the officials to qualify plaintiff incumbent city mayor as a mayoral candidate and sought a determination of the validity of 1967 Ga. Laws 2180, &sect; 12 (c). The mayor's candidacy was rejected because it was contended that he could not succeed himself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court stated that the title of the 1967 Act amending the city charter, 1967 Ga. Laws 2180, in addition to dealing with the election of the mayor and aldermen, dealt with other matters affecting the city government. Under the charter prior to the 1967 amendment, a mayor was ineligible to succeed himself. Under the 1967 Act amending the charter, the mayor was eligible to succeed himself for one term. The body of the 1967 Act repealed the provisions of the charter making the mayor ineligible to succeed himself. Section 12 (c) contained matter different from that contained in the title of the Act and violated the Georgia Constitution. The title of the Act declared the intent and purpose of the Act was to make the mayor eligible to succeed himself for one term. Section 12 (b) expressly carried out that purpose, but &sect; 12 (c) denied the right of the present mayor to succeed himself for one term. To remove &sect; 12 (c) from the Act left &sect; 12 (b) unaffected. Section 12 (b) did not re-enact the prohibition against a second successive term. The 1967 Act removed the prohibition by permitting a second successive term. The trial court did not err in granting mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">From two adverse judgments filed against him, appellant filed an action in the Court of Appeals of Georgia. Appellant sought review, by writ of certiorari, from a judgment of the Court of Appeals of Georgia, which dismissed the appeals because the transcript was not filed in the trial court within 30 days after filing of the notice of appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals noted that appellant's counsel timely presented an order for an extension of time that the judge refused to sign.

Had counsel relied upon his original application and assert his right to have the judge grant an extension under the mandatory provisions of the last sentence of &sect; 11 of the Appellate Practice Act, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 6-806, he had his remedy by mandamus to secure judicial review of the judge's ruling that the mandatory feature of the Act was unconstitutional. Counsel did not pursue that remedy, but abandoned his timely application, and sought to pursue an untimely one. The appeals court determined that it had no discretion and that it had to declare the applicable law and dismiss the appeal. The court deemed the dismissal erroneous. The court held that appellant, having complied with the requirements of the Act for obtaining an extension of time for filing of the transcript and thus, having done all he could do toward obtaining it, was entitled to an extension as originally applied for.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was one several people who picketed an Army building in opposition to the Viet Nam war.

Defendant was subsequently convicted for assault and battery and the use of opprobrious words or abusive language, pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-6303. The trial court overruled his demurrers to the indictment and post trial motions. On appeal, the court affirmed. It held that &sect; 26-6303 was not so vague, indefinite, or uncertain as to be unconstitutional. Furthermore, it was not necessary for the indictment to specify how the opprobrious words tended to cause a breach of the peace. The assault and language counts charged different offenses and there was no error in the denial of the motion for arrest of judgment on due process and equal protection grounds. Finally, the motion for new trial was properly denied because the evidence was sufficient to warrant conviction. The court also noted that a misnomer in the indictment was immaterial and a relevant malicious mischief charge was appropriately limited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder and his conviction was affirmed. Defendant's application for a writ of habeas corpus was based on the allegation that prospective jurors were asked on voir dire examination if they conscientiously opposed capital punishment. Defendant did not object to the composition of the jury until after his verdict was rendered. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment. The court stated that defendant's objection to the qualification of the jury as to persons with conscientious objections to capital punishment was waived because he did not object until after the verdict was rendered. The court determined that, if the attack had been timely, such challenge would not have been meritorious because certain testimony would have established that the jurors, who had conscientious scruples against capital punishment, were not impartial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens and taxpayers asserted that the government officials were preparing to expend large amounts of money regarding the annexation of property but that the expenditures would be illegal because the provisions as to the notice of the holding of the election were not complied with as set forth in 1953 Ga. Laws 2610, &sect; 4. The citizens and taxpayers argued that the election was void because notice of the election was not given at least 30 days before the election in each of the daily newspapers, as required. Proper notice was published in one newspaper but was not published in a second newspaper at least 30 days before the election. The court held that it was error to have denied the request for an injunction because the failure to give the 30 day notice in both the daily newspapers rendered the election void. An injunction was an available and appropriate remedy. In their cross appeal the government officials contended that the allegations in the petition were too vague and indefinite regarding the citizenship of the citizens and taxpayers. The court disagreed and concluded that all of the named citizens and taxpayers were either taxpayers or citizens of the city or county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's denial of an injunction and affirmed the trial court's judgment that overruled the special demurrer filed by the government officials.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is fully reported in Whitehead v. Henson, 115 Ga. App. 81 (153 SE2d 581). The writ of certiorari was granted to review the decision of the Court of Appeals holding that the tax assessors might use part of the findings of the arbitrators as to market value and reject other alleged unauthorized findings of the assessment, and assess property based on the fair market value rather than to use the assessment arrived at by a majority of the arbitrators in conformity with Code Ann. &sect; 92-6912.  The court then held a petition by the taxpayer alleging that the tax assessors refused to follow the findings of the majority of the arbitrators as to the assessment did not allege a cause of action, it not being alleged therein that the assessment of the arbitrators was fair, just or equalized.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the taxpayer's petition alleged that the assessment of the majority of the arbitrators had been ignored by the taxing authorities who were proceeding to attempt to collect taxes on a basis other than the arbitrators' assessment, and that it prayed to have their action adjudged illegal and to enjoin further action. The court held that had the arbitrators ignored the established policy and custom and made their assessment at full value, that would have contradicted their oaths to assess according to law, justice and equity. As related to tax law, the court found that the assessment was the amount on which the taxpayer pays taxes. The court further found that to collect taxes on any other basis than the arbitrators' assessment would be contrary to law and that no official except the Revenue Commissioner could be allowed to tamper with or alter that assessment. The court concluded that the petition alleged a cause of action, and that the lower court erred in affirming the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner property owner brought suit in the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia) alleging wanton negligence by defendants, county, the State Highway Department (department), and its contractors, and creation of a nuisance, and simple negligence. The property owner requested injunctive relief against the city to prohibit prosecution for safety violations. The trial court sustained the general demurrers and the property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Reversing the sustaining of the county's and department's demurrers, the court explained that the allegations of negligent construction were sufficient to give rise to a cause of action for damages to property under the eminent domain provision of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; III, para. I, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-301, sometimes called an &quot;inverse condemnation&quot; proceeding. Private property must have been negligently taken or damaged for a public purpose in order for the action to prevail against the defense that recovery was barred by a previous condemnation award. However, the court ruled that the trial court properly sustained the demurrer of the contractors, explaining that the claim was not authorized by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 95-1710, and that the four-year statute of limitation, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 3-1001, was applicable, making the claim untimely. The court added that the demurrer of the city was properly sustained because enforcement authorized by the building code was criminal, or at least quasi-criminal in nature, and could not have been restrained by an action in equity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment with regard to sustaining the demurrer of the contractors and reversed the judgment with regard to sustaining the demurrer of the county and department in the suit the property owner brought alleging an inverse condemnation. The court affirmed the sustaining of the city's demurrer with regard to the property owner's request that the trial court forbid the city from enforcing its building code.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present action arose as a result of the enactment of the Act of 1966 (Ga. L. 1966, p. 517), providing for the collection of ad valorem taxes on motor vehicles at the time license plates are purchased rather than at the time ad valorem taxes are paid on other tangible property.  The plaintiffs allege that the Act violates various provisions of the Constitution and is being interpreted and enforced contrary to provisions of the Act.  Demurrers of the State Revenue Commissioner and of the Tax Commissioner of Laurens County were overruled and it is to such judgment adverse to them that they now appeal.  </SPAN></P>

Laws 517 was unconstitutional and that defendants were interpreting and enforcing it in an unlawful manner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs petitioned for declaratory relief, claiming that defendants were interpreting and enforcing 1966 Ga. Laws 517, related to the ad valorem taxation of automobiles, in an improper and unfair manner and that the Act was constitutionally infirm. The trial court overruled defendants' demurrers to the petition. The court reversed, concluding that plaintiffs' petition failed to set forth a cause of action for declaratory relief. The court found that no constitutional violation was shown by plaintiffs' allegations that the motor vehicles in their inventory were assessed differently than the inventory of other merchants. Further, the court found that the fact that the caption or title to the Act did not expressly state or refer to the penalty provided for in &sect; 4 thereof did not contravene the constitutional provision against having more than one subject matter in an act or having different subject matter from that expressed in the caption. The court also found that the plaintiffs' claim regarding defendants' enforcement of the Act did not present a justiciable controversy and that their claim of unconstitutional application of the Act was without merit.</SPAN></P>

The warden maintained that the inmate was in his custody by virtue of his death sentence. The court held that O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-1005 was not unconstitutional or void because it did not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, nor was he denied his due process rights under the statute. The court held that under O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-1005, the jury was entitled to recommend life in prison due to the nature of the crime committed by the inmate. The court noted that the inmate had been afforded a trial in a court of justice, before his peers and had not been treated any differently than any other inmate. Further, the court found that &sect; 26-1005 provided no standard to guide the jury in determining the penalty recommended by it to the trial court and did not give the jury the benefit of an investigation regarding the incident.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that opinions could differ as to whether abstaining from labor on Sunday was a religious duty; but that it was certain that the legislature of Georgia prescribed it as a civil duty. The court ruled that &sect; 26-9605 could be fairly and rationally be treated as a legitimate police regulation and was thus valid. The court reasoned that the fact that a determination must be made in each case as to whether the act charged as violating &sect; 26-6905 was a work of necessity or charity did not make &sect; 26-6905 or the accusation drawn under it, so vague, indefinite, and uncertain as to render it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were involved in a &quot;freedom march&quot; and a crowd had gathered at the county courthouse. Defendants moved over to the flagpole and proceeded to lower the flags. One defendant stated that the African-American community was in a state of mourning and he intended to lower the flag to half-mast to symbolize the state of mourning. As the flag was being lowered, others in the group closed in, removed the flags from the lanyard, actually tearing the American flag and damaging the State's flag. They were convicted of damaging the flags, and they appealed. The court rejected defendants' argument that the jury was unfairly drawn because the court determined that the jury represented a proper make-up of the community. The court also found that &sect;&sect; 26-702, 86-1210 were not so vague and uncertain as to be unconstitutional. Moreover, the court held that the trial court's action in directing the jury to return to the jury room and arrive at a unanimous verdict if possible was not error because the poll of the jury disclosed that its verdict was not unanimous. Finally, the court concluded that the evidence authorized the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A certiorari writ was granted in this case of condemnation to review the Court of Appeals in its decision reported in State Hwy. Dept. v. Calhoun, 114 Ga. App. 501 (151 SE2d 806), where it was held that the lower court erred in refusing to grant a motion for new trial complaining that the court erred in charging the jury that it should look to all circumstances affecting the value of land taken at the time of taking including enhancement resulting from knowledge of the impending taking.  The applicant alleges error in that the trial court correctly charged the law and the Court of Appeals should not have reversed because (1) the appellant failed to raise that question in the lower court in conformity with Code Ann. &sect; 70-207 (a) (Ga. L. 1965, pp. 18, 31, as amended); (2) the 1966 Act defining just and adequate compensation (Ga. L. 1966, p. 320), which allegedly changed the method of determining value of property taken, which specifically denies consideration of enhancement resulting from knowledge of the impending taking, deprived the appellee of vested rights&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and therefore should not have been applied since it was adopted as law after the trial of the case; (3) its application by the Court of Appeals was in violation of constitutional guarantees specifically provided by the Georgia Constitution; and (4) the 1966 Act, supra, is otherwise unconstitutional.  Because of the apparent confusing state of the law as to what rule of the law the Court of Appeals should have applied, this court granted certiorari.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that Ga. Const. of 1945, art. I, &sect; 3, para.

The trial court refused to grant the voters an injunction and dismissed their petition. The voters appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly denied injunctive relief. The court reasoned that Ga. Const. art V reserved the power and right to the general assembly to elect a governor from the two persons having the highest number of votes where no person received a majority of the votes cast in the general election. Further, the runoff provision in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 34-1514 did not apply because the legislation had to defer to the conflicting provisions dealing with the election of a governor in Ga.

The trial court overruled the special pleas. The court affirmed the ruling and held that &sect; 68-810 was not subject to the constitutional attacks made upon it. The legislature provided that, in the exercise of police power in regulating state highways, service was made upon the personal representative of a nonresident motorist who had died and who was the subject of an action. When the nonresident motorist drove on the state's highways, he subjected himself to the court's jurisdiction and consented to bind his legal representative in an action arising out of any accident. The statute was narrowly drawn, provided for due process, and applied only to actions arising in Georgia. The fact that the survivor failed to file notice of her claim against the estate of the nonresident motorist with the foreign state was not a bar or a defense to the action.</SPAN></P>

The court held that neither the plea nor the ground of demurrer specified any constitutional provision as the one defendant contended was being violated. The court also held that a demurrer could attack only those defects which appeared on the face of the indictment and that where a demurrer sought to add extrinsic matter, it failed as a speaking demurrer.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation, a corporation engaged in the business of writing title insurance, filed an action for declaratory judgment against the Georgia Bar Association, alleging that the association is contending that the petitioner is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law with respect to certain of its activities, and the association has sent the petitioner a copy of a resolution formulated by the Board of Governors of the Georgia Bar Association, which directed the executive secretary of the association to write a letter to each title insurance company doing business in Georgia requesting it to cease specified activities which the Committee on Unauthorized Practice of Law of the association deems to constitute the unlawful practice of law, and threatening to bring an action to restrain the practices specified unless it agrees to cease such practices.  The petitioner asserted that its activities which the association claims constitute the unlawful practice of law are not violative of the applicable statutes of the State of Georgia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Georgia Bar Association by demurrer attacked the provisions of the Act of 1931 (Ga. L. 1931, pp. 191-194), codified as &sect;&sect; 9-401 through 9-405, as amended by Ga. L. 1937, pp. 753-754, as being violative of stated provisions of the Constitution.  It filed an answer in which it asserted the unconstitutionality of these statutes, and a cross action which specified the particulars in which it claimed that the petitioner is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.  It prayed that the justiciable issue between the parties be decided, and that the petitioner be permanently restrained from the acts enumerated.  The trial judge upheld the validity of Chapter 9-4 of the Code, as amended by Ga. L. 1937, pp. 753-754.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pre-trial order approved the stipulation of the parties that the issue in the case remaining for decision was &quot;whether or not the evidence shows any activity of the plaintiff, as alleged in the pleadings, if proven, is a violation of the Georgia statutes defining the practice of law as those statutes may have been construed by the Appellate Courts of Georgia.&quot;</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court correctly determined the issues of law and fact. In reaching its decision, the court agreed with the trial court that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-403 allowed the title insurance corporation to examine records, issue abstracts of title, certify to the correctness of them, issue policies of insurance on titles to real or personal property, and receive payment for those services. The court also agreed with the trial court that the title insurance corporation violated state law when it held itself out to the public as being authorized to render legal services and advice in the handling and closing of real estate transactions between title insurance applicants and third persons, advertising that the employment of an attorney was not necessary, and advertising that the fees and charges for its services were the same as those charged by attorneys.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandamus.  Fulton Superior Court.  Before Judge Moore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While three appeals were filed by the separate appellants, all three are the same, and these appellants comprise the State school officials, and the local school officials of Fulton and DeKalb Counties, all named as defendants in this mandamus action brought by the school officials of the City of Atlanta, an independent school system, in their official capacities and as citizens and taxpayers.  The petitioners seek to prevent the state officials in the administration of the Minimum Foundation Program of Education Act (Ga. L. 1964, pp. 3, 49; Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 32-601 to 32-657) from giving effect to a proviso therein which has the effect of reducing the allotment of state school funds to all municipal or independent school systems, including the Atlanta system, from the amounts which such systems could receive if the proviso were to be ignored or held unconstitutional.  The petition, as amended, in count 1, seeks to have the proviso declared unconstitutional for a number of reasons; and, in count 2, to have the court make the state officials ignore it in determining the school funds for the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Atlanta school system.  Inasmuch as, under the law, an increased allotment of state school funds for Atlanta would come at the expense of the county school systems of DeKalb and Fulton, these local school officials were named also as defendants.  Under the minimum foundation program, local school systems -- area, independent and county -- are required to furnish, according to a formula, local funds to support the program of education.  The proviso mentioned above requires all independent school systems in a county to be calculated on a percentage greater than 100% which, in effect, causes all such systems to produce more local funds and thereby reduces the amount of state funds the system would receive.  The Atlanta system seeks to be considered without reference to the proviso applying to independent school systems because it is in more than one county, and this proviso which requires an increased financial ability to pay, that is, increased local funds with decreased state participation, is not applicable because it is, in the language of the statute, not &quot;located within a county&quot; but rather is located in two counties, and that the state officials be required to calculate its financial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ability to pay by the proviso applying to all local units of administration without applying the special proviso required of independent school systems within a county.  Demurrers were filed, and after a hearing, the court refused to rule on the constitutional attack but overruled the demurrers to count 2 and ordered the state officials to calculate the Atlanta system's financial ability to pay according to the Act without giving effect to the proviso applying to independent school systems.  The appeal is from this final judgment overruling the general demurrers to count 2 and granting the mandamus absolute.  </SPAN></P>

The main issue was whether there was a rational basis for classifying local units of school administration differently so as to create disparity of fiscal treatment that imposed on independent school systems the requirement to pay a greater share of the costs imposed by the Act than was imposed on other local units of school administration. The court held that: (1) the Georgia constitution classified independent and county school systems separately; (2) there was a reasonable basis for such classification; (3) the classification was not offensive although it was made without mathematical nicety and might have resulted in some inequality; (4) the city board's complaint should be directed to the legislature; and (5) prior case law determined that &sect; 22B of the Act was applicable even though the city board's jurisdiction fell within two separate counties.</SPAN></P>

The amendment permitted the issuance of revenue bonds for a purely private purpose by exempting certain private industry from ad valorem taxes for constructing new buildings or plants, even if the industry already had such buildings or plants in the county. Therefore, the amendment did not provide for the public purpose of promotion and development of new industry. Such differentiation in taxation constituted a taking of the property of the taxpayers and other private industries that were not exempt from such taxes without due process of law. It also denied the taxpayers equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer asserted that it was entitled to maintain the action as a &quot;taxpayer&quot; by virtue of the two statutory refund provisions, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 92-3434(a); Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 92-8436(b), which the taxpayer pleaded as the jurisdictional bases for the action. The court stated that the statutory authority to sue for a refund did not provide the standing to attack the constitutionality of a statute where the facts alleged showed no injury from enforcement of such statute. The court found that the taxpayer itself used the property to make its rooms livable and rentable to guests. The fact that a part of the charge for the rooms was allegedly attributable to such property did not cause such use of it to be a resale. Although the taxpayer's guests also used the property while occupying the rooms, the guests used the property as a part of the rooms, which they rented. Not many of them would have cared to use the rooms without any of the items such as carpeting and furniture. The taxpayer's allegations did not show that the taxpayer's purchase of the personal property was for the purpose of resale. Thus, the court affirmed the judgment sustaining the commissioner's general demurrers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a suit seeking to enjoin an alleged collusive agreement between a tortfeasor and the injured party who received certain workmen's compensation payments from the plaintiff for an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment which will have the alleged effect of voiding the legal liability of the tortfeasor to pay damages to the injured person who received the workmen's compensation benefits from the plaintiff.  The petitioner likewise prayed for a money judgment.  The brief history of the statute under which this suit is allegedly brought is as follows: In 1937 the General Assembly amended a number of sections of the Workmen's Compensation Law.  One of the amended sections was Code &sect; 114-403, the legislature striking the words &quot;under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person,&quot; in the second line thereof and substituting in lieu thereof the words, &quot;under circumstances whereby payment is made by some person.&quot; Ga. L. 1937, p. 528.  In Lloyd Adams, Inc. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 190 Ga. 633 (10 SE2d 46), this language declaring that an injured employee may maintain a suit against a tortfeasor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  after having accepted payment from him for damages sustained was held to be a legal absurdity, unconstitutional, null and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present suit is predicated upon the clearly stricken words &quot;under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person,&quot; the insurance carrier of the employer seeking the right of subrogation under Code &sect; 114-403 before the 1937 amendment.  General demurrers were sustained to the petition, and the appeal is to the judgment dismissing the petition.  </SPAN></P>

The lower court sustained the general demurrers of the injured person and tortfeasor and dismissed the suit. The court affirmed the dismissal because it found that O.C.G.A. &sect; 114-403 provided no subrogation rights to the insurer at all. The insurer for the injured person's employer had no right to intervene, enjoin, or otherwise affect the suit by the injured person against the tortfeasor to prevent a settlement between them or to be subrogated to the claim of the injured person against the tortfeasor for the amount it had paid the injured person under the terms of its contract with the employer.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and held that at common law, prior to the first Constitution of Georgia, there was a duty imposed upon the father of a minor child to support it either during coverture or subsequent to a divorce of the parents. The court held that prior decisions constituted a ruling that the divorced mother could not bring a common law action against the father of the minor children. The Act for the support of the dependent children and others was wholly of statutory origin and unknown to the common or statutory law of England prior to the first Georgia Constitution, and therefore, in a proceeding under the Act, the father of the minor children was not entitled to a jury trial as a constitutional right.

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern Guaranty Insurance Company brought an action for declaratory judgment and injunction against James H. Nelson, Gerardo Otero, and Pacific Indemnity Company.  On July 7, 1963, the plaintiff issued a policy of automobile liability insurance to Gerardo Otero, for a term from July 7, 1963, to July 7, 1964, covering two automobiles, which policy contained an exclusion endorsement as follows: &quot;It is agreed that the insurance afforded by this policy shall not apply with respect to any claim arising from accidents which occur while any automobile is being operated by Ferdinand Otero, son, nor Gerardo A. Otero, Jr., son.&quot; On November 1, 1963, Gerardo A. Otero, Jr., was operating one of the automobiles covered by the policy, when he was involved in an accident with James H. Nelson, and a suit for damages was filed by Nelson against Gerardo A. Otero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff sought a declaration that it was not liable to provide any insurance coverage, or to defend any suit filed by Nelson, as a result of the accident on November 1, 1963.  Pacific Indemnity Company was named as a defendant because it is subrogated to the rights&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of James H. Nelson against Gerardo Otero to the extent of payments made by Pacific Indemnity Company to James H. Nelson, on behalf of Nelson's employer, as required by the Workmen's Compensation Law.  The plaintiff further sought a declaration that it is not bound to provide any insurance coverage or defense with respect to any lien or right of subrogation claimed by Pacific Indemnity Company.  Injunction was prayed to maintain the status until the question of the liability of the plaintiff could be adjudicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answers were filed, and amendments to the answers and to the petition.  The plaintiff and the defendant Nelson both filed motions for summary judgment.  The trial judge granted the motion for summary judgment of the plaintiff and denied that of the defendant Nelson.  In his judgment he declared that: The policy of insurance, including the endorsement, affords no coverage with respect to the automobile accident on November 1, 1963, and imposes no obligation upon the plaintiff to defend any suit arising out of this accident, and imposes no obligation upon the plaintiff to pay any damages that might be recovered by James H. Nelson or Pacific Indemnity Company.  Section 56-407A&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (c) of the Code (Ga. L. 1963, p. 588) is unconstitutional since it contains matter different from that expressed in the caption, in contravention of the Constitution, Art. III, Sec. VII, Par. VIII (Code Ann. &sect; 2-1908).  All of the defendants were permanently enjoined from taking any action against the plaintiff to collect any sum of money as damages for injuries arising out of the accident of November 1, 1963.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is reported in Holden v. CTC Finance Corp., 112 Ga. App. 443 (145 SE2d 597), and relates to the question of the right of a trial judge or court in the first grant of a new trial and an interpretation of Ga. L. 1959, pp. 353, 354, which seemingly restricts the court in granting same, the Court of Appeals holding that the matter of stating the ground, or grounds, upon which the first grant of a motion for new trial is granted is not discretionary but mandatory.  The applicant is before this court contending the decision is erroneous because it is in conflict with the power of superior courts to grant new trials under the constitutional mandate (Constitution of 1945; Code Ann. &sect; 2-123) and is an invasion of the judicial powers by the legislature under the separation of powers clause of the State Constitution (Constitution of 1945; Code Ann. &sect; 2-3906).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted a writ of certiorari to an applicant from the Court of Appeals (Georgia) to hear its appeal related to the rights of a court in the first grant of a new trial, and to interpret 1959 Ga. Laws 353, 354, which apparently restricted courts in granting new trials. The appellate court had held that the grounds upon which the first grant of a motion for new trial was granted were not discretionary but mandatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant argued that the appellate court's decision was erroneous because it was in conflict with the power of superior courts to grant new trials under Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; 4, para. 6, and was an invasion of the judicial powers by the legislature under the separation of powers clause of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, para. 23. The court noted that those constitutional clauses created insuperable barriers to any legislative control or interference with the courts in the exercise of their powers to grant new trials. The court reasoned that if 1959 Ga. Laws 353 was not construed as discretionary instead of mandatory, it could have nullified the unrestricted constitutional power of the courts regarding the grant of a new trial. Therefore, declaring the act discretionary, the court held that the lower courts could have complied with it if they wished, but a failure to do so was not error and was no grounds for reversing a judgment granting a new trial. In so reversing the appellate court, the court also pointed out that the entire 1959 Act was a nullity and was not subject to further consideration on remand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 2, 1965, the petitioners, E. S. Stinson, Jack Lewis and Elmer Dixon, filed their petition in the Laurens Superior Court against a plethora of named defendants, including the Secretary of State, the Ordinary of Laurens County, and various members of Boards of Education in that county, in which they sought injunctive relief, a declaration that a Constitutional Amendment purportedly adopted in 1964 was improperly ratified and praying that an Act of 1965 enacted pursuant to the Constitutional Amendment be declared unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations of the petition with which we shall be concerned in a decision of this case are as follows: that prior to November 3, 1964, there were in existence two school systems in Laurens County, to wit, the Laurens County School System (hereinafter referred to as the County System) and the Independent School System of Dublin (hereinafter referred to as the Independent System); that on November 3, 1964, an amendment (Ga. L. 1964, p. 903) proposing to merge the two systems into a Dublin Laurens County School System was submitted for ratification; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that such amendment was a local amendment required to be separately submitted to the electors of the two school systems and required to be approved by a majority of each of the two systems voting separately; that the Dublin Election District is larger in territory than the Independent System and comprises electors of both systems; that electors of the Dublin Election District were not separately voted, but at the election all votes cast in that election district were counted without regard to the school system to which they belonged; that within the Dublin Election District it was impossible to determine how many electors of the County System cast their votes for or against the proposal or how many of the electors of the Independent System voted for or against the proposal; that of the votes counted in the Dublin Election District there were several hundred electors, to wit, in excess of 500, who resided in the County System and whose votes were counted with and included in the totals of the electors residing in the Independent System; that it was impossible to tell if the votes of the several hundred electors of the County System had been counted with the other electors of such system&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and hence whether the amendment was ratified or rejected; that there were only 19 more votes for ratification than against ratification of the amendment in those areas of the County System where the electors voted separately (the county area outside the Dublin Election District); that relative to the ratification of the amendment there exists an insurmountable uncertainty incident to the method of submission and the counting of votes which would overcome the apparent and announced result of the &quot;referendum&quot;; that there were 493 absentee ballots which were counted and included without regard to the school district of which each absentee voter was an elector, the votes being added to the totals of the Dublin Election District; that of the absentee electors at least 100 were electors of the County System and their votes were not separately reflected or reflected with any other election district outside the Independent District; that a failure to have the votes properly counted would nullify the petitioner's votes against ratification and require a result different from that which would have appertained had the votes been properly counted; that as a result the amendment was not duly ratified. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The petition further alleged that in 1965 the General Assembly enacted into law an Act (Ga. L. 1965, p. 2023) purporting to implement the amendment; that pursuant to that Act an election was held for members of the Dublin Laurens County School Board and that certain defendants were elected; that the petitioners did not bring this petition prior to June 1965, because an action which sought to require a proper certification of the referendum on the amendment had been filed in January 1965, by other parties and this court rendered a decision on that case May 19, 1965; that this action was brought while a rehearing was pending before this court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition also alleged that the Election Code of 1964 (Ga. L. 1964, Ex. Sess., p. 26) is not an adequate remedy at law and is inapplicable, but if it is applicable it is unconstitutional and void; that the Act of 1965 (Ga. L. 1965, p. 2023) was unconstitutional and void in the absence of the adoption of the Constitutional amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants filed their demurrers to the petition as amended on the grounds: that no cause of action was set forth; that the petitioners failed to show any legal standing to bring the suit; that the petitioners&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  failed to avail themselves of the provisions of the Election Code of 1964, supra, to contest an election and that they had an adequate and complete remedy at law under that Act; that by virtue of their long delay in bringing the petition and allowing the State and local governments to proceed to implement the provisions of the amendment, the petitioners are guilty of such laches as to bar them from bringing the action.  The defendants also filed a special plea based on three grounds, to which plea the petitioners demurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a hearing on the demurrers to the petition, the trial judge entered an order in which he found that the petition showed, as a matter of law, that it did not set forth a cause of action for the reason that the Election Code governed, and since petitioners had not proceeded under that law they could not now bring this action.  The judge also ruled against the plaintiffs' contention that the Election Code was unconstitutional and ruled that the enabling Act was valid and that the petitioners were guilty of laches.  He also sustained the petitioners' demurrers to ground 1 of the defendants' plea, but overruled the demurrers as to grounds 2 and 3.  To the adverse&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rulings contained in the order, the plaintiffs except and bring the case to this court for review.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The First National Bank in Waycross filed its application in Charlton Superior Court seeking confirmation of a sale of real property under a power of sale contained in a deed to secure debt and naming J. B. Hinson and J. B. Paul Hinson as defendants.  It was alleged that Paul Hinson executed a note for $ 49,880.79 plus 6% interest, which note was endorsed by J. B. Hinson; that the note was secured by a deed to secure debt to a certain tract of land on which was located a motel, fixtures and personalty; that the note was in default with an amount due of $ 30,157.35 plus interest; that foreclosure proceedings were instituted under the power of sale contained in the security deed and, after due and legal advertisement made, the sale took place; that the highest and best bid for the property was $ 21,000, such bid being made by an agent and director of the bank; that such amount was insufficient to pay the note and a substantial deficiency exists; that a confirmation of the sale under Code Ann. &sect; 37-608, et seq. (Ga. L. 1935, p. 381) is desired; that the court hear evidence as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the true market value of the property sold and that the sale be confirmed if the court is satisfied the property brought its true market value at the foreclosure sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant J. B. Hinson filed a plea to the jurisdiction asserting that he is a resident of Camden County and that the superior court of that county has jurisdiction rather than Charlton Superior Court; that the statute in question violates the Constitutional provisions as to venue since it requires the sale be reported &quot;to the judge of the superior court of the county in which the land lies . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant J. B. Hinson also filed his demurrers on the grounds: that the petition set forth no cause of action; that the statute (Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37-608 -- 37-611) violates Art. VI, Sec. XVI, Par. I of the Georgia Constitution in that it deprives the defendant of the right to a trial by jury; that the provision for venue contained in the statute (Code Ann. &sect; 37-608) contravenes Art. VI, Sec. XIV, Par. III and Art. VI, Sec. XIV, Pars. IV, V and VI of the Georgia Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge overruled the plea to the jurisdiction and the defendant's demurrers.  The defendant answered, denying the material allegations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the bank's application and asserting the plaintiff bank was estopped to seek confirmation by its conduct in re-selling the property pending the confirmation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence adduced before the trial court, on the testimony of a single witness, an official of the bank, was substantially as follows.  The property, real and personal, was sold for $ 21,000.  The market value of this property was about $ 19,000, of which $ 8,900 was the approximate value of the personalty and $ 10,100 the approximate value of the realty.  The witness admitted his evaluation of the market value of the property was based in part on an appraisal made by another party, who was not called as a witness, and in part on his somewhat cursory examination of the premises.  He also testified that the bank and a third person had executed instruments for the sale of the property.  However, no delivery had taken place and the trust department of the bank was holding &quot;in escrow&quot; the papers and two checks tendered to the bank by the prospective purchaser pending the confirmation of the sale made pursuant to the power of sale contained in the security deed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murder.  Chattooga Superior Court.  Before Judge Coker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the January term of Chattooga Superior Court, Roy Dale Chatterton and Woodrow Whisman were separately indicted by the grand jury of Chattooga County for the offense of murdering Billy A. Copeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant and Whisman were hitchhiking through this State from West Virginia to Florida on December 15, 1964, when they accosted the victim Billy Copeland who permitted them to enter his automobile and ride as his guests.  Copeland had started from LaFayette to Rome to carry his son home from school for the Christmas holidays.  After traveling several miles in the automobile the defendant and Whisman, by use of a knife and pistol, commandeered Copeland's automobile and kidnapped him.  They drove to a lonely and deserted house in Chattooga County, forced their victim to remove all of his outer clothing and robbed him of various articles including his knife, watch, gloves and jacket, together with $ 40 in money.  While rifling his pockets the thieves came upon a picture or private papers of Copeland.  When he asked for the picture or papers they became enraged and both struck him heavy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  blows with a board.  They then bound and dragged him into a back room of the house.  They left him semiconscious and in a critical condition.  The culprits drove the victim's automobile to Kentucky and when it finally would run no farther, they stole a Buick.  The latter car they drove to Guyton, Ga., where they were apprehended by officers on December 18, 1964.  At the time they were possessed of Copeland's coat, watch and gloves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerning their arrest, Detective Randolph Strickland testified that when apprehended and arrested on suspicion of having stolen the automobile they then were driving, Whisman, who had been placed by the officers with his hands against a wall, attempted to lower his hands in an effort to procure a knife he had in his pocket.  The officer related that Whisman in Chatterton's presence made the remark that had he been able to get to the knife he would have left the officer's &quot;guts&quot; lying in the street.  Strickland also testified that when arrested Chatterton gave his name as Caulfield and Whisman identified himself as Adkins.  They both protested they were entirely innocent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lodged in the Chatham County jail, the defendant and Whisman were interviewed by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Billy W. Fields and Randolph Strickland.  On December 22, 1964, the defendant made a written confession in the presence of Patricia Brown and Detectives Billy Fields and Randolph Strickland.  The circumstances concerning this confession were related by Billy Fields.  He testified: &quot;Q. I will ask you if Mr. Chatterton and Mr. Whisman made certain statements to you admitting that they killed Billy Copeland, the deceased in this case?  A. Yes, sir, they did.  Q. At any time prior to the making of any statement to you on the 22nd or after the 22nd, prior to that time, did you or anyone ever threaten, threaten or intimidate or harass Mr. Chatterton or Mr. Whisman in any way, nature or form whatsoever?  A. No, sir, we did not.  Q. Did you or anyone in your presence threaten to harm them in any way whatsoever, that is to say Chatterton or Whisman?  A. No, sir, we did not.  Q. Did either you or anyone in your presence, offer them any reward or benefit or hope of reward or benefit which could in any way possibly accrue to the advantage of either, in order to get them to make these various statements?  A. No, sir, we did not.  Q. The statements which they made, which Chatterton made and Whisman&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  made on the 22nd and at times after that, were all of those statements freely and voluntarily made by Mr. Chatterton and Mr. Whisman? A. Yes, sir, they were.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later the defendant made a similar confession to Emmett Whitfield, Jack Knott and Bill Hart.  The State's witnesses testified the defendant's confessions were freely and voluntarily made, and further testified the defendant was fully advised of his constitutional rights and positively stated he did not want a lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant in an unsworn statement insisted the confessions were induced by a threat and promise of F. B. I. Agent Boyle.  His statement was: that he was arrested on Friday night and taken to the Chatham County jail where he was kept in solitary confinement for approximately four days or until Tuesday morning; that he was out of solitary confinement before he made a statement; that he was interrogated at night, mostly by the F. B. I., three times while he was there; that he asked for an attorney when first brought to jail and was told they would give him one, but never got one; that when interrogated by the F. B. I. they suggested he make a statement and offered him inducements; that they did not offer him&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  anything the first time he was interrogated; that he asked for a lawyer but did not get one; that the second time he was interrogated no offers were made but he again requested a lawyer and still didn't get one; that an offer was made to him the night he confessed; that &quot;the gentleman in charge&quot; said &quot;if I would make a confession that he would see to it that I was committed to a mental institution;&quot; that the agent said if the defendant didn't admit being involved in the beating of Copeland &quot;he would see to it that I burned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant further related in his statement: that he asked for clothes and money and was told by the F. B. I. agent he would see about getting it; that the defendant had no way of even buying cigarettes and that Fields and Strickland were &quot;all time sending us cigarettes and coffee and stuff while we was in confinement&quot;; that he never told Fields about only being able to fry once; that when he made his confession to Fields he was still under the influence of statements made by the F. B. I.; that he wouldn't have talked with Fields except for the agent's influence and was relying on &quot;their promise to get him committed to a mental institution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sidney Smith, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an F. B. I.  Agent, testified that he was present during the entire time that Agent Boyle interviewed the defendant.  He did not recall Boyle having made a promise to the defendant that he would get off on a plea of insanity or that Boyle threatened that if the defendant did not confess he would see that the defendant got the electric chair.  On cross examination he admitted, in response to questions: &quot;Q. Do you recall Boyle advising him that if he would go ahead and make a statement, that he would see that he was able to enter a plea of insanity in his trial?  A. There was some talk of Chatterton saying that he had asked for psychiatric help at one time.  Q. And isn't it true that Mr. Boyle told him that if he didn't give a statement and get off on an insanity plea, that Mr. Boyle would see that he burned in the electric chair?  A. I don't recall that he said that.  Q. You recall some conversation about the electric chair, though, don't you?  A. Yes, I do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was interrogated by officers at night on several occasions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was found guilty.  The exception is to the trial court's judgment overruling his amended motion for new trial, consisting of the general&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grounds and nineteen special grounds.  The general grounds and special grounds 6, 7, 8, 9, 17 and 18 were abandoned.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The resolution that was adopted changed the education system. Prior to the resolution, three separate and distinct school systems existed in the county, and after, there was only one school district under the management of one county board of education. The petition alleged that a majority of those voting in the election in each of the systems approved the amendment, but that a majority of the voters of an independent school system voted against ratification. It was alleged that the approval of the majority of voters of the independent school system was required before the local amendment could become a part of the constitution. The court agreed with the lower court that the independent school system was not directly affected by the amendment. The amendment left that school system just as it was prior to the amendment. Thus, the amendment did not require ratification by the voters of the independent school system. The court further disagreed with the contention that the amendment violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, U.S. amendment. XIV. The amendment provided a rational method of selecting members of the board of education.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an equitable and mandamus action against the governing authorities of Chatham County seeking injunctive relief and to require the re-issuance of a building permit and a business license to build and operate a trailer park in that county.  The allegations show the building permit was issued but thereafter revoked, and suit filed to require the re-issuance of same and in a different count to enjoin interference with its use if valid, but upon agreement of both parties, the petitioner then applied for a business license to operate the trailer park, and after the filing of the litigation and the application for a license, a licensing ordinance was adopted which would prevent the operation of a trailer park within 1,200 feet of any school ground or college campus, after which the licensing application was likewise denied, and the petitioner amended his petition to add an additional count to demand the issuance of the business license.  The crux of the matter is the location of the proposed trailer park within 1,200 feet of Armstrong State College, a part of the University System of Georgia.  The Board of Regents&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  objected to the location of the trailer park and by intervention seek to prevent its licensing and construction, alleging it is in violation of the licensing ordinance requiring it to be more than 1,200 feet from any school ground or college campus, the ordinance being adopted to protect the safety, health, welfare and public morals of the citizens of Chatham County on October 30, 1964.  The licensing ordinance is apparently adopted under and by virtue of the authority of Ga. L. 1952, p. 617 (constitutional amendment authorizing Chatham County to police said county and to levy occupational taxes) and Ga. L. 1919, p. 604 (authorizing Chatham County to adopt ordinances and regulations for the security and welfare of its inhabitants).  The amended petition attacks the provisions of the ordinance requiring that trailer parks be more than 1,200 feet from any college campus as being unconstitutional, unlawful, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable and discriminatory in that the passage of same involved the petitioner's private property rights and was passed without proper notice, public or private, which is violative of the due process clauses of the State Constitution (Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2-102, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2-103; Const. of 1945), the same being designed to specifically exclude petitioner from the use of his property.  The case came on for a hearing before the court without the intervention of a jury, and after hearing evidence and consideration of the stipulation of facts, the court granted the mandamus as to the issuance of a building permit but denied the prayers for the granting of a business license.  The plaintiff filed a motion for new trial which was later amended, and after a hearing overruled.  The main bill excepts to the final judgment on the motion for new trial as amended, and the cross bill excepts to the court order requiring the county to issue the building permit.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner filed an action for equitable relief after the authorities denied his applications for a business license and a building permit in connection with a proposed trailer park. The trial court granted mandamus as to the building permit but denied relief as to the business license. Both parties appealed. The court affirmed the judgment as to the owner's bill of exceptions and dismissed the authorities' cross bill. The court found that the denial of the business license was a proper exercise of the authorities' power to regulate trailer parks. The court found that an ordinance prohibiting such parks from operating within 1200 feet of any educational facility was a valid exercise of the power conferred upon the authorities by 1919 Ga. Laws 604 and 1952 Ga. Laws 617. The court dismissed the authorities' cross bill, which challenged an order requiring the authorities to reissue the owner's previously-revoked building permit. Citing O.C.G.A. 6-901 (1957), the court found that it was without jurisdiction to review the order, noting that the final judgment involved in the cross bill would not have been affected even if the owner had been granted the relief that he requested.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction from the Charlton Superior Court (Georgia) of rape by force.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's first of many challenges to his conviction was that the jury array did not fairly represent the county based upon the systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service. The court rejected the claim because the jury array was prepared from the tax digests which by law were divided by race, and one jury commissioner asserted that race did not factor into the compilation of the jury array. Furthermore, defendant was not entitled to a jury makeup that was proportionate to the percentage of Negroes in the county. Denial of a motion for new trial was proper where the evidence that established the violence of rape supported the conviction for rape by force. It was not erroneous to admit defendant's confession where defendant during the investigatory stage volunteered the confession, and he had been advised of his rights but refused counsel. The trial judge's instruction that left the jury to decide if the confession was voluntary was not erroneous even though it did not follow federal precedent which the court took to task as illogical, and as not involving Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 38-420, which required the confession to have been corroborated.</SPAN></P>
