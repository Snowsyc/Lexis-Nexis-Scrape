</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A construction company built a chicken house for the owner. When the chicken house collapsed, the owner filed an action against the construction company and a corporation to recover damages for negligence, strict liability in tort, and breach of express and implied warranties. The owner's insurer intervened in the action. The construction owner and the corporation filed motions for summary judgment pursuant to the statute of limitations under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-41. The circuit court granted summary judgments for the construction company and the corporation. The owner and the insurer appealed, asserting that pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-67, the action was not barred by the statute of limitations because there was fraudulent concealment of deficiencies in the construction, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-41 was not applicable because it was limited to tort actions, and &sect; 15-1-41 was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the owner failed to show a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of fraudulent concealment, &sect; 15-1-41 did not distinguish between contract and tort actions, and &sect; 15-1-41 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the prosecutor had racially neutral explanations regarding his exercise of peremptory challenges. The court further held that the trial court's exclusion of convictions of over ten years age as to two witnesses was in accord with Miss. R. Evid. 609(a) and (b). Finally, the court held that there was not such a high risk of inaccuracy in fingerprint evidence as to require the state to hire defendant an expert in order to guarantee that he had a fundamentally fair trial.

Defendant filed a motion for j.n.o.v. or a new trial, which the trial court overruled. On appeal, the court affirmed because the officer arrived at the scene of the accident shortly after it occurred. Defendant identified himself as one of the drivers. At the hospital the officer smelled alcohol on defendant. The officer took him to jail to determine if he had been drinking and whether he was driving under the influence at the time of the accident. The officer told defendant he had a right to refuse the test or have a blood test done. Defendant consented to the test. At the time the officer took defendant to jail, he knew that an automobile accident had occurred, that someone had been seriously injured as a result, that defendant had been driving of one of the vehicles, and that defendant smelled of alcohol. The officer had reasonable ground to suspect that defendant had been operating his vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. The trial court did not err in admitting the officer's testimony.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, pursuant to U.S. Const. art. 4, &sect; 2, para. 1, the trial court was not permitted to make a distinction as to access to it between in- and out-of-state citizens. The court held that the doctrine of forum non conveniens was not applicable because it was not a seriously inconvenient forum and a more appropriate forum was not available.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was indicted for capital murder. He entered a guilty plea to a lesser charge of murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Thereafter, he filed a motion for post-conviction relief. The trial court denied the motion. The prisoner appealed arguing, among other things, that the post-conviction procedure as articulated in the Mississippi Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act (Act), Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-1 et seq. constituted a suspension of a writ of habeas corpus in violation of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890, Art. 3, &sect; 21 and denied him due process of law and equal protection. The prisoner also argued that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-1 et seq. impinged upon his constitutional rights. The court upheld the judgment. The court found that the prisoner lacked standing to challenge the provisions of the Act. The court reasoned the prisoner was afforded his constitutional rights and had not been disadvantaged under the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted for conspiracy to commit voter fraud through the illegal use of absentee ballots. They challenged their convictions, alleging, among other things, that there was outside influences on the grand jury and that a grand juror served on the petit jury that convicted them. The court found defendants received a fair and impartial trial before a learned and fair circuit judge and the verdict was supported by the evidence, However, the motion to quash the indictment because the grand jury was subjected to three distinct outside influences should have been granted. Two attorneys who were interested in having defendants indicted were present at the grand jury, but it was not shown they possessed any firsthand information concerning the alleged voter fraud. This was supported by the fact that neither testified at trial. Moreover, the grand jury was told in no uncertain terms by a judge's opinion that defendants were guilty. All that needed to be shown was that undue influence occurred in order to quash the indictment. Moreover, the constitutional requirement of an impartial jury prevented the grand juror from sitting on the petit jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conviction and quashed the indictment, and ordered defendants were to be held awaiting the action of another grand jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court of Leflore County (Mississippi) that was granted for the State of Mississippi. The circuit court denied appellant's motion for relief from convictions of armed robbery and grand larceny that were entered pursuant to his guilty pleas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant was apprehended for an incident at a gas station, he entered into a plea agreement with the State. Two years later, appellant filed his motion for post-conviction relief on the basis that his guilty plea was involuntary and due to his lawyer's ineffective assistance. The court affirmed the judgment denying relief. The circuit court provided appellant with a full evidentiary hearing on the motion that was denied on its merits, rather than due to any part of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-3 (Supp. 1985) of the Post-Conviction Relief Act. The court determined that a substantial evidentiary basis supported the conviction, and that appellant's plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered pursuant to Miss. Unif. Crim. R. Cir. Ct. Prac. 3.03(2). The circuit court carefully questioned appellant at the plea hearing, especially after he had initially equivocated about his involvement in the offenses. The circuit court advised appellant of what was required for his guilty plea and he fully admitted his culpability.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was a New Jersey corporation qualified to do business in Mississippi. The corporation purchased fuel refined in Mississippi and stored for distribution in Alabama. The corporation paid the Alabama sales tax. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that it was not error to find that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-6-7 did not unambiguously provide for a tax credit. The court found that &sect; 27-67-7 contemplated that a sales tax imposed in another state meant a tax properly imposed. The Alabama tax was an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. The tax failed to meet the substantial nexus prong because the sale was initially negotiated outside of Alabama, and under Alabama law the sale should have been considered a non-taxable event. The corporation had a right to challenge the improper Alabama tax in Alabama. The trial court's refusal to allow a credit under &sect; 27-67-7 did not constitute an unconstitutional discrimination on interstate commerce because &sect; 27-7-7 did provide for a credit where the sales tax in another state was properly imposed. Here the corporation cannot complain of multiple burdens when it voluntarily paid an improper tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased had one legitimate child who resided with his ex-wife, and after his death the ex-wife and deceased's mother filed a sworn petition for letters of administration. The petition stated there were two other children that were acknowledged but never legally adjudicated the deceased's children. The mother was granted letters of administration and notice to creditors was published, which required all persons having claims against the deceased's estate to register their claims within 90 days under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 91-1-15(3)(c). Thereafter, a wrongful death action was authorized with the legitimate child as the sole statutory heir. In reversing and remanding, the court held the chancellor erred when he ruled timely compliance with &sect; 91-1-15(3)(c) was required, as did the circuit judge. The court held since the mother, the administratrix knew of the illegitimate children, she should have given them notice of the issuance of letters of administration. Thus, the illegitimate children were entitled to share in the estate of their father and in any wrongful death settlement the same as legitimate children if there is no dispute that they are indeed his natural children.</SPAN></P>

She claimed that defendant owed her for a prior order and she went to defendant's apartment to collect. Defendant was not home at the time but his girlfriend was. The prosecutrix went back later and found defendant home but his girlfriend was gone. She claimed that defendant forced her into a bedroom where put a pillow over her face and raped her. Defendant alleged that it was error to refuse his motion for a directed verdict. On review, the court was of the opinion that the evidence presented a guilt issue for the jury and the trial court was not in error in overruling the motion for a directed verdict. The court noted that nothing in defendant's argument was convincing that the jury verdict was manifestly against the weight of the credible evidence. There was no error in refusing a mistrial based in alleged improper comments from the district attorney because defendant promptly objected, which the trial court sustained with instruction to the jury to disregard the question. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statute unconstitutionally discriminated against males.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chancellor ordered the father to pay child support in arrears. Several petitions for modification and amendment were presented by both parties, including the father's issues on his inability to pay. The chancellor ordered the incarceration of the father, and the chancellor dismissed all of the father's motions and barred him from bringing any matter before the court until he had paid the delinquency. On appeal, the court reversed the ruling because he was denied due process as guaranteed by the federal constitution and Miss. Const. art. 3, &sect; 30. The chancellor was authorized to punish the father for breach of decrees by fine or imprisonment and to imprison him for refusing to obey judgments of the court until he had complied with the judgment. However, where the contemnor was unable to pay, even if his inability was due to his misconduct, imprisonment could not accomplish the purpose of a civil contempt decree, which was to compel obedience. The father could not be imprisoned if he did not have the means by which he could purge himself of the contempt. The chancellor's order regarding the requirement of a ne exeat bond was correct.</SPAN></P>

An assailant fired three times with a shotgun, killing the victim and seriously injuring his daughter. Several weeks later defendant was arrested. He confessed to robbery and the murder, and he led law enforcement officers to the place where he threw away a money sack. The court denied defendant's motion to vacate or set aside the judgment, conviction, and sentence of death. The court could not consider issues raised and decided on direct appeal, even though theories for relief different from those urged at trial and on appeal were asserted. Claims that were available, but not previously asserted on direct appeal were waived and were not subject to further review. As to defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the court found that the actions of defendant's counsel fell into the permitted range of reasonable professional assistance under the facts of the case and the standards set forth in Strickland v. Washington and as guaranteed to the Mississippi and Federal Constitutions. The death sentence was imposed under conditions that afforded defendant a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder in the death of an individual in a murder-for-hire scheme. He received the death penalty. Thereafter, he filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied. Upon review, defendant questioned several aspects of the trial including the impartiality of the jury venire based on several ties to law enforcement, the racial make-up of the jury, allowing the jury to take notes, statements by the trial judge trivializing the role of the jury, an in-court identification, discovery errors, prosecutorial misconduct during the guilt phase, a denial of the criminal's request for a private psychologist, and double jeopardy. The court found that defendant made no objection to the racial make-up of the jury, or the in-court identification, or the juror notetaking. The alleged ties to law enforcement were bare assertions by defendant, and the judge's comments served to ease jurors' tensions and were not fundamentally unfair. While defendant had a right to a psychologist, he had no constitutional right to one of his choosing.

A jury found defendant guilty of both offenses. On appeal, he asserted that it was improper for the two offenses to have been consolidated, but the court pointed out that defendant had requested the consolidation. The court also held that defendant could not assign as error any prejudicial remarks by the prosecutor during closing arguments because defendant failed to object at the time of the remarks, but waited until he filed his motion for a new trial. Defendant raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found that defendant's trial counsel performed well, and the court rejected this claim. The issue as to defendant's intent, the issue of frustration by extraneous causes, the issue as to whether the incident occurred at night, and the determination of the credibility of the witnesses were factual issues for the jury to determine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a board of trustees for a municipal school district, issued a decision that terminated the employment of appellant school district employee in connection with an allegedly improper handling of a purchase of encyclopedias for the school district. The employee appealed. Based on its review of the record and oral arguments, the Chancery Court of Jackson County (Mississippi) affirmed the board's decision. The employee sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Unaware of the law as to single-source purchases, the employee bought encyclopedias for the school libraries from a single source. He and the superintendent later agreed to present the encyclopedia purchase order to the board for approval to purchase without revealing that the encyclopedias already had been purchased and delivered. On the same day that he revealed the truth of the matter, the superintendent resigned and the board began investigating the employee's role in the incident. The board fired the employee and the chancery court upheld his termination. On further review, the court held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 37-9-59 (1972 &amp; Cum. Supp. 1986) did not limit the board's power to investigate and initiate the employee's removal in the absence of the superintendent. Moreover, the board's decision did not violate the employee's procedural due process right to an expectancy in continued employment because a showing that the board participated in the events preceding the termination was not enough. Finally, there was substantial evidence that the employee participated in a misrepresentation to the board about a major single-source purchase, which constituted good cause for dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court, Jackson County (Mississippi), which convicted defendant of capital murder. Defendant was sentenced to die. Defendant's conviction arose out of actions involving the robbery and murder of a husband and wife, with the wife having watched the murder of her husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised numerous points of error on appeal, including that the judge who issued the warrant to search defendant's home was not a neutral and detached magistrate in that the judge was on the scene of the search and received compensation for every approved search warrant. Defendant also contended probable cause was not established justifying the search of his home and that the trial court erred in permitting the jury to see defendant shackled. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that the degree of a magistrate's involvement in the search determined whether bias existed and that the judge that issued the warrant to search defendant's home indicated no bias as he examined the affidavit, considered the oral testimony of the officers, and did not collect a fee for the service. The court held that probable cause existed, because the affidavit and the facts established a &quot;substantial basis&quot; of probable cause as items belonging to defendant were found at the scene and it was necessary to determine why. The court further held that the viewing by unselected jurors of defendant in shackles was not reversible error as such viewing was less than one hour.</SPAN></P>

The court further determined that the Batson rule applied so long as defendant made a timely objection to the manner by which the State had exercised its strikes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant commissioner sought review after the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County (Mississippi) concluded that he had jurisdiction to adjudicate plaintiff taxpayers' due process/Commerce Clause challenge to assessment of a sales tax and permanently enjoined the collection, assessment, or levy of the taxes under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-65-23 (Supp. 1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from the Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-65-23 (Supp. 1984) section of the sales tax portion of the Mississippi Code. The statute purported to impose a six percent tax on the gross income of taxpayers renting or leasing transportation equipment located outside the State of Mississippi through rental agreements entered into outside the State of Mississippi. The commissioner filed a motion to dismiss, challenging the jurisdiction of the chancery court to adjudicate the matter. The taxpayers filed a motion for summary judgment supported by affidavits. The trial court entered a permanent injunction. The court held that there was an insufficient nexus between the state and the taxpayers to allow them to be taxed consistently with the requirements of due process and the Commerce Clause. Although the trial court did not expressly label his decision a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 decision, he found for the taxpayers on every essential element of their claim. The fact that the statute was not cited per se was of no importance. The prevailing party in a &sect; 1983 action was ordinarily entitled to attorneys fees on a certain showing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order insofar as it denied the taxpayers' demand for a hearing for attorneys fees. The court remanded the case for a hearing on the demand for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Supreme Court remanded the action to the court after vacating the death sentence imposed upon defendant. The action was remanded for a determination of whether the Enmund requirements were met. The state filed a motion to reinstate the death sentence and a motion to set a new execution date. Defendant filed a cross-motion to remand to the trial court for a resentencing hearing or to impose a sentence of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that a remand to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary. The court held that it could properly examine and consider the original trial record and make a determination of whether the record supported the finding of at least one of the Enmund requisites. Because defendant was an accomplice to the murder and did not actually administer the lethal blows, Enmund required a determination of defendant's culpability prior to imposition of the death penalty. Under Enmund, the court was required to determine whether defendant was subject to the death penalty as one who attempted to kill, intended that a killing take place, or intended to employ lethal force. The court found that defendant's personal involvement and individual culpability sufficiently established that defendant intended to employ lethal force and that a death sentence could be imposed. Nevertheless, in the interest of justice, the court determined that defendant's punishment should be fixed at life imprisonment. Thus, the court overruled the state's motions to reinstate the death sentence and to set a new execution date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, the assistant manager of the employer's store, was killed during a robbery. While the employee left no dependents as defined by the Mississippi Worker's Compensation Act (MWCA), Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 71-3-25 (Supp. 1986), the family members, the parents and siblings of the employee, sought worker's compensation benefits. An administrative law judge determined that the family members were not entitled to recover benefits and the commission, and later the circuit court, affirmed the finding. The family members sought further review, and the court held that the exclusive remedy provision of &sect; 71-3-25, which operated to preclude the family members from either recovering worker's compensation benefits or recovering separately in tort, was not unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the purpose of the MWCA was to relieve the public from the burden of supporting the dependents of workers killed in the course of their employment, not to provide tort relief, and that the statute had a rational basis and furthered a valid state purpose although it did preclude recovery for certain injuries, including tort recoveries for non-dependents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was charged with unprofessional and unethical conduct because of his participation in a scheme to bribe the former state bank comptroller who was convicted on federal charges. The attorney testified as a witness for the prosecution. After affirming the conviction, the federal appellate court found the attorney guilty of conduct unbecoming a member of the bar of the appellate court and suspended him from practice for one year. The MSB's initial complaint based on the attorney's false testimony before the grand jury was dismissed by the Committee on Complaints without an investigatory hearing. On appeal of the dismissal of the second complaint, the court declined to decide whether double jeopardy rights attached in bar disciplinary proceedings but vacated the order because there was no final judgment entered by the committee on the merits of the first complaint. The court held that under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 73-3-341 (Supp.1984), the finding of the federal court was conclusive evidence of the attorney's guilt of unprofessional conduct, which was supported by the record. Based on his age and his first offense, the court suspended his license for one year.</SPAN></P>

The court denied his motions for post-conviction relief and request for a stay of execution. The affidavits of a clinical psychologist and a psychiatrist failed to establish to a reasonable probability that he was presently insane. With regard to other issues raised in the petition, the court found that there was an insufficient showing of &quot;cause&quot; to excuse petitioner's failure to raise the issues at the appropriate time in prior state proceedings. Thus, the claims were procedurally barred pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-21. Moreover, it was clear that the jury was unequivocally and properly advised on the unwavering burden of proof shouldered by the prerequisite to the jury's consideration of the death penalty. Counsel's failure to substantiate any reason why a claim based on newly-discovered evidence could not have been discovered and raised in earlier stages of an appeal also barred the claim under &sect; 99-39-21.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder and was sentenced to death. During the course of the sentencing phase, the State offered defendant's prior conviction for assault in the second degree with intent to commit rape in the first degree. This was offered as an aggravating circumstance under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101(5)(b) to support the death penalty. In this petition, for the first time, defendant argued that the prior assault conviction was invalid. The court found that defendant did not appeal the prior conviction and had served time. Further, even if the jury should not have considered this prior conviction, the remaining two aggravating circumstances were sufficient to support the death penalty. In so ruling, the court applied the harmless error standard. Defendant also contended that his trial counsel was ineffective, depriving him of his Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel. The court held that defendant did not show that his counsel's performance was incompetent or that he was prejudiced thereby. A conscious choice of trial strategy by defense counsel, which proves unfortunate, was not to be equated with incompetency.</SPAN></P>

The board moved to dismiss for improper venue, and the chancery court denied the motion. The board appealed and the court reversed the judgment. The court ruled that the board's motion for a change in venue should have been sustained. The court held that the chancery court's interpretation of the venue statute of the act was too broad and that it would be unreasonable to interpret it as stating that the board was subject to suit in any county where it conducted business, which meant that the board would be required to defend actions in all 82 counties in Mississippi.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action by plaintiff senators, defendant, the Lieutenant Governor of the State of Mississippi, appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Hinds County (Mississippi), which declared that the Lieutenant Governor, as an officer of the Executive Department, violated Miss. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 1,2 (1890) by exercising the powers granted to him pursuant to certain Mississippi Senate Rules respecting appointment of committees and referral of bills.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The senators sought a declaratory judgment concerning the legality of the powers exercised by the Lieutenant Governor pursuant to Miss. Sen. R. 5-7, 17-19, 36-38, 48, 65, 74, 75. Those rules related to the Lieutenant Governor's power to appoint committees and refer bills to committees. The circuit court declared that the Lieutenant Governor was a member of the Executive Department of the state government and that Miss. Sen. R. 7, 36-38, 48, 74 , 75 were unconstitutional because, in the exercise of those powers, he exercised legislative powers prohibited to him by Miss. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 1, 2 (1890). On cross-appeals, the court found that it had subject matter jurisdiction and that the senators had standing to sue because the Lieutenant Governor's ongoing actions had a sufficient adverse impact upon them. The court concluded that the Lieutenant Governor, who was President of the Senate, was eligible to have the powers conferred upon him as a member of the Senate. Moreover, the Senate could amend or rescind its rules any time it wished. Thus, the court reversed the circuit court's judgment and denied the senators' cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the Lieutenant Governor's direct appeal, the court reversed and rendered. On the senators' cross-appeal, the court affirmed. The court ordered that a declaratory judgment be entered in favor of the Lieutenant Governor, and denied the senators' motion for payment of their legal expenses. The Lieutenant Governor's motion to stay or, in the alternative, petition for writ of supersedeas was denied as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state brought an action for declaratory judgment against appellant elected officials, alleging they were in violation of Miss.

On appeal, the court affirmed in part as to some appellants, and reversed in part as to other appellants. The court held that the Mississippi Attorney General had the authority to file and prosecute this suit, but his failure to do so did not deprive the Mississippi Ethics Commission of doing so. The governmental bodies contracting with appellant state officials could not have made payment under their contracts without making the improper appropriations, and their conduct was violative of &sect; 109. Additionally, the court held that some appellants violated &sect; 109, and the provisions of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 25-4-105(3)(h) which purported to authorize their dual employment was manifestly at odds with the Mississippi Constitution and was therefore void. Finally, the court affirmed the chancery court judgment on cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of sexual battery of a child under the age of twelve in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-95 (1986) and he appealed. The court affirmed the conviction. It found no merit in defendant's claim that the statute under which he was convicted was void for vagueness and violated due process of law. The court found that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-95 gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that defendant's conduct was forbidden. Defendant admitted inserting his finger into the ten year old victim's vagina but denied removing her panties, licking between her legs, rubbing between her legs, and masturbating himself to ejaculation during the episode. The court also found there was sufficient proof of criminal intent. Defendant claimed he was checking the victim to see if another person had sexually abused her. The court found the intent to do the forbidden act was the only intent necessary to complete the offense. Defendant admitted putting his finger in the victim's vagina under circumstances that suggested a lustful or licentious state of mind and that was sufficient evidence of his intent.</SPAN></P>

The board denied him access and the resident filed suit, seeking an injunction prohibiting the board from removing or assigning leadership in academic programs among the universities until the court addressed constitutional issues of the board's authority.The board filed a motion to dismiss the action for the resident's failure to show standing to litigate the constitutional and statutory provisions, and filed a motion for change of venue. The lower court denied both motions and set the case for trial. The board filed an interlocutory appeal with supersedeas, which the court granted. The court affirmed the decision of the lower court and remanded for trial. The court held that the resident was a proper party as a citizen to have asserted a claim of adverse effect challenging the validity of the constitutional provision and legislative statutes pertinent thereto.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the prosecutor intentionally exercised the state's peremptory challenges to exclude black potential jurors on the basis of race and that the state failed to produce to defendant's counsel exculpatory information. It was undisputed that all of the state's peremptory challenges were used to exclude blacks. Defendant also alleged a violation of his constitutional right to a trial drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. Defendant's application to proceed in the circuit court was denied. The court did not pass judgment on the merits of defendant's allegations because his claim was barred by Mississippi Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act, Mississippi Code Annotated, &sect;&sect; 99-39-1 to 99-39-29 (Supp. 1985). Failure to raise an issue capable of resolution at trial or on direct appeal constituted a waiver absent a showing of cause and actual prejudice. Defendant knew that the state had used all of its peremptory challenges to exclude blacks at trial, yet no motion or objection was entered. Although the state failed to disclose that a witness had been an informant, the error was harmless given the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial District of Jones County (Mississippi), which convicted him of possession of pentazocine, commonly known as Talwin, in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-139 (Supp. 1985) of the Uniform Controlled Substances Law of 1971.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer pulled defendant's car over because only one headlight was burning. During a pat down, the officer found a syringe with clear liquid in it. Defendant stated that there was nothing in the syringe that the officer could use against him because he had already used it all. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for possession of pentazocine. Defendant was not entitled to a mistrial based on the district attorney's statement during closing that defendant told them he used it all. Such comment was not upon defendant's failure to testify at trial. Instead, it was a comment upon defendant's admission to the officer. The court rejected defendant's contention that there was an insufficient amount of Talwin found in his possession to constitute a crime. Any identifiable amount, however slight, constituted a crime. The Talwin that was found in the syringe, coupled with defendant's boast when he was arrested that he had used it all, evidenced possession of a greater amount. Defendant's conviction did not result from an unconstitutional violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. His alleged conviction of possession of illegal drug paraphernalia was under a different statute.</SPAN></P>

The commission had found that she had demonstrated improper dealing, Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A broker opened a branch office at a realty company owned by a licensee whose broker's license had been revoked. An audit of the company's escrow account revealed that a real estate salesman at the branch office had retained earnest money and had conducted other business without the broker's knowledge. The commission found that the broker had failed to adequately supervise her salespersons under Rule 6 and demonstrated bad faith, incompetency, or improper dealing under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 73-35-21(m) (Supp. 1985) and ordered the revocation of her license. On appeal from the trial court's dismissal of her appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) the commission's decision was not arbitrary or capricious because substantial evidence, including the fact that the broker did not intend to devote full energy to the branch office and that she made infrequent visits thereto showed that she did not exercise strict supervision of the salesman; (2) as such, the salesman's illegal acts were not impermissibly imputed to her; and (3) due process was not violated because the broker had an opportunity to present and to cross-examine witnesses despite her reluctance to assert such rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, as no reversible error was committed during the guilt phase of the trial. The court, however, found that defendant did not receive a fundamentally fair sentencing hearing due to: (1) the admission of the photographs of a murder victim for whom defendant was not on trial in the instant matter; (2) the &quot;slide show&quot; of such pictures during closing argument; (3) the prevention of a witness for defendant from testifying; (4) improper voir dire; (5) the &quot;last chance&quot; argument to the jury; and (5) the comment by the prosecutor on defendant's failure to testify. In effect, the photographs, the slides, and the &quot;last chance&quot; argument allowed the jury to sentence defendant to death for killing the wife of the victim. The improper voir dire and accompanying closing argument told the jury to ignore the only factors defendant could have presented in mitigation of the death penalty. The court concluded that as the jury imposed a penalty of death on the basis of passion, prejudice, and matters extraneous to the issue before it, that penalty had to be reversed. Thus, the death penalty was vacated, and that portion of the judgment remanded.</SPAN></P>

The trial court convicted defendant and sentenced him as a habitual offender under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-83 (Supp. 1985). On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred when it overruled defendant's motion for a mistrial on the grounds that the prosecution unnecessarily introduced evidence of a crime unconnected with the one for which defendant was on trial. The court held that: (1) in Mississippi, proof of a crime distinct from that claimed in an indictment was not admissible against an accused; however, in the instant case, testimony concerning another crime was admissible under an exception to the general rule in that the testimony was necessary to identify defendant; (2) the trial court enjoyed a considerable amount of discretion about relevance and admissibility of evidence and unless that discretion was so abused as to be prejudicial to the accused, an appellate court would not reverse a trial court's ruling on evidence; and (3) the re-indictment of defendant was not the result of prosecutorial vindictiveness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. He then sought relief on direct appeal, but his conviction and sentence were affirmed. He then sought federal habeas relief, and his death sentence was set aside.

He then sought post-conviction relief, but such relief was denied him, and he appealed that denial. On appeal, that denial was affirmed via a relatively short order declaring that all of defendant's claims were either procedurally barred due to his failure to raise them earlier or else had previously been litigated. Defendant then sought reconsideration of that decision. The court reconsidered, and it found that its earlier decision affirming the denial of post-conviction relief was correct. In so ruling, however, the court addressed multiple issues that it had previously held either procedurally barred, noting its concern with federal court rulings deeming inconsistent, from case to case, the state's application of its procedural default rules. On the merits, the court considered and rejected defendant's substantive claims.</SPAN></P>

Because the inmate challenged the weight and sufficiency of the evidence on direct appeal, the issue was rendered res judicata by the prior judgment affirming his conviction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was indicted, he was committed to a mental hospital as dangerous and not competent to stand trial. Five years later, it was determined that he was competent, and the trial was set less than six weeks after the State was notified of the change in his condition. The court ruled that although the delay in prosecution was lengthy, it came about in good faith and for good reasons. No specific length of time determined whether or not the right to a speedy trial was abridged. Rather, a balancing test was used that considered the conduct of both sides. Principal factors included the length of delay, the reason, defendant's assertion of his rights, and prejudice to him. Delay alone was not sufficient for a finding that a speedy trial was denied. The most important factor in defendant's case was that the delay was attributable to him. While he did not deliberately cause the delay, it was due to his condition, which was out of the State's control. The trial was also set quickly after defendant asserted his right, which was effectuated by the notice from the mental hospital that he was competent. Defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>

The court declared that &sect; 41-13-29(3)(c) in its entirety was void as in violation of the state constitution. The legislature had provided two schemes for the appointment of trustees; one as a general law for the state of Mississippi and one as a law that applied only in Jones County, Mississippi. Such a procedure was forbidden by the state constitution. The court ordered the county board of supervisors to appoint trustees to the hospital pursuant to Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department filed its petition on January 15, 1985, alleging that the mother of the child, who was born on June 13, 1982, was deemed to have made an assignment to the Department for past, present, and future child support by her acceptance of public assistance. The putative father denied that the child was his and claimed that neither the child's mother nor the Department had legal standing to bring this suit against him because Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 93-9-9 (Supp. 1985) provided a one-year statute of limitations that was applicable to the mother as well the Department. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that although &sect; 93-9-9 required the mother of a child to institute paternity proceedings within one year of the child's birth, the Department was not bound by this statute of limitation. The court rejected the putative father's equal protection arguments because &sect; 93-9-9 did not embellish the rights of welfare mothers to petition to have paternity established, but simply recognized the independent rights of interested public authorities, and a child was not limited by the one-year limitations imposed therein regardless of whether he or she received welfare.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the later search of defendant's house was based on probable cause, even though the issuing magistrate relied on information that defendant's companion had a history as a drug user.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence was overwhelming as to the proof that the elements of burglary were shown. The jury was justified in inferring that defendant intended to commit a crime after he broke into a home, because he had removed his pants. The court rejected the contention that the sentence was disproportionate to the offense. The prior convictions of defendant were mayhem and manslaughter (the victim was killed after being raped), crimes of a violent nature. The court had specifically held that &sect; 99-19-83 was constitutional, and it did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment as applied to the facts of the case. Defendant asserted that he was unlawfully detained in the penitentiary on the mayhem charge and that the confinement could not be applied to enhance his sentence under &sect; 99-19-83. Court records showed that a petition for revocation of probation was filed prior to the expiration of the probationary period for that crime. This tolled the running of the probationary period. The lower court acted on the petition within a reasonable time and his subsequent sentence was lawful. The trial court was correct in sentence defendant as an habitual offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked as a television reporter. The employee worked full-time until she was unable to return to work after the premature birth of her son. The employee resigned from her job, but later returned to work on a part-time basis. The employee often worked from home. After a telephone conversation with her supervisor, the employee agreed to go to the television station to edit a newspaper report. The employee was killed en route to the station when a tire on the car that she was driving sustained a blow-out, causing her to crash into another vehicle. The employee's family filed a claim for workmen's compensation benefits. After an administrative decision, the family sought judicial review. The circuit court found that the employee's death arose out of and in the course of her employment but awarded benefits based on the employee's part-time wage. The court affirmed on appeal, holding that the employee's death was compensable as an exception to the comings and goings rule because the employee worked from home. The court also found that the employee's wage calculations were proper. However, the court reversed, finding that the family was not required to prove dependency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot the owner of a convenience store during a robbery. Defendant was convicted, and at a second trial in the penalty phase, sentenced to death. The court affirmed, holding, among other things, that the trial court was not in error in describing pecuniary gain and robbery as aggravating circumstances; this did not constitute a stacking of the same factors under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101(5) (1985). That section enumerated eight factors and provided that only those factors could be submitted as aggravating circumstances in a sentencing trial. Under &sect; 99-19-101(7), the jury needed only to find one aggravating circumstance to impose the death penalty and thus, even if robbery and pecuniary gain were considered as one factor, the additional factor by the jury was sufficient. Further, the court held that the jury did not have to be instructed that they were required to apply a &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; standard in weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The jurors were required to find the &quot;existence&quot; of aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, but there was no obligation to apply the standard to the weighing of the factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plan directed an ad valorem tax rebate to the elderly and disabled for the tax year 1982. The court found that only the state legislature had the power to exempt property from municipal taxation and that Miss. Const. art. IV, &sect; 100 prevented the city from remitting liability owed to it for unpaid taxes. The city's proposal of redistributing money that it had already collected was an attempt to do indirectly what the constitutional provision prohibited directly. The court affirmed the declaratory judgment against the city because the legislature's delegation of power to tax did not include power to exempt from taxation or power to remit taxes. The court held that the rebate was repugnant to both statutory law and state constitution, and that the rebate plan was an ultra vires act beyond the city's authority to enact. The court also held that the city's conduct was an abuse of discretion that did not constitute a public purpose for which municipal funds could have been lawfully disbursed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to being convicted, defendant claimed that the 20-year sentence was unconstitutionally harsh. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that the jury was given conflicting evidence and acted within its authority in resolving the conflicts in the evidence. The court rejected the claim that he should have been allowed to cross-examine a witness concerning another individual's confession. The court noted that nothing in the record suggested that the witness had testified concerning the confession. Applying a three-pronged test to determine the constitutionality of imposing the maximum sentence for the crime as required by the state's three-strike law, Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 99-19-81 (Supp. 1985), the court held that the punishment was valid. The gravity of the crime, setting fire to a house occupied by women and children, and harshness of the penalty were proportionate. Additionally, the court held that non-habitual offenders were also subject to the 20-year maximum for arson under &sect; 99-17-1 (1972) , and other states, including Alabama and Tennessee imposed 20-year sentences for the same crime.</SPAN></P>

The Board charged the nurse with professional misconduct for her failure to follow the Board's procedures for certification as a nurse anesthetist under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 73-15-29(f) (1972).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the nurse's hearing she had been a nurse anesthetist for 16 years after graduating from a school of anesthesia. At the time of her graduation, special certification as a nurse anesthetist was not required. The Board contended that a letter was sent to the nurse regarding the new rules and regulations and that there was a grandfather clause for nurses who had been practicing for a continuos period for 15 years prior to 1970 with a deadline to notify the Board. On appeal, the court reversed the chancellor's decision that there was inadequate documentation of the Board's rules and regulations. The court held that the nurse failed to object to the lack of documentation at the hearing and, thus, she was precluded from raising the issue on appeal. The court held that the grandfather clause, in setting a time limitation upon certification, denied the nurse the equal protection of the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held the different licensing procedure for nurse anesthetists and for registered nurses was arbitrary and unreasonable. Therefore, the court affirmed the reinstatement of the nurse's license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery in the Circuit Court of DeSoto County (Mississippi) and sentenced to a term of 10 years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the trial court erred in sentencing defendant to a greater sentence than he received after his first trial. The court adopted the United States Supreme Court's Pearce rule, as modified by Wasman, and held that the imposition of a harsher sentence by a judge following a new trial and conviction for the same charge did not violate the federal or Mississippi Constitutions. However, due process required that a defendant be freed of apprehension that the trial court had a retaliatory motivation. In order to assure that such a motive was absent, the trial court was required to affirmatively state in the record his reasons for the harsher sentence, which had to be based upon objective information identified after the original sentencing proceeding. The factual data upon which the increased sentence was based had to be made a part of the record. The reason given for defendant's harsher sentence was the physical and mental condition of the victim. No factual data appeared in the record that tended to prove that her condition at the second trial was any worse than it was at the first trial. Thus, the trial court did not rebut the presumption of vindictiveness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction but reversed his sentence of 12 years and ordered that a sentence of 10 years be substituted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant board of trustees (Board) challenged the decision of the Chancery Court, Hinds County (Mississippi), which granted an injunction against the Board for violating the Open Meetings Act, Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A publisher filed an action against the Board and alleged violation of the open meetings act by meeting in executive session in instances not permitted by the statute, by going into executive session without making necessary preliminary findings, and by committing various minutes and record-keeping violations. An amended pleading included allegations that the publisher was excluded by the Board from a luncheon with student leaders. The trial court granted a permanent injunction and the Board appealed. The court held that the Board violated the open meetings act. Its sessions provided invaluable aids for fact finding by the Board and, as such, were part of the deliberative stages of the decision making process leading to the formation and determination of public policy. The exclusion of the publishers' employee from a luncheon between the Board and the university student body presidents violated the open meetings act because it was not a purely social affair outside purview of open meetings act. The written program was distributed and items of business were discussed. The permanent injunction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The permanent injunction against the Board for violating the open meetings act was affirmed, with the minor exception of the personnel definition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an African-American. The murder victim was a white female, who worked as an attendant at a convenience store. A white policeman was shot twice when an African-American suspect was apprehended at the convenience store. At trial, defendant presented an alibi defense. On appeal, the court thought that the evidence was sufficient to present jury questions regarding whether capital murder was committed and whether defendant was the person who committed the crime. The court found that the trial court's refusal to pay for defendant's experts did not constitute reversible error even though defendant was indigent. The court did not believe that the trial court erred by admitting testimony regarding the amount of money that was stolen from the store. The court reasoned that the business records exception applied even though the witness did not personally make the daily reports of cash on hand. In reversing the judgment, however, the court held that the trial court should have granted defendant's motion for a change of venue due to extensive and prejudicial pretrial publicity. The court found that it was impossible for defendant to have received a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the students were suspended under a mandatory policy for defacing school property, their parents obtained an order enjoining enforcement of the suspension pending a hearing before the board.

The parents then obtained a permanent injunction, and the board appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the lower court's decision and found that the board acted within the discretionary authority granted to it by statute. The court held that the exercise of a board's authority would not be disturbed unless it infringed upon some state or federal constitutional right, and it found that the policy, although mandatory, when fairly viewed, was constitutional because it furthered substantial legitimate interests of the school district.</SPAN></P>

Defendant served two years and nine months. Defendant was several years later indicted for the burglary and attempted rape charges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 15-year old defendant was convicted of raping an elderly woman who unsuspectingly entered a church building one afternoon. All of the facts save penetration were uncontested and the evidence there was adequate. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, stating that the trial judge was correct when he denied defendant's motion to quash the indictment. Contrary to defendant's arguments, the Mississippi rape sentencing scheme did not violate defendant's rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United State. Further, because the offense was one potentially punishable by life imprisonment under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-65(1), it was expressly excepted from youth court jurisdiction under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-21-105(j). Additionally, the court stated that the trial court was within its discretion when it denied defendant's motion for change of venue, was correct when it overruled objections to admission of defendant's confession, was correct when it denied defendant's assorted challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, and was within its discretion when it denied defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

He also argued that the trial court erroneously refused to issue an injunction to stay the appointment of the commissioned officer's successor. The court rejected the commissioned officer's arguments. The court noted that Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father contended the trial court erred in not considering the 1981 amendments to the descent among illegitimate statute and the wrongful death statute. The court found that the argument had merit. It was of the opinion the trial court erred in not considering the amendments to Mississippi Code Annotated &sect;&sect; 91-1-15 and 11-7-13, and in doing so, erred in not permitting the putative father to authoritatively establish his claim as the biological father of the decedent. The amended statute was remedial and gave a child a three year limitation period, after July 1, 1981, to file a claim against a natural father's estate. The language was broad enough to include the claim of a natural father to inherit from the child. The cause was remanded so that the proportionate interest of the half-sister and the father and his children might be judicially determined. The court then expressed its concern as to whether the sporadic and meager support by the father for the decedent equaled the &quot;support&quot; intended by Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 91-1-15 (3)(i).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two attorneys chose to have a formal hearing after being informed of the complaint committee's decision to issue a public reprimand for their failure to file a timely appeal for a criminal defendant and to properly withdraw as counsel. The state bar complaint tribunal imposed a two-year suspension from the practice of law on the lead attorney under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 73-3-319(c) and a private reprimand on the other attorney. The attorneys appealed, claiming that the complaint tribunal violated their right to due process of law. The court reversed and remanded the private reprimand imposed upon the other attorney. The court found that the other attorney was improperly disciplined on the basis of findings of wrongdoing not charged in the formal complaint and therefore the absence of fair notice as to the reach of the grievance procedure and precise nature of the charge deprived him of procedural due process. The court affirmed the two-year suspension of the lead attorney. The court held that the suspension was not excessive or unreasonable and that although the local circuit court rules did not cover withdrawal of counsel, the lead attorney was required to formally withdraw.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's objections to the state's closing arguments in both the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial, holding that: (1) it was improper for defendant to hold his objections to the guilt phase closing argument until its conclusion, as the trial court thus was robbed of the ability to cure any prejudice from improper argument and (2) the state's sentencing closing argument was fair argument and defendant did not preserve any objection. The court held that the trial court properly excluded testimony that the patrolman had previously killed a black man, as it was irrelevant. The court held that the death sentence was proportionate and that the fact that defendant's companions received life sentences was not a relevant mitigating circumstance.</SPAN></P>

He was found guilty of burglary of a dwelling and the court affirmed. It found that the weekend home was a dwelling for purposes of the burglary statute, as the owners visited the home and spent the night every two or three weekends and kept clothing, furniture, food, and other amenities of life at the home. There was also sufficient evidence for the jury to infer that defendant entered the home with the intent to steal, as there was partially thawed food in the home, the appliances that were missing, and a lock was broken. That evidence, coupled with defendant's entry into the home hours after the owners' arrival, formed a basis for the jury to infer that defendant had been surprised by the owners and fled and returned after the owners had departed. Finally, the court affirmed defendant's sentence because, while there were some intemperate comments by the trial court indicating displeasure with defendant's exercise of his right to trial by jury, it was apparent that the basis of the sentence was the sentencing report.</SPAN></P>

On remand, the trial court found that the statute was constitutional and that because the statute required both marriage of the parents and acknowledgment of the child, the trial court's ruling that it was constitutional effectively barred appellant from his claim of a right to inherit. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. In between the first decision by the trial court and the court's first opinion the statute was amended so as to expressly provide for an illegitimate's right to assert heirship.

Physical evidence in the car of bodily fluids and clothing in addition to the location of other objects corroborated the prosecutrix's story. The court affirmed the judgment.

In doing so, the court held that the taxpayers had no access to a judicial forum to thwart legislative matters such as the decision to undertake public improvements and to finance same with a bond issue unless such actions contravened the authority of the legislative body. Accordingly, nothing in the due process guarantee of the Mississippi Constitution afforded any citizen the right to reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to be heard before such legislative actions were taken.

In so ruling, the court pointed out that it had no right to substitute its judgment for that of the legislature as part of the determination as to whether the statute violated the state or Federal Constitution. The court saw no such violation of either the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses of the Mississippi or Federal Constitutions. Thus, the court ruled, it was for the legislature to set the policy as to who was denied benefits; the court also noted that there was a division of authority on the issue.

The court further held that the jury instructions did not improperly shift the burden of proof to defendant, and the trial court did require the jury to find that defendant intended to kill the victim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Circuit Court, Warren County (Mississippi) for capital murder and his sentence of execution, asserting that the trial court erred in not declaring a mistrial when the prosecution referred to two prior murders committed by defendant in his opening statement and referred to the fact that defendant had been sentenced to death for those murders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another man robbed and killed two people in Georgia. They took one of the victim's vehicles and headed west. They stopped at a rest area in Mississippi to sleep and decided to steal another vehicle to prevent apprehension. A man was sleeping in his car next to the vehicle defendant had stolen. He and his accomplice jumped the man, and defendant dragged him into the woods, where he shot him. They took the vehicle and fled. Defendant ultimately turned himself into police and confessed. At trial, the prosecutor advised the jurors of the other murders in his opening statement. He also mentioned that defendant had been sentenced to death in Georgia for those murders. The court held that the statements required a reversal. Although the killing of the Mississippi victim occurred within the context of the aftermath of other murders, there was a separation of time and motive which set the events apart and which were not so interrelated that the Georgia killings were a necessary part of the story which occurred in Mississippi. The reference to the Georgia death sentence was also improper because it lessened the jury's responsibility to decide whether to impose a death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentencing by the Circuit Court, Scott County (Mississippi) for rape under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-65(2) (Supp. 1984). He argued on appeal that his demurrer to the indictment should have been sustained on the ground that &sect; 97-3-65 violated equal protection because, although it established a crime for the rape of a female, it failed to also make it a crime to rape a male.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecutrix was raped in the middle of the night in her own bed at knifepoint. She testified that she was sure that defendant was her assailant because she recognized his voice, which was well-known to her. She also stated that when he put his mouth against her neck she didn't feel any teeth. Defendant's girlfriend, who lived in the same building, placed him there at about the time of the assault and also testified that he had no upper teeth. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that there was ample evidence to support the verdict and rejecting defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 97-3-65. Defendant argued that he was a member of a class, rapists of only women, that had been unreasonably singled out for punishment from the total class of rapists, including rapists of males. However, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-95 (Supp. 1984) criminalized sexual battery, defined as sexual penetration of another person. Thus, rapists of women had not been singled out for punishment. The court also affirmed that his sentence was properly imposed consecutively to that of another rape because the crimes were independent of each other and could be punished independently.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was serving a sentence for cattle theft when he escaped. His sentence was recomputed so that he was eligible to earn only 251 days of good time as opposed to being eligible for 654 days as he was prior to his escape conviction. He was convicted by the Circuit Court, Scott County (Mississippi) of escape and was sentenced to serve an additional four years in the state penitentiary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of escape under &sect; 97-9-45 Miss. Code Ann. (1972) and sentenced to four years imprisonment. He appealed and claimed the conviction and sentence was barred by the double jeopardy clause because his good time had been recomputed under an administrative procedure following his escape. The court found the revocation of good time was an administrative proceeding and that defendant was not unconstitutionally subjected to double jeopardy by the combination of the revocation of his good time and prosecution for escape. The court reversed and remanded for resentencing because defendant was convicted and sentenced under &sect; 97-9-45 Miss. Code Ann. (1972) which carried a maximum punishment of five years for escape from the state penitentiary. Because defendant did not escape from a state penitentiary but from a county jail, he should have been convicted and sentenced under &sect; 97-9-49 Miss. Code Ann. (1972), which provided a maximum sentence of only two years. The court found that while &sect; 97-9-49 Miss. Code Ann. (1972) had been amended to provide for a five-year sentence, the amendment was inapplicable because the amendment occurred after defendant's escape.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When pressured to admit that he acted alone, defendant replied that he preferred not to speak further. On appeal, the court held that there was no error in sustaining the state's challenge for cause of a prospective juror who stated that she would not follow the trial judge's instruction during the sentencing phase of a capital murder case because the juror was entirely opposed to capital punishment. The court held that defendant's misdemeanor arrest for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquors was valid because it was committed in the presence of the arresting officer. The court found that certain statements about the murder made by defendant after his misdemeanor arrest were properly admitted. However, the defendant, when pressured to admit he acted alone during interrogation, twice stated he preferred not to speak on that subject. The court held that he had effectively invoked his privilege against further self-incrimination. Reversing, the court ruled that the error in admitting the statements was harmful error because the statements made after he invoked his Miranda rights were qualitatively more incriminating than the statements made before.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also claimed that the prosecution's use of peremptory challenges to exclude Negroes from the jury violated his equal protection rights.

The court reasoned that the proffered evidence would only have served to impeach the officer's testimony, was not of such a nature that it would change the result, and it could have been discovered through due diligence before trial, defendant was not entitled to a new trial.

He was sentenced to seven years in prison with two years suspended upon the payment of a $ 3,000 fine.

The court held that a witness' reference during his testimony to another publicized crime within the community did not require a mistrial. The court found that the sentence imposed did not violate &sect; 30, which stated that there would be no imprisonment for a debt. The court found that the sentence did not violate the federal Equal Protection Clause. The court opined that the partial suspension of a sentence after five years of imprisonment upon payment of fine constituted an indefinite sentence in violation of Miss.

The lower court denied the divorce and ordered the husband to pay $ 500 a month for her separate maintenance. The court reversed and remanded. It found that the wife's conduct did not constitute habitual cruel and inhuman treatment as alleged by the husband but that she was not entitled to an award for separate maintenance. The court found that the award was improper because the wife admitted that the marital problems were the result of both parties' fault. By her own admission the wife was partly responsible and was not entitled to separate maintenance. The court also found she did not unconditionally agree to have the husband move back into the marital home, as she said she would so agree only if he agreed to undergo counseling. The condition meant that the wife's willingness to have her husband resume the marriage relationship was not complete.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer contended on appeal that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 77-3-39, which authorized public utility rates to be placed in effect subject to refund under bond, pending final administrative or judicial determination, deprived her of her property right to just and reasonable rates without notice and due process of law under Miss. Const. art. 3, &sect; 14, which she claimed was a more restrictive provision than the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The utilities argued that the customer had no property interest in existing rates, and thus no standing, and that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 77-3-39 was constitutional. The court reversed and rendered judgment. The court noted that the due process clauses of Miss. Const. art. 3, &sect; 14 and the Fourteenth Amendment were identical. The court determined that the customer had no specific vested property right in a fair and reasonable utility rate, that there was no unlawful delegation of legislative power to the utilities, and that the customer was not denied due process of the law. The court pointed out that courts had to presume that a statute was constitutional, and stated that the court could not say that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The lower court denied the relief and defendant appealed with numerous assignments of error. The court only considered the issue regarding his request to testify because the other issues had been previously disposed of by the court or were procedurally barred and affirmed the denial of the petition.

The Board's order, pursuant to Statewide Rule 48, Miss. Oil and Gas Board Rules (November 19, 1951), required the interstate pipeline company to take ratably the natural gas produced from a common source.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The interstate pipeline company purchased natural gas from fields in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi and transported it and sold it to customers along its pipeline. The Board ordered it to comply with Statewide Rule 48, which the Board promulgated to protect owners in a common pool from loss through drainage by requiring purchasers at the wellhead to take ratably. The pipeline company argued that state power to regulate natural gas production was preempted by the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3301 et seq., which granted the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) exclusive regulatory jurisdiction. The circuit court disagreed and affirmed the Board's order. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 3431(a)(1) of the NGPA provided that FERC's jurisdiction under the NGPA did not apply to deregulated gas. Thus, the NGPA did not constitute a federal preemption with respect to wellhead sales of deregulated natural gas. The court found that the Rule 48 was not an impermissible burden on interstate commerce because higher prices to consumers in another state did not render a state's regulation of commerce impermissible per se under the negative Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's order, which required the interstate pipeline company to take ratably the natural gas produced from a common source.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for capital murder and sentenced to death following a bifurcated jury trial. He appealed, arguing, among other things, that his confession should have been suppressed because he was incapable of waiving his Miranda rights, and that the evidence did not show the murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, as required for capital murder under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101(5)(h) (Supp. 1983). He also argued the jury instructions were improper and that death by lethal gas was unconstitutional as cruel and unusual punishment. The supreme court found that because defendant was of average intelligence and competent to stand trial, he could knowingly and intelligently waive his Miranda rights, especially where police were warning him, while he was confessing, that he had the right to be silent. Moreover, the evidence that defendant beat the victim with a maul and left him dying and in pain was sufficient for a murder conviction under &sect; 99-19-101(5)(h). Next, the court found there was no reversible error in the jury instructions. Finally, the issue of whether Mississippi's capital punishment statutes were constitutional was well settled in favor of the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bondsman brought suit for a declaratory judgment against appellants, alleging that &sect; 2 was unconstitutional and void because it was arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory inasmuch as the greater of one percent of the face value of the bond or $ 5 was assessed only against professional bail bondsmen, while other types of bonds were not so subjected. The circuit court found the challenged section to be unconstitutional, and appellants sought review. After an analysis of pertinent case law, the court noted that taxes had to be uniformly and equally collected from a class of similarly situated taxpayers if those within the class were to be treated equally under the law. The assessment also had to be reasonably related to a legitimate state interest, and the means chosen to effectuate that interest had to be reasonable. The court held that &sect; 2 did not discriminate within those designated in the class and that it served a legitimate state interest in that it was earmarked for correctional facilities.

Further, defendant's sentence did not violate the state or federal Constitution, given that he had been convicted of three non-violent felonies.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress a written statement, in refusing his requested instructions, in sentencing him as an habitual offender, and in allowing the district attorney to testify as a witness for the State. The court, however, affirmed the judgment. After signing a waiver of his Miranda rights, defendant stated that he was offered money to burn down three bars and that he and another set the bars on fire. Defendant made the statement as part of a bargain but was warned that he would be prosecuted if he repudiated the agreement. Nonetheless, he recanted the statement and refused to testify against the other person. The court determined that it was defendant who had initially made contact with police and that there was, thus, no improper coercion or influence. Defendant was acting as an informer and had agreed to be arrested on an assault charge so that he would not be found out. There was no error in instructing the jury that it was to determine the weight and credibility of the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was 16 years old, was involved in the kidnap and murder of her former husband. Defendant contended that the admission of her incriminating statements made in response to a deputy's question violated her constitutional rights to counsel, and that that the imposition of the death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but remanded for a new sentencing trial. There was no direct evidence that defendant stabbed the victim. However, defendant admitted to the kidnapping and capital murder was properly imputed to all three perpetrators. Defendant made the statement at issue at a time when the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached. The evidence of defendant's guilt as a principal was so overwhelming that the jury could have reached no other conclusion. However, the trial judge's statement that defendant's remark brought the death penalty convinced the court that the violation of defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel so infected the sentence phase that reversal was required. Defendant's age at the time of the crime remained a mitigating factor to be considered by the jury and was not by itself grounds for reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state claimed that defendant, a supervisor for the county, and a road foreman engaged in a scheme to defraud the county in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-11-31. Each month an individual who rented equipment to the county would call defendant to ask how defendant wanted him to charge the county. The road foreman agreed to cut a golf course's grass for pay but rarely did so. The equipment rental invoices included the mowing charges at its rate and concealed the road foreman's hours and charges. Defendant was convicted of perpetrating a fraud upon the county. The court affirmed, holding that defendant approved payments from the county that he knew were not in fact due any person. Defendant had no authority to informally establish and operate a park and golf course and to pay a private person or firm public money. Section 97-11-31 was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided a person of ordinary intelligence the opportunity to know what was prohibited. The state had the authority to prosecute defendant under &sect; 97-11-31 rather than Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 19-13-35, a misdemeanor, where the proof supported the indictment.</SPAN></P>

The conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal, and petitioner applied to the court for leave to file a petition for a writ of error coram nobis. The court denied the application, finding that all of petitioner's claims were either meritless or procedurally barred because he could have, but failed to raise them on direct appeal. The court noted that there was no necessity for a presentence report prior to sentencing in petitioner's case because it was not requested by the circuit judge, as provided by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-9(3)(a). Further, his argument that the punishment of felony murder by death was unconstitutional was presented without standing because petitioner was convicted not of felony murder, but of violating Miss.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder after she killed the welfare department caseworker. Defendant shot and killed the caseworker after the caseworker told her that she was unable to visit the child that had been taken from her custody and that the baby she was carrying would also be removed from her custody when it was born. The circuit court refused to allow defendant to introduce the testimony of the two psychologists who would have testified that, because of defendant's emotional background, she was unable to form the malice necessary to a murder charge, and therefore could be guilty of no more than manslaughter. The circuit court instructed the jury as to manslaughter and murder. The jury found defendant guilty of murder. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant had not raised an insanity defense. The determination of the ultimate fact of murder or manslaughter was thus left to the jury and was not subject to expert opinion testimony. Therefore, evidence showing that defendant acted in the heat of passion and without malice because of a mental abnormality was not relevant to the inquiry of whether defendant committed manslaughter or murder.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the validity of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-65 (Chapter 576, Mississippi Laws 1974), under which he was indicted, and the sufficiency of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The girl's uncle testified that he saw defendant on top of the girl in the middle of the night trying to force himself upon the girl with his sex organ in his hand. A physical examination of the girl showed abrasion and blood, and the examining doctor opined that there had been an attempt of rape made upon the girl. Defendant testified that he was in bed with the girl but that he had done nothing to her. The court on appeal first found that defendant's argument that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional was without merit and that, even if there were a basis to that contention, defendant could not complain because he escaped a death penalty verdict. The court next found that the statute did not unconstitutionally discriminate against males because it was the victim, not the accused, who had to be a female under the statute. Finally, the court found that there was no proof of penetration and that the State did not show that the girl's private parts were &quot;lacerated or torn&quot; because the court found that the proof supported a finding of penetration as well as a tearing of the girl's private parts.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the contested judgment and remanded the cause to conduct the hearing on the granddaughter's petitions that had been timely filed. The court ruled that the statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 91-1-15 (Supp. 1981), created a cause of action and remedy for the granddaughter as a descent of her illegitimate mother who wished to assert a claim against the decedent's estate. The court concluded that the granddaughter possessed a remedy that was contingent upon proving that the decedent fathered the illegitimate mother. The court held that the granddaughter's action asserting her claim as heir was timely filed based on the date of the decedent's death. The court ruled that, based on that date, a three year period of limitation applied under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 91-1-15(3)(d)(ii)(2) (Supp. 1983).

The court held that: (1) &sect; 97-29-59 was constitutional; (2) there was no error in overruling defendant's motion for mental examination because defendant offered no evidence to show probable cause that he was incapable of assisting defense counsel; (3) the amendment to the indictment to delete words indicating that defendant forced the victim to perform the unnatural act was one of form and properly allowed; (4) defendant waived his motion for directed verdict at the close of the State's case by introducing evidence; (5) the testimony of the victim was accepted by the jury and the verdict was sustained by the evidence; and (6) the trial judge would not be found to have committed or abused his discretion when he imposed a sentence within statutory limits.</SPAN></P>

The lower court's ruling had reversed the finding of respondent county board of supervisors and held that under a lease between the parties and Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 27-31-1, 57-3-33 (1972), a project for the company to build a bottling plant in the county was exempt from ad valorem taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the project was exempt from ad valorem taxation. In withdrawing its former opinion, the court found that the entire project was, subject to the limitation of Miss. Const. art. 7, &sect; 182, expressly exempt from ad valorem taxation by the industrial development statutes for the statutory 10 year period. The entire industrial enterprise was authorized by law and the law expressly authorized the county to lease the project to the company upon the stated terms and conditions. The statutes expressly provided for ad valorem tax exemptions. The court held that covenants set forth in the lease agreement designed to ensure that all real and personal property comprising the project would be fully exempt were authorized by law and were fully valid and binding. Levy of the ad valorem assessment by the board in violation of the express terms of the lease could not be upheld. The court concluded that the lower court correctly held that the assessment was erroneous and in violation of the lease contract. The lease contract recognized the tax exemption and the county bound itself not to take any affirmative action that would cause assessment of ad valorem taxes on the project.</SPAN></P>

Various claims of error, such as lack of jurisdiction, use of certain statements, a juror's violation of his oath, and the consideration of improper aggravating circumstances, were res judicata. Other claims, such as the denial of fair trial due to community prejudice, failure to excuse a prejudiced juror, the use of inflammatory photographs, and an improper closing argument, were not preserved either at trial or on appeal; thus, they were barred from consideration under the petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the crime of sexual battery in violation of &sect; 97-3-95, and he appealed. Defendant contended that the circuit court erred by allowing the prosecutrix--his daughter--to testify about incidences of sexual battery between her and her father, which occurred prior to the act alleged in the indictment; and that &sect; 97-3-95 was unconstitutional in that it was overreaching, overbroad, and placed an unfair burden on defendant, denying him due process of law. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the circuit court did not err in admitting evidence of the other incidences of sexual battery. Although it was the general rule that in criminal prosecutions evidence, which showed that the accused was guilty of the commission of other offenses at other times was not admissible, evidence of other crimes was admissible, which showed or tended to show prior offenses of the same kind committed by defendant with the prosecuting witness. The court further held that the statute at issue was unambiguous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the election was held, appellee was declared the winner. Upon appellant's judicial review request, a special tribunal consisting of election commissioners and a circuit court judge denied the appeal. Appellant contended that certain absentee ballots were invalid because the statutory absentee balloting procedures were not followed and because the metal ballot boxes were not secured and locked as required by state statutes. The court determined that although judicial review of an election was permitted under &sect; 23-3-51 Mississippi Code Annotated (1972), the Supreme Court of Mississippi refused to review facts as found by a special tribunal where three of the commissioners concurred in the presiding judge's findings. The court found that the registrar's practice of delivering the absentee ballots personally to voters was not a violation of &sect; 23-9-605 Mississippi Code Annotated (Supp. 1983) inasmuch as the statute failed to require the use of the postal service in order to send the ballots. The court held that in the absence of fraud or tampering, the personal delivery of the ballots was permissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislators brought a declaratory judgment action against appellee attorney general claiming that their concurrent service on state boards and commissions did not violate the article on the separation of power and that statutes providing for such service were constitutional. The circuit court found such service violative of Miss. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the circuit court in part and reversed in part. The court reasoned that there were no exceptions to the mandate that the powers of government be held and exercised in three separate and distinct departments and that no person holding office in any one department should have or exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others. The court held that the governor was entitled to establish within the executive department committees to assist him in the performance of his executive function and that the power to appoint executive subordinates was exclusive and legislative encroachment was prohibited by the language of Miss. Const. art. I. The court further held that the confirmation power of the senate was not invasive of the power vested in the executive department.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and the father were engaged in a custody dispute over their 19-month old child. The lower court granted custody to the mother solely on the reasoning that there existed a presumption that a child of young and tender years should be awarded to the mother and that such presumption was not rebutted. The instant appeal ensued, with the father arguing the &quot;tender age rule&quot; in custody awards was violative of the father's right to equal protection of the law under U.S. Const. amend XIV. The court determined that the &quot;tender age rule&quot; was not the proper standard for custody evaluations. Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 93-13-1 (1972) stated that neither parent had a right paramount to the other. The proper standard was the best interest of the child. However, having reviewed the record, the court found that the lower court applied the standard of best interest and welfare of the child to the custody decision. The proper result was reached, although based upon improper reasoning.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the facts, including psychiatric evaluations and the record of the judge's discussion of the guilty plea with petitioner, showed that petitioner knew right from wrong, was able to aid his counsel, had average or better intelligence, was without psychosis, and that there was no reason for the sentencing to judge to hold any separate hearing. The facts also showed that petitioner's counsel was ineffective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that &sect; 112 required that a taxing authority impose the same percentage ratio of assessed value to true value to all taxable property and could not assign a different assessment ratio to different species or classes of property. The trial court concluded that the utilization of different ratios of assessed value to true value in regard to personal property as opposed to real property was unconstitutional and in violation of &sect; 112. The court stated the classification of property for tax-related purposes had to have as its ultimate goal the inclusion of all taxable property on the assessment rolls and arriving at the true value of each item of property. Once the true value was determined, a uniform and equal ratio of assessment had to be applied thereto. Therefore, the trial court was correct in holding that the utilization of different ratios of assessed value to true value in regard to personal property as opposed to real property was unconstitutional. Appellees filed a cross appeal seeking an abatement of their assessments.The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in utilizing the method that he chose for that purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder arising out of a robbery of a store owner. His original death sentence was vacated by a federal district court due to a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. At resentencing proceedings, defendant was again sentenced to death. The court found no error in the jury instructions. Combining the aggravating factors of robbery and pecuniary gain into one instruction when they could have been presented as two factors probably favored defendant rather than prejudicing him. Certain requested instructions about mitigating factors were properly refused because they were adequately addressed by other instructions. The sentencing court was not required to give a &quot;mercy&quot; instruction; thus, it was not an abuse of discretion to refuse to give it. The court found that the death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty in similar cases. Finally, the application of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101 did not violate Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-1 (1972) or the Ex Post Facto Clause because the provision merely changed the death penalty procedure but did not affect the crime or its punishment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant voluntarily made the comments and the conversation was not instigated by any law enforcement officer. The court also held that a person who intentionally set fire to a building with or without knowledge that it was occupied could properly be charged with capital murder if indeed that fire resulted in the death of one of the occupants of that building. In reversing defendant's death sentence, the court held that when the circuit judge in the first trial in open court sustained the defense motion and sentenced defendant to life imprisonment, the question of maximum punishment was thereupon irrevocably settled and defendant could not be sentenced to death at his retrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city adopted an annexation ordinance proposing to annex into the municipality a certain area of land, part of which lay in the municipal school district and part of which lay in the county school district. When the city petitioned before the chancery court for approval of the annexation, the county school district filed a petition with the city requesting a referendum on the issue, and the county board of supervisors filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment seeking a construction of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-1-59, naming the two school districts as defendants. The chancery court held that &sect; 21-1-59 was inapplicable and that, under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 37-7-611, upon the approval by the chancery court of the annexation order, the area would automatically become a part of the municipal school district and be severed from the county school district. The board of county supervisors and the county school district appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-1-59, by its clear language, was special legislation that applied only to Jones County, South Carolina. Because Jones County was not a party to the action, section 21-1-59 was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's claim that the trial court erred in restricting defendant's cross-examination of a State's witness concerning the witness's prior convictions and false statements. The court further held that the trial court properly admitted an aggravating circumstance during the sentencing phase of the trial a record of defendant's armed robbery conviction committed one day after the murder.

While later returning with the freezer, an argument erupted that was predicated on the former wife's socializing with other men. Defendant left and, upon returning, broke through the door and grabbed his former wife by the hair, stating that he was going to cut her head off. He then proceeded to cut her with a pocket knife before he was later stopped by third parties. Upon review, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, holding that defendant waived an attack on the constitutionality of the statute under which he was convicted, Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 97-3-7(2) (Supp. 1982), by failing to raise such question at trial. The court also held that because there was no evidence to the contrary that the wounds inflicted upon the victim were anything other than serious, with great risk of death, there was no error in the refusal to instruct the jury on simple assault.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court admitted the murder weapon into evidence after it concluded that the police officers obtained the gun without reference to defendant's involuntary confession. The circuit court also removed a prospective juror unable to vote for the death penalty, denied defendant's request for a new trial based on mental incompetency, admitted truck company records and crime-scene photographs, and refused jury instructions authorizing convictions for lesser offenses. On review, defendant contended admission of the murder weapon was violative of the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine. The court affirmed, concluding that: (1) the murder weapon was properly admitted based on the evidence at trial and the officers' testimony; (2) the juror was properly excused for cause; (3) defendant failed to offer expert or lay witness testimony relevant to his competency to stand trial; (4) a computer print-out was competent evidence of a business record; (5) the admission of photographs was within the discretion of the circuit judge; and (6) the jury unanimously found aggravating circumstances that were sufficient to impose the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

The issue was whether the alleged heir's action was barred by the six-year statute of limitations as provided in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-49 (1972).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the decedent died, the alleged heir filed a petition to have herself declared one his heirs. The alleged heir was born outside of the decedent's marriage to his legal wife, and no formal acknowledgment or paternity was established prior to his death. The alleged heir filed her petition within two years after the decedent died, but more than 17 years after she turned 21 years of age. The decedent's legitimate son filed a motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds, which the chancery court granted; it held that the alleged heir should have brought her petition within six years of her turning 21. On review the court reversed. It held that the action was not a paternity action but a separate statutory proceeding to have oneself declared an heir that did not require a prior paternity determination. The court held that one could not be somebody's heir until that person actually died; living people do not have heirs and the possible future heirs do not have a claim to the still-living person's property. Since the alleged heir's cause of action and her potential property rights in the estate did not ripen until her putative father actually died, her petition was timely filed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the County Court of DeSoto (Mississippi), which convicted him of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, and sentenced him to imprisonment and a fine. Defendant claimed that he had been entrapped, that illegally seized evidence was improperly admitted, that forensic testimony was improperly allowed, and that certain instructions were improperly refused.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An informant had arranged with the police to attempt to buy marijuana from defendant. After defendant arrived at a prearranged meeting and showed marijuana to the informant, the police arrested him and seized bags of marijuana by reaching into the back of defendant's car where the bags were in plain view. The court held that defendant's entrapment instruction was properly denied because the evidence showed there was no entrapment: defendant knew where to get marijuana, obtained it, and was caught selling it. The court also rejected his contention that the marijuana evidence should have been suppressed because it was taken from his car after he was under arrest. Probable cause justified stopping the vehicle, a search of every part of the vehicle was justified, and in any event the marijuana was in plain view. The State's forensic expert was skilled in plant identification and allowing his identification of the marijuana was not error. The fact that the jury might infer from the State's failure to call a witness that the witness would have testified adversely to the State was a matter to be mentioned in defense counsel's summation, and was not a subject for an instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died intestate without children or lineal descendents. She was survived by the sister, who died testate about 10 months after the decedent passed away. In his petition to notify of heirship in the decedent's estate, the nephew claimed that he was the legitimate son of the decedent's brother, who died while committed in a mental institution. The nephew asserted that the decedent's brother wed his mother in a marriage ceremony. Appellees asserted that the decedent's brother did not have any children. After a hearing, the chancellor found that the nephew was the illegitimate son of the decedent's brother and that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 91-1-15 (1972), which barred an illegitimate child from inheriting through his intestate father unless the child was acknowledged, was unconstitutional in light of a recent United States Supreme Court holding and that the Court's holding was to be given retroactive application. On appeal, the court held that the chancellor erred in deciding the case on a theory not in issue under the pleadings. The nephew had not asserted that he was the illegitimate son of the decedent's brother nor had he attacked the constitutionality of &sect; 91-1-15.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The natural parents voluntarily gave up three of their children to a county welfare department when they found that they were unable to properly care for them. One of their daughters was successfully placed with the foster parents. The foster parents later petitioned the court to terminate the natural parents' parental rights so that they could adopt the child. The involved county welfare departments opposed the petition because the natural parents had maintained contact with the child and their financial situation had improved. The trial court found that the foster parents had shown by a preponderance of the evidence and by substantial evidence that the termination petition should be granted. In reversing, the court held that the trial court had clearly relied upon an unconstitutional and impermissible standard of proof. The standard of proof in a termination of parental rights action brought under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 93-15-109 (Supp. 1981) was that of clear and convincing evidence.The trial court's findings were manifestly wrong, as was the decree terminating the natural parents' rights that arose from those findings.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant had a history of schizophrenia, but understood the difference between right and wrong. In affirming the jury verdict finding defendant guilty of capital murder for the shooting death of a police officer, the court held that defendant's insanity defense failed because, under the M'Naghten rule, the jury properly found defendant criminally responsible for the murder. The court found closing arguments were not so inflammatory as to warrant reversal although it was not proper for the prosecution to suggest wrongly that defendant would one day be free. The court held the jury was entitled to find that the murder was &quot;especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel&quot; and that it hindered the lawful exercise of the enforcement of laws under Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 99-19-101(5)(g) and (h). However, in reversing the death sentence, the court found that defendant suffered schizophrenia of a paranoid type. After finding that the jury failed to consider the mitigating factors of Miss.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was the daughter of defendant's girlfriend and was under the age of 12 at the time of the rape. The victim's testimony regarding the rape was consistent with the medical testimony that was introduced. The victim also testified that defendant had threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the incident. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting hearsay testimony regarding the child statements about the rape. There was sufficient evidence to support the conviction and defendant's motion for a directed verdict was properly denied. The court also held that the jury was properly instructed in accordance with Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-65 (1981) because since the witness was under the age of 12 the state was not required to prove penetration. Finally, because the case against defendant proceeded to trial as a rape not justifying the death penalty, the trial judge was not required to send the jury back to the jury room for the purpose of returning a verdict of life imprisonment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The woman was born on January 7, 1940, and asserted she was first told decedent was her father when she was approximately three or four years of age. The decedent was married prior to the woman's birth and the son was the couple's only child. After the decedent's death, the woman filed her petition for heirship. The woman was 38-years-old at the time of decedent's death. In dismissing the petition, the chancery court found the action was barred by the six-year statute of limitations of Miss. Code Ann. 15-1-49 after the woman's 27th birthday, six years after she reached her majority. On appeal, the woman contended the six-year statute of limitations was inapplicable because her action involved a petition to determine heirship pursuant to &sect; 91-1-27 and was not a paternity suit under the authority of &sect; 93-9-29. The court affirmed the dismissal because the woman's remedy or right of action became barred six years after she became 21-years-old.</SPAN></P>

The grand jury was properly recalled by a judge rather than the district attorney. It was unnecessary for the judge to recall the grand jury each day the district attorney desired to meet during the term. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a continuance prior to trial because there was no proof in support of the motion that counsel had insufficient time to prepare, as was claimed. Evidence that defendant raped the victim before killing her was properly admitted although he was not charged with the crime of rape because the proof was part of the res gestae and also a possible motive for the crime charged. Defendant failed to properly preserve his objection to the proof of his two prior convictions for the habitual offender element of sentencing, so the argument was waived. The accomplice's testimony was corroborated on more than one detail, making it sufficient to sustain the verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the sentencing judge improperly considered an invalid foreign conviction for escape from a penitentiary as a basis for enhancement of punishment under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-81 (Supp. 1981). Defendant asserted that the escape conviction was unconstitutional and invalid because it resulted from a guilty plea that was not knowing or voluntary. Noting that a constitutionally defective conviction could not be used for the purpose of a habitual offender statute, the court determined that if the conviction on its face made a proper showing that a defendant's plea of guilty was both knowing and voluntary the conviction could be used for the enhancement of punishment under &sect; 99-19-81. The court ruled that the trial court properly considered defendant's escape conviction because the record of the conviction showed on its face that defendant's guilty plea had been knowing and voluntary. The court further ruled that any attack on a conviction from another state that went beyond the face of the record of the conviction had to be prosecuted in a separate proceeding and that, until vacated, the conviction could be used for purposes of the habitual offender statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because of a decline in the deer population in a particular area, the Commission on Wildlife Conservation promulgated a regulation that prohibited deer hunting with the aid of dogs in that area for a particular period of time. The hunters claimed that the regulation was promulgated without authority, was arbitrary and capricious, and violated Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 49-7-31, 49-37-37, and 49-7-45 (1981). The trial court granted the hunters' petition for a writ of certiorari and declared the regulation void, holding that the regulation was not supported by substantial evidence. Because the regulation had expired prior to the appeal, the hunters claimed that the issue of its validity was moot. On appeal, the court held that the issue was not moot because it was capable of repetition yet evading review. The court reasoned that if it refused to address the issue based on mootness it would never be resolved because of the short duration of such regulations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim fell from a scaffold while installing roof drains on the authority's airport terminal. He filed a negligence action against the authority in federal district court. The district court granted the authority's motion for summary judgment based on immunity. The appellate court certified two questions to the court: Did the omission in the Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 61-3-1 et seq. (1958), of any provision for immunity in tort continue in effect the rule that an airport authority has no immunity from suit arising out of proprietary functions? If so, were allegations of supplying equipment for maintenance purposes sufficient to describe such functions? The court answered both questions in the affirmative. The court held that the words &quot;public and governmental functions&quot; in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 61-3-83 (1972) did not make the authority's function &quot;governmental&quot; as that word was used to determine immunity. Because the Municipal Airport Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 61-5-1 et seq. (1958), specifically granted immunity for proprietary acts, the omission of the immunity provision from the Act meant that the authority was not entitled to immunity for proprietary functions.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motion to suppress evidence taken from his apartment and in admitting the evidence in the trial. The court determined that the police officers' original justification for entry into defendant's apartment fell within the &quot;exigent circumstances&quot; doctrine. The fact that the actual physical taking of the items into police custody was effectuated by an evidence technician, rather than by the first officers to view the objects, was not significant.

The court held that the inference submitted to the jury by the instruction accorded with due process because the evidence was sufficient for a rational juror to infer that it was more-likely-than-not beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the burglary from fact that he was in possession of shoes taken in the burglary a few blocks away and provided no reasonable explanation for such possession consistent with innocence.

The court concluded that &sect; 11-1-17 precluded all parties in a case from having a complete and final disposition of their rights in a trial forum provided by the organic law. The court found that the intended result of &sect; 11-1-17 could be achieved by adopting Miss. Sup. Ct. R. 47, which provided for a writ of mandamus because, among others, it would not force a party to artificially appeal a case that had not been tried, and the rule fixed a definite period of time within which an applicant could obtain a final decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was previously convicted of separate charges of grand larceny in Alabama and Oklahoma. Defendant was later indicted for the current crime and charged as a habitual offender. Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the habitual offender statute was invalid. When defendant entered his plea in the trial court, he specifically reserved the right to contest and appeal the habitual offender portion of the indictment. Defendant argued that Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 99-19-81 (Supp. 1981) did not set forth a procedure for determining and adjudicating defendant as a habitual offender. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in sentencing defendant as a habitual offender. The court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 99-19-81 constituted cruel and inhuman treatment. Because the sentence did not exceed statutory limits, it did not constitute cruel and inhuman treatment. The court ruled that all cases tried in the future involving &sect; 99-19-81, the habitual offenders statute, should be tried pursuant to Rule 6.04 of the Mississippi Uniform Criminal Rules of Circuit Court Practice (1972).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient alleged that she discovered a pea-sized lump in her left breast in October 1972. The doctor diagnosed her condition as mastitis and she was requested to return in three to four months. In December 1976 a second doctor took a pap smear of her left breast, which was suspicious of malignant cells markedly atypical, suggesting malignancy. Her doctor told her that the tests were not very reliable and he would not entertain the thought that she had breast cancer based on the one determination. The patient was admitted to the hospital May 11, 1978, and a biopsy was performed May 12, 1978. The biopsy revealed carcinoma of the left breast and a radical mastectomy of the left breast was performed on May 13, 1978. The patient filed suit on March 19, 1980. In reversing the judgment of the trial court, the court held that the action was not barred by the two-year statute of limitation provided in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-36 (1981 Supp.). The patient had filed her suit within two years after learning she had cancer so she was entitled to a trial on her declaration which charged a series of negligent acts or omissions beginning in 1976.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter sought a declaration that she was the sole heir of her mother's estate. The grandson contended that he was entitled to half the estate by representation as the only heir of the deceased son. The daughter pled the ten-year adverse possession statute as a defense under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-7 (1972). The trial court sua sponte held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 91-1-15 (1972), which only permitted illegitimate children to take through their mother was unconstitutional, and awarded the grandson a one-half interest in the estate. On review, the court found that the parties, in their pleadings, should have hit the issues of illegitimacy, unconstitutionality, and the statute of limitations head on like two wild rams during the mating season. Unfortunately, they did not. Section 91-1-15 was not pled by either party, nor was its constitutionality attacked. Similarly, the daughter did not plead the six-year general statute of limitations under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-49 (1972).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board passed an ordinance pursuant to Miss.

On appeal, the court affirmed the decree. The chancery court had jurisdiction over the action because the injunction was sought to prevent interference with the exercise of property rights under a void ordinance.

The court affirmed, determining that the officers were not acting illegally when they took defendant and his companion into custody. The trial court's finding that defendant's confession was voluntary was supported by substantial evidence where defendant was allowed to use the phone while in custody, was not physically abused or psychologically coerced, and was informed of his rights sufficiently before he gave any inculpatory statement. The trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motion for a mistrial because the State's failure to disclose a statement made by a witness regarding a stolen weapon did not prejudice defendant.

On appeal, the court stated that the verdict of the jury was more than justified by the evidence and that under the circumstances defendant was fortunate not to have been sentenced to the death penalty. Defendant asserted that discrimination in the selection of the foreman of the grand jury existed at the time he was indicted because black foremen were systematically not appointed in a discriminatory manner. In defendant's case a grand jury adequately representing the population of the county where the murder happened indicted defendant and a petit jury also adequately comprised with respect to the races of the county convicted defendant. Under those undisputed facts no theory could have been reasonably justified upon which to predicate a holding that defendant had suffered any prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant's term, the legislature passed two appropriation bills for the purpose of providing assistance and services to handicapped children. Subsequently, the state department of public welfare (department) entered into several contracts with nonprofit corporations for the purpose of assisting needy and handicapped children. The department also entered into a contract with a profit corporation from which defendant received compensation. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the evidence supported a conviction. The court rejected defendant's argument that the state appropriation bills did not &quot;authorize&quot; the contract with the corporation for purposes of &sect; 97-11-19. The court concluded that no payment of state funds under any of the contracts would have been legally permissible without the passage of the bills. The court found irrelevant defendant's contention that &sect; 97-11-19 was unconstitutionally vague in failing to give reasonable notice of the extent of the prohibited &quot;indirect interest&quot; because the record revealed that defendant had a direct interest in the contract. The court also rejected defendant's claim of immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted in a justice's court for a violation of Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 97-15-13 (Supp. 1980), which proscribed racing, hunting, or shooting in a certain area. The inmate filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the Circuit Court of Neshoba County (Mississippi) to require appellee justice judge to certify the record in the cause to the circuit court. The inmate appealed from the dismissal of his petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole question presented was whether Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 97-15-13 (1972) (as amended) was a local and private law in violation of &sect; 87 of the Mississippi Constitution (1890) and was unconstitutional in that it was vague and indefinite. The inmate contended that the words &quot;unless permission was granted within a county wherein highway 15 and I20 intersect&quot; made &sect; 97-15-13 local and private in nature and was vague and indefinite, thereby rendering &sect; 97-15-13&nbsp;unconstitutional. On appeal from the dismissal of the inmate's petition, the court held that it was common knowledge and the court took judicial notice of the fact that Mississippi State Highway 15 and Interstate Highway I20 intersected only in Newton County, Mississippi. The violation charged and the conviction of the inmate occurred in Neshoba County, Mississippi. Therefore, the provision, which the inmate complained about, did not relate to or affect him. The court concluded that in the case sub judice the part of &sect; 97-15-13, was unconstitutional, and it ordered the offensive language stricken from the act. But it declared that the remaining portion of &sect; 97-15-13 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor was injured when he thrust his arm through a glass door while leaving an elementary school.

It sustained the contractors' plea in bar and dismissed the actions. A motion for reconsideration was overruled. The minor and his parents appealed from that judgment, which was affirmed. Section 15-1-41 required that a claim alleging negligence in the construction of an improvement to real property had to be brought within 10 years of the date that the work was accepted. The court noted that those persons owning or in possession of property had the ability to remove hazards from the premises. Furthermore, there was the possibility that they may have neglected, abused, or improper modified the improvement. Therefore, the court found that &sect; 15-1-41 was a valid exercise of legislative power and that it did not interfere with vested rights. It also found that &sect; 15-1-41 comported with Miss.

The lower court also determined that the election procedure was subject to the Act. The individuals then filed a petition to enforce the mandate of the court. The court determined that the lower court erred in finding that the election procedures were subject to the Act. However, the rest of the decision was affirmed. The prior judgment of the court was the law of the case. When the case was remanded, the lower court was required to call an election under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 37-7-203.

By that time, the adoption agency had placed the child for adoption with the adoptive parents, who filed a cross-petition for adoption against the natural parents. The trial court decreed adoption of the child unto the natural parents. The adoption agency and adoptive parents appealed, and the court reversed, holding that the testimony in regard to undue influence and duress was less than clear and convincing. The court held that the trial court's finding of undue influence was contrary to the overwhelming weight of the testimony and manifestly in error. The court found that both natural parents executed surrender forms in strict compliance with Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had already been convicted in the City's municipal court and a county court.

He did state that he had presented the grounds to a federal court by filed complaint and that the federal court was abstaining pending the outcome of the decision of the Mississippi courts. On appeal, the court pointed out that defendant named no specific federal court, nor was there a copy of an order of a federal court &quot;abstaining&quot; in the premises of the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To show that the woman was not the illegitimate daughter of the decedent, the claimants introduced certified copies of a marriage license and a birth certificate showing that the woman was born to the couple whose marriage was shown by the certificate. Considerable testimony suggested that the decedent was the father of the woman and that he freely admitted that fact during his lifetime. The court reversed the judgment finding that the woman was the child of the decedent and was entitled to inherit his interest in the property. Even though the woman contended that the man married to her mother was not her father, the proof was uncontradicted that her mother's husband had raised her along with her four younger siblings after her birth. The woman failed to meet her burden of first proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the husband of her mother was not her father before she could be shown to be the daughter of the decedent. The testimony of her mother that the decedent was the father and that her husband had no sexual relations with her for three years prior to the woman's birth was not strong enough, standing alone, to rebut the presumption that the husband was her father.</SPAN></P>

After an investigation, the committee found that there was reasonable ground to believe that the attorney was guilty of unprofessional conduct and issued a private reprimand.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admittedly bought a pistol. A prosecution witness testified that defendant was carrying the weapon in another person's automobile. At one point, defendant got out of the car with the gun partially concealed in his pants belt. Certified copies of defendant's prior felony convictions in Oklahoma, including first-degree rape, assault and battery with intent to kill, and escape from a state penitentiary, were introduced into evidence in the single stage trial. On appeal, defendant asserted that &sect; 99-19-83 violated the federal and state constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. Rejecting defendant's double enhancement rationale as unconvincing, the court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 99-19-83 as written and applied. Specifically, because defendant's sentence did not exceed statutory limits, it was not cruel or unusual punishment. Further, the introduction of the prior felony convictions in a single stage proceeding was proper because the Mississippi Uniform Criminal Rules of Circuit Court Practice 6.04 (1979), which provided for a bifurcated trial on the issues of guilt and recidivism, was not adopted until about one month after defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 99-19-83 (Supp. 1980), he was mandatorily sentenced to life imprisonment. He appealed his conviction and his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the State failed to prove assault as a matter of law, the evidence was insufficient, and he was unconstitutionally denied a jury trial on the issue of his two prior felony convictions. Defendant brought a rifle out of his house, aimed it at a police officer and pulled the trigger. He contended he could not be convicted because the rifle was inoperable and would not fire. There was sufficient evidence that he pulled the trigger. To support a criminal charge, it was not necessary that the rifle either be loaded or operable. More serious was the argument that defendant had a constitutional right to a jury trial on the issue of whether he was an habitual criminal for having had two prior felony convictions. The substantive charge was aggravated assault upon a law officer under &sect; 97-3-7(2), as charged in the indictment; this appropriately advised defendant that if he were convicted of the primary charge, he was subject to being sentenced as an habitual offender under &sect; 99-19-83. The primary charge of aggravated assault against a law officer was properly tried by the jury, and it was not necessary that the issue of prior convictions be submitted to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Some 19 months after indictment, defendant was tried and convicted for the crime of armed robbery. On appeal, defendant contended that Mississippi Code Annotated (MSA) &sect; 99-17-1 (Supp. 1980), as amended, denied his right to a speedy trial as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article III, &sect; 26 of the Constitution of the State of Mississippi. Despite recognizing the State's contention that matters other than jurisdiction not raised in the trial court may not be raised for the first time on appeal, the court nonetheless held that MSA &sect; 99-17-1 was constitutional, assuming that such issue had been properly presented in the trial court. However, such issue was not necessary to a determination of the case because the State did not act in bad faith in delaying the trial because it reasonably and diligently pursued defendant's request for a speedy trial. Further, defendant suffered no prejudice by the delay even though he claimed that he was unable to locate a mysterious witness on his behalf whom he purportedly knew only by the first name of &quot;Sandy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied a motion to suppress an in-court identification based in part on an out-of-court photo array identification and a lineup held without counsel in the investigatory phase of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The robbery victim described the robber as having a moustache and identified the moustached defendant in a photo array. The victim later identified the clean-shaven defendant in a lineup. A policeman and a taxicab driver saw defendant in the days before and after the robbery and testified that he shaved in the interim. On appeal, the court held that defendant was not entitled to counsel until after he was charged. The court looked at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the photo array and held that the array was unduly suggestive because defendant was the only subject with a moustache. The court then applied a five-factor test and looked at the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness's degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description, the level of certainty at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and the confrontation. The court found that the witness saw defendant at a close distance in a well-lighted office with an excellent opportunity to observe defendant and to impress his appearance upon the victim's mind. The court held that the in-court identification was reliable despite the photo array.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a consortium of civil rights groups, led boycotts against appellees' businesses in the late 1960s. Appellees claimed that the boycotts were a restraint on trade and were part of a conspiracy to injure and ruin appellees' businesses.

The supreme court held: 1) appellees did not establish case against certain appellants, 2) domestic non-profit corporation was erroneously included as a judgment defendant, 3) attorneys' fees were improper because anti-boycott statute could not be applied retroactively, and 4) appellees suffered some damages resulting from the boycott, but damages award was excessive under the evidence presented.</SPAN></P>

The statutes set out a procedure for payment of part of the gasoline tax collected under state law to counties and municipalities. In Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 27-5-101, distribution of the taxes was made to counties. Distribution was made to municipalities under Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 27-5-103. The cities alleged that the city residents were by their taxes, having to pay a much larger amount for street upkeep and other municipal expenses than was paid by rural citizens of the counties, who had less burdensome expenses for road maintenance due to the amount the counties received from the distribution of the taxes. In addition to the adjudication, the cities alternatively sought an injunction requiring the state to pay to the cities their fair, just, and reasonable share of the gasoline taxes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former husband sought review of a decree of the Chancery Court of Jackson County (Mississippi), which found him in contempt for his failure to pay medical bills previously decreed by the chancery court. The decree ordered him to continue paying alimony to appellee former wife as ordered in their original divorce decree under the alimony statute,&nbsp;Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 93-5-23 (1972), as it existed prior to the 1979 amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the husband challenged the constitutionality of Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 93-5-23 (1972), as it existed prior to the 1979 amendment. He asserted that it was unconstitutional because it made no provision for alimony payable to a husband. The court noted that not only did the husband, in his pleadings related to the original decree and several subsequent proceedings based thereon, fail to attack the constitutionality of the alimony statute, but he also sought no alimony for himself. The husband's challenge to &sect; 93-5-23, as it existed prior to its amendment in 1979, on constitutional grounds was untimely because he voluntarily consented to the decree, made no constitutional challenge when the decree was rendered, took no appeal from the decree, and made no challenge until years later when his wife sought to have him held in contempt for his failure to pay medical bills previously ordered. He lacked standing to assert the constitutionality issue where he agreed to the decree, acquiesced in it, and took no appeal when it was rendered. The court noted, however, that even if it found the statute unconstitutional, the decision would not be retrospectively applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decree and awarded the wife attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petitioners filed a petition to rezone 10.6 acres of land from single family residential to general commercial. The mayor and commissioners approved the petition. On appeal by appellee protestants, the Circuit Court of Forrest County (Mississippi) reversed the order and ordered the property to be reclassified as single family residential. The petitioners sought review. The petitioners also filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioners were a limited partnership that owned a mall and owners of the land. The mall wanted to expand to attract quality tenants and to provide additional parking. Because there was no mistake in the original zoning, the petitioners had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the character of the neighborhood had changed so as to justify the rezoning and that a public need existed for the rezoning. Upon review, the court found that the expanding of the mall and providing additional parking did not require the rezoning of the land. Thus, there was no public need for rezoning with the resultant encroachment into the residential area. The petitioners' motion to dismiss was based upon &sect; 11-51-75 Mississippi Code Annotated (1972) and asserted that the circuit court failed to acquire jurisdiction because the bill of exceptions was filed more than 10 days after the rezoning ordinance was adopted. The mayor and commissioners extended the time for preparing and filing the bill of exceptions. The court held that a board, under &sect; 11-51-75, could extend the time for filing a bill of exceptions if the order of extension was signed within 10 days of the order appealed from.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and overruled the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought to enjoin the state tax commission from accepting and approving assessment rolls from any county for the tax year 1983 unless the state tax commission equalized the assessment rolls between all of the counties of the State of Mississippi, in accordance with Miss.

The trial court granted the relief requested, provided for the assessment of property in accordance with the &quot;true value&quot; of the property, and awarded attorney's fees in favor of the taxpayers. On review, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment with regard to equalization of assessment rolls, but reversed the trial court's mandate that required the assessment of property based on &quot;true value.&quot; The court held that assessed value may be a percentage of true value. Furthermore, the court reversed the trial court's award of attorney's fees. Lastly, the court held that the trial court correctly required the state tax commission to file a master plan to assist the counties in determining the &quot;true value&quot; of taxable property by a date certain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another individual were involved in the murder of the victim, whose body was disposed of in a lake. Defendant was later arrested while driving the victim's vehicle. At the police station, defendant made several inculpatory oral and written statements about the crime. The jury returned a guilty verdict and sentenced defendant to death. On appeal, defendant raised 28 assignments of error related to the statements made to police, the evidence introduced at trial, and the jury instructions given by the trial court. Defendant also asserted that his involvement in the murder was limited to that of an accomplice, for which his sentence should be reduced to life imprisonment. The court reviewed all of the errors raised, failed to find any trial court error or abuse or any prejudice to defendant, and affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. There was overwhelming evidence that defendant was an active participant in the assault and homicide, that the robbery-murder was wanton, cruel, senseless, heinous, and atrocious, and that the sentenced imposed was not so disproportionate, wanton, or freakish when compared to other capital cases of a similar nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's conviction, the court declared the fondling statute unconstitutional because it denied equal protection of the law to males because it did not apply to females as well. Defendant sought to vacate his sentence on the grounds that if the statute was unconstitutional, his conviction was void. The court found itself confronted with the issue of whether or not to apply its prior decision invalidating the statute retroactively or prospectively. After reviewing the various federal decisions pertaining to prospective and retroactive application of an invalidated statute, the court concluded that only prospective application would apply. The conduct prohibited under the statute was nevertheless a crime, and states had a measure of freedom in determining how statutes would be applied. In this case the nature of the conduct warranted prospective application of the court's earlier decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

A hearing before the state board and the Accreditation Commission resulted in placing the county board on probation as far as accreditation was concerned. The trial court rendered judgment for the county board. On review, appellants claimed that the filing of the suit was void because the county board did not follow the mandates of Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 37-5-27 (1972) regarding the authority of the board to act at a special meeting thereof. In reversing the judgment and dismissing the suit, the court found that &sect; 37-5-27 required that the notice for a special meeting was to specify each matter of business to be transacted thereat and that at a special meeting, the county board could not transact any business not specified in the notice. The court found that the filing of the suit was discussed at a special meeting and that that matter had not been listed in the notice; thus, any action taken pursuant to the special meeting, in relation to the filing of the suit, was void.</SPAN></P>

The trial court correctly permitted the State to question defendant about whether he had engaged in prior sexual activity.

Defendant argued that &sect; 99-19-81 was not satisfied as to charge him as a habitual offender when his last conviction occurred after the date on which he was charged with feloniously selling and delivering a controlled substance. The trial court overruled the demurrer and motion. Defendant was convicted of feloniously selling and delivering a controlled substance. The trial court conducted a procedure as to defendant's previous convictions set forth in his indictment. The trial court sentenced defendant as a habitual offender under &sect; 99-19-81. Defendant appealed arguing that the trial court improperly applied &sect; 99-19-81. The court upheld the conviction. The court held that defendant was properly convicted and sentenced as a habitual offender under &sect; 99-19-81. Defendant had been previously convicted of two felonies; therefore &sect; 99-19-81 was complied therewith.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the State, on the relation of the State Medical Association and members of the State Board of Health, filed an information in the nature of a quo warranto, challenging appellant doctors' authority to serve on the Board on the grounds they were not appointed in accordance with Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-3-1 (1972). The Circuit Court, First Judicial District, Hinds County (Mississippi), entered a judgment for the State. The doctors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The relators asserted that none of the doctors had been nominated by the Association or confirmed by the legislature as required by &sect; 41-3-1. The doctors argued that &sect; 41-3-1, which provided that members of the Board were to be appointed by the governor from a list of persons nominated by the Association, unlawfully infringed on the governor's constitutional powers and was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. On appeal, the court held that pursuant to Miss. Const. &sect; 103, the only power of appointment vested in the governor was that conferred upon him by legislative enactment. By Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 7-1-5(f), 7-1-35, the governor had the power to make appointments as prescribed by law; any such appointments had to be made with the advise and consent of the legislature. Because the power to appoint the members of the Board was vested in the legislature, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-3-1 did not encroach on the governor's constitutional powers. The legislature was entitled to delegate its power to appoint members of the Board to the Association. Even so, &sect; 41-3-1 reserved to the legislature the ultimate power of confirmation, without which one could not legally hold office.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also claimed errors by the trial court in evidentiary rulings. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence .The status of a witness as an accomplice affected the weight and not the competency of the testimony; further, there was corroborating testimony by other witnesses. The jury was not required to find that defendant actually committed the homicide because Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19(2) only required his participation in a robbery with another in furtherance of which death resulted. The prosecution was entitled to comment on defendant's failure to testify because defendant argued pro se and went beyond the evidence in the record on a material point. The use of a previous conviction was proper as an aggravating circumstance even though it occurred after the charged offense and time of trial. Defendant was properly sentenced to death under the state's guidelines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with capital murder in connection with a shooting death committed during an attempted burglary. Defendant was read his Miranda rights, and he signed a confession. After a jury trial, he was convicted and sentenced to death. The supreme court affirmed the conviction. The court ruled that the trial judge properly refused to recuse himself as a relative of the victim, because he was not biased, and defendant was not prejudiced. The court ruled that defendant's confession was admissible, because police had probable cause to arrest him and because he made a knowing waiver of his rights. The court ruled that the State's use of peremptory challenges against potential black jurors was constitutional. The jury, however, was erroneously precluded from considering mitigating circumstances other than defendant's youth. The court also found the sentence excessive, because defendant, who was 16 years old, shot the victim only after being fired upon and because he did not attack the victim's unarmed wife, although he had the opportunity to do so. Thus, the court reversed the death sentence pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-105(5)(b) (Supp. 1978).</SPAN></P>

The court took judicial notice of the fact that immunization protects children against crippling and deadly diseases. The court concluded that the mandatory immunization served a compelling and overriding public interest of protecting children from dangerous diseases. The court determined that the exemption for religious beliefs violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because it required the majority of school children to be vaccinated and at the same time exposed them to the hazard of attending school with unvaccinated children.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the statute protected the citizenry from the evil of the lesser felony by imposing a greater penalty upon a homicide occurring during its commission and that the presumption of a specific intent to kill in the felony murder statute comported with due process. The court further held that the statutory language, &quot;engaged in the commission of,&quot; included the attempt to commit the constituent felony, the completed constituent felony, as well as the immediate post-felony acts of the accused so connected to the cardinal charge as to become a part of the res gestae.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus included allegations that she was indigent and unable to afford any sum of money for a bail bond. The lower court reduced her bond but refused to release her on her own recognizance. She appealed and argued that Miss. Const. of 1890 art. 3, &sect; 29 and Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-5-1 et seq. (1972) were invalid. She contended that requiring an indigent defendant to post a money bail for pretrial release violated the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that consideration of the equal protection and due process rights of indigent pretrial detainees led to the conclusion that a bail system based on monetary bail alone was unconstitutional. The court found that although the state bail system provided for release of pretrial detainees on terms other than monetary bail, the record was devoid of any consideration by the judicial officer of alternative forms of release. The court held that there was no evidence of a substantial risk of non-appearance by defendant and remanded the case to the lower court with instructions to consider other forms of pretrial release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant property owner appealed an order of the Chancery Court of the Second Judicial District of Harrison County (Mississippi), mandatorily enjoining him to connect with water lines of complaint, the D'Iberville Water and Sewer District, and also ordering him to pay the minimum monthly service charges from the time he was eligible for connection to the system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The water and sewer district was formed, bonds were issued, and a water system was constructed, with a sewer system to be constructed later. The bonds were to be paid from the fees collected from connected users of the system. The district established a minimum fee that would be charged to all property owners within the district. The property owner in this case refused the connection and refused to pay the minimum monthly charge. The district brought this action to collect the debt and for an injunction requiring the property owner to connect to the system. The trial court granted relief and the court affirmed on the property owner's appeal. The court held that the establishment of a mandatory water and sewer system was a valid exercise of police power by the state and local governments for the protection of public health. Based on precedent from the Mississippi Supreme Court, the fees for such a system were not considered a tax. The assessment of the fee was valid because the property owner benefitted from the system even though he had not been connected to it. An injunction was an appropriate remedy because the probable injuries to the district were substantial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An attorney was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the United States, and a judge, without notice to the State Bar, issued a fiat directing the chancery court to issue a temporary writ enjoining the State Bar from filing a certified copy of the judgment of conviction with the Supreme Court of Mississippi. The court dissolved the temporary injunction, and abated the injunction proceedings in the lower court pending further action. The attorney requested a rehearing, contending that the order was without adequate process and notice and did not afford him a reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard in opposition to the State Bar's action. The court denied the petition, holding that the action of the lower court in enjoining and prohibiting the State Bar from filing a certified copy of the conviction amounted to a usurpation of the powers and duties exclusively vested in the court and could not be allowed to stand. The court had the inherent power to discipline attorneys who practiced in Mississippi under Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 73-3-301 (1978 Supp.).</SPAN></P>

The court held that the failure to comply with &sect; 99-17-3 was reversible error. The court also held that the circuit court erred when it allowed the State's psychologist and psychiatrist to testify to statements made by defendant during their examinations of defendant regarding the history of the events leading to his wife's death because the admission of the statements violated defendant's constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. The court found that the circuit court's error in allowing the psychologist and psychiatrist to testify to the statements was harmless because defendant's experts and defendant himself had already given essentially the same history when they testified before the State's experts.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled defendant motion to quash the indictment on the ground that the indictment was void because black foremen and females were systematically excluded from the grand jury. Defendant was convicted, and the court affirmed. The court noted a stipulation as to ratio in black and white population in the area based on the census, and held that defendant failed to make out a prima facie case of discrimination in the selection of the grand jury foreman. The court also held that the trial judge appointed a foreman from a valid pool. Specifically, the non-discriminatory Mississippi jury selection method, the &quot;random&quot; method found in Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 13-5-2 (Supp. 1978), was complied with in selecting the grand jury.

They unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 37-103-23 and then filed an action to recover for what they alleged had been unconstitutionally charged against them. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the complaint on the ground of sovereign immunity and res judicata, and the students appealed, arguing, inter alia, that authority was given to the university to sue and be sued under &sect; 5 of Chapter XIX, Laws of Mississippi 1878. The court affirmed, holding that the State and its subdivisions and agencies were not subject to suit unless made so by statute. The State could not be made liable to suit out of implications gathered from a statute or any group of statutes, but the right to sue the State had to be expressly granted by statute.

The court held that women were as capable of performing the physical acts prohibited by &sect; 97-5-23, as were men, and for the same purposes. The court found no sound or rational basis for making &sect; 97-5-23 applicable to &quot;male&quot; persons only. The court held that the legislative intent to confine application of the statute to male persons, not simply to &quot;any&quot; person as in most criminal statutes, manifested an intentional exclusion of females. The court held that it was not entitled to strike out the limiting term &quot;male&quot; without judicially creating a crime, without legislative sanction, under which females could have been convicted and sentenced.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature passed a local and private legislation authorizing the board to levy an ad valorem tax on all county property for the expense of disposing of garbage in the unincorporated areas of the county. The board found that the garbage situation was a menace to the health of the county. The taxpayer, who resided in the county but owned no property in an unincorporated area, argued that the legislation violated Miss. Const. art. IV, &sect; 112, which mandated uniform and equal taxation throughout the state. The chancery court upheld the statute and the court affirmed. The court found that the county's unique sanitary condition was not a common characteristic for every other county in the state, such that a similar tax was required of all other counties. The court held that because the assessments and tax levy were equal and uniform throughout the respective garbage disposal districts, &sect; 112 was not violated. The court also found that the board was presumed, as a matter of law, to have met any notice requirement of the intent to levy the tax, due to its being a quasi-judicial body and the taxpayer's counsel's failure to stipulate otherwise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant taxpayers appealed from a judgment of the Chancery Court of Rankin County (Mississippi), which held that their action against defendants, the members of the Rankin County, Mississippi Board of Supervisors, their corporate sureties, and a leaseholder, was barred by res judicata. The taxpayers had alleged that the Board's lease of sixteenth section land to the leaseholder constituted an unconstitutional donation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board leased certain sixteenth section land to the leaseholder. Sixteenth section lands were held in trust for school purposes. The taxpayers filed suit and alleged that the lease was for such an inadequate consideration as to constitute a donation under Mississippi Constitution, Article 4, &sect; 95 (1890), which prohibited the donation of state lands to private corporations, individuals, or railroad companies. The trial court held that the action was barred by res judicata in light of a prior confirmation decree that was entered in compliance with Mississippi Code Annotated &sect;&sect; 29-3-103 and 29-3-105 (1972) in an action between the leaseholder and a Board member involving the same lease. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in sustaining the plea in bar. Although the statutory procedure for confirmation of sixteenth section lands was followed by the leaseholder, the court reasoned that the statutory procedure did not and could not override the mandates of the constitution. The leaseholder was not an innocent purchaser because he knew that the land was held in trust. The court concluded that the doctrine of res judicata had to yield to the constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for a hearing on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Authority filed a petition to condemn the landowners' property to construct public parking facilities. The trial court dismissed the petition. The court found that the &sect; 43-35-201 was constitutional, as it was not a local law conferring the right of eminent domain, even though the city was the only municipality with the requisite population. Further, the municipality could establish public parking facilities and exercise the right of eminent domain to acquire property necessary for that purpose and the Authority, acting as an agency of the municipality, had the power to exercise the right of eminent domain. The court affirmed the dismissal of the condemnation proceeding, however, on the sole ground that a quorum of the commissioners of the Authority was not present when the resolutions to condemn the property were adopted. It found that a quorum was not present at the meeting at which the Authority adopted the resolution to exercise the power of eminent domain, as one of the commissioners present was disqualified to vote and could not be counted for purpose of making a quorum.</SPAN></P>

The Chancery Court of Winston County (Mississippi) entered a decree dismissing appellants' bill. Appellants sought review, claiming the chancellor erred in holding that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 37-7-203 (1972) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district covered all of a county and was the only district in that county. Since 1960, the board of trustees of the district had been composed of five members, three of whom were appointed by the city's governing authorities and two of whom were elected by electors of the district outside the city. Section 37-7-203 provided that in any county in which a municipal separate school district embraced the entire county in which two specific highways intersected, one trustee was to be elected from each supervisor's district. The clause relating to the highways applied only to the county. Appellants sued to enforce election of one trustee from each supervisor's district. On appeal, the court held that the chancellor erred in ruling that &sect; 37-7-203, as a whole, violated Miss. Const. &sect; 90(p), which prohibited the legislature from passing a special law providing for the management of any private or common school. Though the clause relating to the highways was unconstitutional in that it bore no rational relationship to the means of electing trustees in the district, the remainder of the act was valid. Accordingly, only the part of &sect; 37-3-203 referring to the highways was to be stricken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the chancellor's decree, rendered judgment for appellants, and remanded the case to the chancellor for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The administratrix filed a wrongful death action against the fellow employees, the employer and the insurer. The trial court held that the Act barred a tort action against the fellow employees and required the employer and the insurer to intervene within 30 days or disclaim any interest in any proceeds recovered. The court affirmed the preclusion of recovery against the fellow employees on the basis that the purpose of the Act was to provide a no-fault system, which would be defeated by the allowance of the action. The court held that the Act was a departure from the common law that was received into the body of law in the state. The court reversed on the overruling of the employer's and the insurer's demurrer because the employer was not subject to suit under Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim operated a grocery store. The living quarters were housed within the store building. Defendant knocked on the victim's door, asked for cigarettes, then shot the victim in the stomach with a shotgun. The victim's wife saw defendant standing in the doorway with a shotgun. Her husband's body was lying on the floor close to defendant. The wife had known defendant for many years. The wife fired a gun at defendant and he fled. The victim was dead so the wife then fled. Defendant returned and stole a gun and the cash box from the store. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to permit defense counsel to withdraw due to conflicting interest. Defense counsel also represented a codefendant at trial. Affirming the conviction, the court noted that the record did not indicate that defense counsel would have approached the defense of the case on another basis had he not been representing the codefendant. The record did not reflect any prejudice or harm resulting to defendant on account of the alleged conflict of interest. The court further found that admission of three black and white photographs of the victim's body were relevant and not inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision from the Circuit Court of Lowndes County, Mississippi, which convicted defendant of capital murder and sentenced him to death. Defendant alleged that the aggravating factors statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101(5)(h) (1972 &amp; Supp. 1975), was unconstitutionally vague and that the death penalty was unconstitutional per se.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot a convenience store owner in the stomach after a robbery as defendant was leaving the store. There was some evidence that the victim was moving towards defendant at the time, but there was other evidence that defendant could have easily fled. Defendant offered as mitigating circumstances the fact that he was 23 years old that he had only a minor criminal record. The jury found as aggravating factors the fact that the murder occurred during a robbery and the cruel nature of the shooting. In its first approval of a death sentence in years, the appellate court affirmed. The court gave substantial deference to the jury's determination. It then held that the phrase &quot;heinous, atrocious, or cruel&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague because an ordinary juror understood its meaning. The second asserted error was rejected based on existing case law upholding the death penalty. Under the statute setting forth the standard of review in death penalty cases, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-105 (Supp. 1977), the court could find no error. The jury properly considered the aggravating and mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

The evidence conflicted as to who actually fired the shots that murdered the attendant. The supreme court affirmed defendant's capital murder conviction and death sentence. The court held that the indictment was sufficient to give defendant fair notice of the crime charged in clear and intelligible language. The trial court did not err in refusing to have defendant committed for psychiatric examination prior to trial, as the only evidence was defendant's testimony that he had headaches, he cooperated with his attorney, and he did not think he was crazy. The trial court properly denied the motion to suppress defendant's statement, which was given voluntarily and with full knowledge of his rights. The court could not say the jury was incorrect in its conclusion as to the death sentence, even considering the mitigating factor of defendant's young age. Imposition of the death penalty was not wanton or arbitrary under the circumstances, based on a survey of prior cases. The punishment was not disproportionate to the crime committed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Sunflower County (Mississippi), which denied his petition for a writ of certiorari directed to respondent Director of Records at the Mississippi State Penitentiary, to obtain statutory good time under Mississippi Code 1972 Annotated &sect; 47-5-139 (Supp. 1973), in effect at the time he was sentenced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that good time credits should have been calculated under Mississippi Code 1972 Annotated Section 47-5-139 (Supp. 1975), in effect at the time he was admitted to the penitentiary. The inmate entered a guilty plea to burglary; his sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation. His probation was revoked, and he was committed to the penitentiary without serving any prior time on the burglary charge. The court rejected the contention that application of the 1975 Supplement was an ex post facto application of the law. Until an inmate was confined, he was not entitled to credits, which related only to his period of confinement. Such credits did not reduce a sentence, but only enabled the inmate to serve the latter part of his sentence outside prison walls. Where all prisoners in the Mississippi State Penitentiary were treated equally, there was no violation of rights to equal protection of the law. Finally, the court found that the inmate was credited with more good time under the 1975 Supplement than he would have under the 1973 Supplement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superintendent objected to the leasing of certain land and alleged that the board improperly and arbitrarily ignored his protests and declined his requests for a hearing. The circuit court dismissed the superintendent's attempted appeals of the board's inaction, without prejudice. On appeal of the dismissal, the court agreed that the board acted improperly and arbitrarily in ignoring the superintendent's protests and in declining to provide a hearing. However, the court noted that the leases had been executed and the lessees were not parties to the proceedings; thus, the dismissal without prejudice was affirmed. Consequently, the superintendent's remedy was by direct attack in appropriate proceedings in a chancery court. The court noted that the facts charged by the superintendent were sufficient to constitute a direct attack upon the granting of the leases based on the alleged gross inadequacy of consideration. The superintendent argued that the leases amounted to an unconstitutional donation of public property, which was in violation of the trust under which the property was held.</SPAN></P>

The court, however, reversed defendant's conviction, holding that the trial court erred by refusing to permit defendant to argue his case to the jury and by permitting the State to show that defendant was on parole during the guilt phase of the trial. The court further held that it was error to allow the testimony of a police officer regarding defendant's contact under a bridge with the victim and another child. The court also reversed and remanded defendant's death sentence, holding that the trial court improperly limited the argument of defendant's counsel to 12 minutes and limited the content of the argument of defendant's counsel. Finally, the court held that the trial court committed reversible error by defining reasonable doubt in an oral instruction to the jury before it was questioned for cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The initial indictment charged defendant with murder, but failed to cite the applicable statute defining the offense as required by Miss.

Therefore, the trial court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment. On appeal, defendant argued that the indictment should have been quashed because it failed to cite and define the offense charged. Defendant also argued that the indictment should have been quashed because he was only 17 when the offense was committed and was subject to the jurisdiction of the youth court. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that the amended indictment satisfied &sect; 99-17-20 (1972) by correctly citing the statute defining capital murder when homicide occurs during the commission or attempted commission of a robbery. In addition, under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-21-31 (1972), the trial court had exclusive jurisdiction over a minor 13 years or older if the minor was charged with a crime punishable by life imprisonment or death.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that: (1) the seller's lien had priority over the creditor's security interest because the lessee voluntarily restored the property to the seller at the creditor's request, and (2) the other lienholder had priority over the creditors because it had no notice of the security interest in the property when it had not been perfected.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that &sect; 3273, regarding assistance to illiterate voters, was effective and constitutional except those portions that differentiated between the assistance available to illiterate voters as opposed to blind or disabled voters. Only illiterate, blind, or disabled voters were allowed to have another person accompany them into a voting booth to assist them in marking their ballots. Assistance was not available until a voter declared his disability, requested assistance, and the managers were satisfied that the disability existed. The poll watchers were illegally permitted to assist voters without regard to whether the voters were entitled to assistance. There were sufficient illegal votes to have changed the election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged a judgment of the Lawrence County Chancery Court (Mississippi), which affirmed an action of respondent's school district's board in not rehiring the employee. The employee had challenged the refusal to rehire under the Public School Fair Dismissal Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37-9-101, et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a school librarian for one of the district's schools. Subsequent to the refusal to rehire her, the employee claimed that the district acted as both a judge and prosecutor in the proceedings before the board, thus denying the employee her due process rights of a fair hearing. On review, the court disagreed and affirmed the judgment. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that a showing that the board was involved in the investigation and adjudication of the case, by itself, did not establish a violation of due process rights. The court held that such a dual role by the board did not overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity of the board's members. Additionally, the court held that the record established that the chancery court had properly made its determination s an appellate tribunal and not on a de novo hearing, though the chancellor permitted witnesses to be introduced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bill set forth that the ordinance was unconstitutional and violated the rights of the owners, the City attempted to prosecute the owners for violations of the ordinance and unless the enforcement of the ordinance was enjoined, irreparable harm and injury would result to the owners. The owners did not charge which part of the ordinance was being violated or facts that constituted irreparable harm and injury. Reversing the overruling of the demurrer, the court stated that the bill did not sufficiently charge material facts upon which injunctive relief could have been granted. The court rejected the claim that the ordinance was unconstitutional on the ground that similar ordinances had been upheld as a valid exercise of the police power. The ordinance was enacted pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 21-19-9 (1972), which authorized municipalities to regulate the running at large of animals of all kinds. The ordinance met the constitutional requirements and the demurrer should have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A paternity suit was filed in the county court concerning four illegitimate children. Based on the jury's verdict, the county court ordered the father to pay child support. However, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 93-9-29(2) (1972), it was only required until the children reached the age of 16 years because they were illegitimate. The children's guardian ad litem appealed the portion of the order restricting the children's right to child support from their father until each reached the age of 16 years. The court reversed in part and modified the order so as to eliminate the age restrictive clause. The court held that there was no rational basis to limit the right of illegitimate children to receive child support. The court held that the state could not invidiously discriminate against illegitimate children by denying them benefits accorded to children generally. The court held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 93-9-7 provided that the father of a child born out of lawful matrimony was liable to the same extent as the father of a child born of lawful matrimony. For a state to deny the right of paternal support to a child because its father did not marry its mother was illogical and unjust.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 27-39-304 (Supp. 1976).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board levied an additional two mill ad valorem tax for general county purposes, and the taxpayer appealed to the circuit court, contending that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-39-304 (Supp. 1976), authorizing such levy, was unconstitutional. The circuit court dismissed the appeal, and the taxpayer sought review. The court held that the designation in &sect; 27-39-304 of Jones County by referring to highways and the 1960 census did not bear a rational relationship to the purpose of &sect; 27-39-304 and thus that portion of the statute violated Miss. Const. of 1890 &sect; 112, but that part of &sect; 27-39-304 that authorized counties to levy additional taxes for general county purposes and the part in the last paragraph that proscribed the procedure to be followed in making the levy were constitutional. The court found that the invalid part of the statute was separable from the valid part and, when such was stricken out, left a complete and consistent plan whereby counties could levy additional taxes for general county purposes. The court concluded the supervisors followed the procedure required for levying the additional one mill tax, and thus, one mill of the additional two mills was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee made loans to state residents secured by real property mortgages within the state, but paid no income tax on interest earned from its lending activities. Appellant assessed taxes under Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 27-7-23(1)(a) and 27-7-49. Appellee challenged the taxes, and the trial court determined that there was not a sufficient nexus to link evidence of ownership of intangible property (the promissory notes) with the state, and overruled the assessment. In reversing and reinstating the assessment, the court concluded that the lower court had construed the statutes in a manner that defeated their legislative purpose. The court concluded that the legislature intended the term &quot;evidence of ownership&quot; to refer to the instrument actually describing the intangible's security and noted that when recorded, the evidence had an actual situs in the county of the secured property.</SPAN></P>
