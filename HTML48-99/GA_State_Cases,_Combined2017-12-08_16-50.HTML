<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extraordinary motion for new trial.  Before Judge Hendrix.  Fulton Superior Court.  October 15, 1948.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exception here is to a judgment overruling an extraordinary motion for new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence in the form of an affidavit by a person who was the principal witness for the State upon the trial, and who by his affidavit, not only asserts that his former testimony was false, but further asserts that he was induced and coerced by the two prosecuting attorneys representing the State into giving the testimony which the attorneys knew at the time was perjured.  One ground of the motion is an attack upon the constitutionality of Code &sect; 110-706, alleging that it offends the due-process and equal-protection clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions, in that it requires conviction of perjury as a condition precedent to the grant of a new trial upon the ground that his conviction was procured by perjured testimony as shown in his motion.  The State made a counter-showing, and by affidavits of the two prosecuting attorneys contradicted the evidence of the movant and denied that either of them had any knowledge of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the falsity of the witness's testimony, and denied that they persuaded or coerced the witness to testify, and that so far as they knew the testimony was freely and voluntarily given.  To the judgment overruling the motion exception was taken, and the writ of error was transmitted to the Court of Appeals, which court held that despite the existence of the constitutional attack upon a State law as shown by the record, since a decision in the case did not require a ruling upon the constitutional question the court had jurisdiction of the writ of error and rendered judgment affirming the judgment of the trial court.  The movant petitioned the Supreme Court for the writ of certiorari, which petition was granted, and thereupon the Supreme Court issued the following order for the purposes therein stated, and in pursuance of such order the Court of Appeals transmitted the original record to this court: &quot;This court having granted the petition for certiorari in the above-stated case on the ground that this court and not the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction of the case, it is hereby ordered that the Court of Appeals transmit the original record and the original bill of exceptions to this court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  forthwith.  It is further ordered that the clerk of this court docket both the case made by the petition for certiorari and the original case and place them on the calendar for argument at the June call in order to avoid delay in the final disposition of the case, should this court, upon consideration of the case made by the petition for certiorari, decide that this court and not the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction of the original writ of error.  It is further ordered that the clerk of this court send a copy of this order to counsel for both sides, and that they be permitted to argue both cases at the June call.&quot; This case was argued as provided in the above-quoted order, together with the case made by the writ of certiorari, and this court on July 11, 1949, rendered judgment in the certiorari case, holding that the Supreme Court, and not the Court of Appeals, had jurisdiction, and for that reason reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's motion for a new trial was based upon allegedly newly discovered evidence that a witness for the State had perjured himself on the stand and that two prosecuting attorneys representing the State coerced the perjury. The prosecuting attorneys denied that they knew that the witness had testified falsely or that they had encouraged any false testimony. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 110-706 that required a conviction of perjury in order to permit a new trial on the basis of perjured testimony. The court held that &sect; 110-706 was constitutional. The statute relieved the trial court of the burden of choosing between contradictory statements and required reliable evidence in the form of a conviction for perjury to justify a new trial. Since defendant's motion for a new trial was not supported by any evidence required by law, the court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Keeping lewd house.  Before Judge Byars.  Upson Superior Court.  December 13, 1948.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An indictment was returned against L. G. Pippin, in Upson Superior Court, charging him in three separate counts with misdemeanors, the material allegations of the first count being that the said accused did then and there unlawfully and with force and arms maintain and keep a lewd house and place for the purpose of fornication and adultery contrary to the laws of the State of Georgia, good order, peace and dignity thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second count of the indictment charged the defendant with a misdemeanor, for that the said L. G. Pippin did then and there unlawfully and with force and arms permit one Fay Doan Parker to remain in the place of said defendant, and premises of said place and being known as Live Oak Filling Station for the purpose of prostitution and assignation; contrary to the laws of said State, the good order, peace and dignity thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third count of the indictment charged the defendant with a misdemeanor, for that the said L. G. Pippin did then and there unlawfully and with force and arms permit one Carolyn Cadwell to remain in said place known as Live Oak Filling Station, and premises&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of same, for the purpose of prostitution and assignation; contrary to the laws of said State, the good order, peace and dignity thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this indictment the defendant demurred and also moved to quash the same upon the grounds:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) That counts two and three were unconstitutional, in that said counts refer to a crime as defined in the Code (Ann. Supp.), &sect;&sect; 26-6203 to 26-6207 inclusive, which said sections are codified from the acts of the legislature of 1943 (Ga. L. 1943, pp. 568 to 571 inclusive), in that said Code sections and said law contravene and are repugnant to article I, section I, paragraph V of the Constitution of Georgia, for that said act deprives this defendant of a &quot;public and speedy trial by an impartial jury,&quot; since &sect; 26-6206 permits the reputation and character of the defendant to be put in issue upon the trial of said case and declares that said character and reputation shall be admissible in evidence in support of any charge thereunder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) That counts two and three of said indictment are unconstitutional, in that they violate, contravene, and are repugnant to article III, section VII, paragraph XVI of the Constitution of Georgia, which provides that &quot;No law, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or section of the Code, shall be amended or repealed by mere reference to its title, or to the number of the section of the Code, but the amending, or repealing act, shall distinctly describe the law to be amended or repealed, as well as the alteration to be made,&quot; in that the act of 1943 and the Code sections taken therefrom repeal &sect; 38-202 of the Code of Georgia, which provides that the general character of the parties, and especially their conduct in other transactions, are irrelevant matter, unless the nature of the action involves such character and renders necessary or proper the investigation of such conduct, since, under the provisions of said act and Code (Ann. Supp.), &sect; 26-6206, it is provided that, &quot;in the trial of any person, charged with a violation of any of the provisions of this law (&sect;&sect; 26-6203 to 26-6207), testimony concerning the reputation or character . . of the defendant or defendants shall be admissible in evidence in support of a charge thereunder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) Because the indictment is fatally defective and void, in that the defendant is charged with maintaining and keeping a lewd house, under &sect; 26-6102 of the Code, in count one, and is charged in counts two and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  three with committing the crime of prostitution and assignation under the Code (Ann. Supp.), &sect; 26-6203, and these offenses are entirely separate, dissimilar, and distinct, and cannot be joined in one indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) Because the indictment charges the defendant with an offense amounting to a misdemeanor under Code &sect; 26-6102, and also with a felony of a dissimilar nature entirely separate and distinct, as defined in Code &sect; 26-6203.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grounds five and six of the demurrers are based upon the grounds that each of counts two and three of the indictment embraces two separate and distinct offenses of equal degree and involves and constitutes separate and distinct transactions, as defined by Code &sect; 26-6205, and that said counts are void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ground seven is stricken as referring to a count four, which does not appear in the indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ground eight demurs to counts two and three for the reason that they are void, in that said counts were drawn under Code &sect; 26-6203, and said section of the Code fixes and defines different grades of punishment for first and second offenses committed thereunder, and said counts are indefinite, void, and uncertain, in that they fail to put the defendant on notice&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as to whether he is charged with a first offense or a second offense, and he cannot properly prepare his defense on account of the ambiguity of the allegations in these counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In grounds nine and ten the defendant demurs to each of counts two and three, upon the ground that each fails to allege, set up, and charge a crime under Code &sect; 26-6203, or any other section, pertaining to prostitution or assignation as defined in the acts of 1943, or Code &sect;&sect; 26-6203 through 26-6207.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other ground of the demurrer, designated and described in one of the demurrers appearing in the record as ground twelve, and in the other as ground ten, is abandoned by counsel in his brief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These grounds were overruled by the trial court, exceptions pendente lite were duly presented and certified, and error is assigned thereon in the bill of exceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the ruling on demurrer, counsel for the defendant presented to the court his written motion as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now comes the defendant and moves this Honorable Court to require the solicitor-general to elect upon which one of the three counts this defendant is to be tried, inasmuch as said indictment charges a distinct and separate offense in count 1 to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that charged in counts 2 and 3, and furthermore defendant prays and demands an election between count 1 and counts 2 and 3, inasmuch as count 1 charges a dissimilar, distinct and separate offense from that which is charged in counts 2 and 3.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the judgment overruling this motion the defendant also excepted pendente lite, and error is assigned thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the trial the jury returned a general verdict of guilty against the defendant, who duly filed his motion for a new trial, twice amended by the addition of ten special grounds, which will be referred to in the opinion; and to the judgment overruling his motion for a new trial the defendant also excepts.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant raised 10 claims of error on appeal. Defendant argued that the statute, on which his prosecution was based, was unconstitutional. The court did not address the constitutional issue because there were other grounds on which the court could decide the case. The court also noted that the indictment was proper because the crimes charged were all of the same class or species and the charges were all misdemeanors. The court also pointed out that the language of the indictment was sufficiently plain for the jury to understand. The court also rejected defendant's arguments that the trial court erred in its rulings concerning the admission of testimony and its instructions to the jury concerning circumstantial evidence and failure to instruct as to a confession of an accomplice witness. The court noted that the accomplice witness had testified. Also, the court found that the jury instructions did not authorize a conviction on charges other than those contained in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petition for injunction.  Before Judge Guess.  DeKalb Superior Court.  January 27, 1949.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 6, 1948, Harold B. Kirkpatrick, Mrs. R. L. Stephens, and Ray Durden, as property owners and taxpayers, filed in DeKalb Superior Court, against G. Scott Candler as Commissioner of Roads and Revenues of DeKalb County, Fred B. Wilson, The Oglethorpe Company, and DeKalb County, a petition, which as twice amended alleged substantially the following: Petitioners are the owners of approximately 200 acres of land fronting on the westerly side of Ashford Park-Dunwoody Road in DeKalb County; and within the past 8 years have constructed at considerable expense their several dwellings and have established their homes.  For several years described realty, consisting of approximately 500 acres, together with petitioners' property, has been and is zoned only for residences and farming; and all other uses, including any kind of apartment houses or apartment business, are prohibited.  Said lands had already been zoned for residence and farming only by an order passed by the Commissioner of Roads and Revenues on June 25, 1946, and by authority of the act approved&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  March 9, 1943 (Ga. L. 1943, p. 930), under the provision of the act designated as the &quot;Comprehensive Plan.&quot; Petitioners' property and the lands in question have never been used for any kind of business and have never been used for purposes other than for family residences, homes, and farming; and by such use for many years all of said lands have become districted and zoned for residences and farming to the exclusion of use for all kinds of business and apartment houses.  Petitioners' property is directly across the Ashford Park-Dunwoody Road from the lands in question, and the construction of apartment houses will reduce the market value thereof at least 25 percent, and will also reduce the desirability of petitioners' properties as private residences.  Such construction will create both a public and private nuisance, working special hurt, inconvenience, and damage to petitioners, because the permit complained of authorizes the erection of 500 units of apartment houses with about 2500 rooms and for 500 families.  There are no sewer facilities to serve said families, comprising approximately 1500 persons, and there is no provision for collecting garbage in the community.  There are&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  no school accommodations for children therein, the schools of the community being now filled to capacity, and the above conditions will render the proposed housing unsanitary, unhealthful, and without educational facilities, all contrary to the public good, and especially hurtful to petitioners since the damage to them will be irreparable and will render them without any adequate remedy at law.  On December 29, 1947, according to the records of the Planning Commission of DeKalb County, The Oglethorpe Company filed an application to have the property in question rezoned from use as residence and farming to that of commercial and for use as apartment houses.  The Oglethorpe Company did not exist at said time, but was chartered under the laws of this State at the time of the filing of the present suit.  The application to have the property rezoned was filed under the act approved on March 9, 1943, supra, and was set for hearing before the Planning Commission appointed thereunder by the Commissioner of Roads and Revenues.  The Oglethorpe Company was not the owner of any of the property in question at the time the application to rezone was filed.  The application was, under the provisions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the act approved March 24, 1939 (Ga. L. 1939, p. 406), invalid, as it did not contain nor was it accompanied by a written petition signed by the owners of 51 percent of the real property within the area covered by the application.  The act of March 9, 1943, did not attempt to repeal the former act of March 24, 1939, providing for a petition to be signed by 51 percent of the property owners.  Section 21 of the act of 1943, providing that the Planning Commission is to administer the act of 1939, was not complied with in the particular stated above by any applicants to zone, nor was it administered by the Planning Commission.  Thereafter, the Commissioner of Roads and Revenues (acting also in behalf of DeKalb County), did, on March 26, 1948, upon the void application of The Oglethorpe Company, and the void recommendation of the Planning Commission, issue an order and rezone the land in question as &quot;an apartment district,&quot; and did thereby amend and change the zoning thereof contrary to the act of 1939.  The Planning Commission and the Commissioner of Roads and Revenues by their acts recognized that the lands were zoned for residence and farming use only, and that the use of same for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any and all kinds of business and for apartment houses was prohibited therefrom, and that use for homes and farms had been established by law and by use.  The defendants, other than DeKalb County, under the void acts on the part of the Planning Commission and of the Commissioner of Roads and Revenues, are preparing to construct upon the lands in question, and are actually constructing apartment buildings thereon.  Sections 8, 9, 10, and 17, of the act of March 9, 1943, are violative of stated provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions, and for reasons stated the rezoning of said land for use as apartment houses was without authority of law and void.  The prayers were: (a) that sections 8, 9, 10, and 17, of the act of 1943, be declared unconstitutional; (b) that the application to rezone and the action taken thereon by the county authorities be decreed to be void as contrary to law; (c) that the defendants be permanently enjoined from erecting apartments or using the lands in question for other than residence or farming; (d) that any construction on the realty in question be enjoined as a nuisance; (e) that process issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demurrers on general and special grounds were interposed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the original petition and renewed to the petition as amended.

The owners contended the disputed sections of the Act of 1943 granting the city the power to rezone property was unconstitutional and that defendants should have been permanently enjoined from allowing the construction of apartments on the land that had been formerly restricted to residential and farming use.. The court on appeal affirmed the judgment of the trial court based on its determination that (1) the disputed sections of the Act were not unconstitutional in granting the town's commissioner the right to amend, modify, or rezone property; (2) the power granted statutorily to the county zoning authority included the county authority's right to rezone property which had already been zoned; (3) the disputed legislation made ample provision for notice, hearing, and appeal, and the granting of powers by the legislature to the commissioner were not unreasonable or arbitrary; and (4) the Act of 1943 did not retain the provision requiring consent of 51 percent of adjacent property owners for proposed zoning changes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injunction.  Before Judge Moore.  Fulton Superior Court.  February 9, 1949.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. G. Aycock and others, alleging themselves to be citizens and taxpayers of the City of Atlanta, filed an equitable petition to enjoin the city and O. M. Harper, building inspector of the city, named as defendants, from further proceedings under an alleged void act and ordinance.  They alleged that the defendants were proceeding under an act of the General Assembly of Georgia, approved March 27, 1947 (Ga. L. 1947, p. 924), which is a local or special act, and is unconstitutional, null, and void, being in violation of the Constitution, art. 3, sec. 7, par. 15 (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-1915).  The defendants further purport to act under an unconstitutional, illegal, and void ordinance of the city, alleged to have been passed pursuant to the powers conferred by the illegal and void act of 1947.  A copy of the ordinance is duly attached to the petition as an exhibit; also attached are certain notices alleged to have been served upon the petitioners by the defendant, O. M. Harper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 1 of the ordinance under attack provides that any building or structure perilous to life or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  property by reason of its construction or condition, the quantity of its contents, the use of the building, deficiencies in its fire-alarm or fire-prevention equipment, conditions of its construction likely to cause the spreading of fire, or impede the combating of fire, etc., are &quot;conditions constituting nuisance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 3 of the ordinance provides that all buildings or structures found to have defects set forth in section 3 shall be deemed a nuisance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 4 provides that, whenever the building inspector has information that any building is alleged to be a nuisance, he shall cause an examination to be made and if, in his opinion, after the examination, the building constitutes a nuisance, the inspector shall serve notice upon the owner or the person in possession, &quot;directing him to abate the nuisance.&quot; Upon failure of the person to obey the notice, the building inspector shall cause a summons to be issued to such person requiring him to show cause at a time and place named therein why the nuisance should not be abated, and, if the alleged nuisance cannot be abated, &quot;why the said building should not be demolished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately following is this provision: &quot;If, upon a hearing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the case, the Recorder determines that such building cannot be repaired or put in a safe condition, he shall render a judgment that the building be demolished by the defendant within a specified number of days and that, upon failure of defendant to demolish it, then the same shall be done by the City of Atlanta at the expense of the defendant.  In the event that the Recorder upon such hearing shall find that the building constitutes a nuisance, but that the nuisance can be abated by the doing of certain things to said building, such as repairs, changes or alterations, the Recorder shall provide in his judgment how and in what manner such nuisance may be abated and shall designate the time within which such acts must be begun.  In such case, the judgment shall further provide that if the defendant fails to begin compliance with said judgment within the time specified, notices shall be placed at the entrances of the building, stating that the premises therein have been declared to be a nuisance and unsafe, and that the entrances to said premises upon the sidewalk or street or alley shall be blocked off by barriers or guardrails.  In the event of an appeal being taken from the judgment, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pending such appeal the Building Inspector shall cause to be erected on the street or sidewalk or alley adjacent to the entrances of the building signs stating that such building has been declared to be dangerous and unsafe.  In the event that upon a hearing as described above the Recorder shall find that the building in such case constitutes a nuisance and orders the same abated within a reasonable time, all such persons properly made party defendant shall be required to correct and remedy the described violation or defect and abate the nuisance within the time provided in the Recorder's judgment and each ten days the prohibited conditions are maintained subsequent to the expiration of the time fixed in said judgment shall constitute an offense under this ordinance and such persons, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding Five Hundred ($ 500.00) Dollars or shall be sentenced to work upon the public works not to exceed sixty days, either or both penalties to be imposed in the discretion of the Recorder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notices served on the petitioner, C. G. Aycock, contain the following language: &quot;Dear Owner: The City of Atlanta has inspected the property at the above address&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and finds the building structurally unsafe, unsanitary, and a fire hazard.  This is to notify you that I have condemned the same as a nuisance and order the building vacated and demolished or made to comply with Slum Clearance Requirements, a copy of which is enclosed, within 90 days from date of this notice.&quot; The building inspector served a like notice on another of the petitioners, Mrs. Blanche O. Chapman.  All notices state &quot;that an examination of the premises described reveals that the same constitutes a nuisance,&quot; and most of them list repairs required to be made.  All notices (approximately 25) conclude with the following language: &quot;You are hereby notified to abate said nuisance and place said premises in a safe condition on or before [a specified date].  Upon your failure or refusal to comply with this notice, the City of Atlanta will institute proceedings against you in the Recorder's Court of the City of Atlanta, as provided by law and the ordinances of said city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants demurred on the general grounds: that (a) the petition sets forth no cause of action; (b) the petitioners have an adequate remedy at law; (c) there is no equity in the petition; and on the special&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grounds, that (a) there is a misjoinder of parties plaintiff; (b) a misjoinder of causes of action; (c) the petition is multifarious.  The demurrers were overruled, and the exception is to that judgment.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Declaratory judgment.  Before Judge Pomeroy.  Fulton Superior Court.  October 29, 1948.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J. E. Murphy filed his petition for a declaratory judgment, which, as amended, alleged in substance: Under an act of the legislature a pension plan was established for the employees of the City of Atlanta, and a board of trustees created, named persons constituting such board.  The City of Atlanta, its comptroller, the board of trustees of the pension fund, and the individual members, are defendants in the case.  On March 27, 1931, the plaintiff was employed by the City of Atlanta.  He has continued in the employment of the city, and contends that he is now an employee of the city, in that he has never been removed for cause, or had any charges preferred against him, or been suspended as provided by law.  His salary was a stated amount.  The nature of his employment was keeping up the building, including plumbing, steam heat, refrigeration and electricity.  He became seventy years of age in 1947.  He was working under the supervision of L. Glenn Dewberry, Superintendent of the City Hall of Atlanta, and on December 29, 1947, he received a letter from Dewberry&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stating that he could no longer work after December 31, 1947, because he had reached seventy years of age.  This letter was issued under and by virtue of a provision in the act approved March 26, 1947, and known as House Bill No. 329.  This act of the legislature is a local act applying to the City of Atlanta alone (and paragraph 6 of the act is set out).  Under such act, and section 6 thereof, if he is required to retire as of December 31, 1947, he is entitled to a pension when so retiring, whether he has served 25 years or not.  During the time of his employment he has made no contribution to the pension fund of the city.  On January 1, 1948, he reported for duty, ready, willing, and able to work.  Since that date the city has not paid him his salary, neither has it paid him a pension.  The city contends that he is no longer employed by it, and not entitled to his salary; and not having made any contribution to the pension fund, that he is not entitled to receive a pension.  All employees of the city are under civil service, and not subject to removal except for cause as provided by law.  He is entitled to his salary, in that he is and has been ready, willing, and able to work, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has reported for work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition further alleged: The act of the General Assembly of 1947, p. 1635, is unconstitutional, null, and void, in that it violates the Constitution, art. 3, sec. 7, par. 15 (which is quoted), in that no notice of intention to apply for the act was published in the manner required, no certificate by the publisher is attached to the enrolled bill, and no affidavit by the author of the bill to the effect that notice had been published is attached and made a part of the bill as enrolled.  The act of the legislature requiring retirement of employees at the age of seventy years is null and void, in that it is class legislation, whereby it includes all employees who have attained the age of seventy years and does not affect those employees who have not attained the age of seventy years, and is not uniform in its operation, in violation of the Constitution, art. 1, sec. 1, par. 2, which provides: &quot;Protection to person and property is the paramount duty of government, and shall be impartial and complete&quot;; and is in further violation of art. 1, sec. 5, par. 2, which provides: &quot;The enumeration of rights herein contained as a part of this Constitution shall not be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  construed to deny to the people any inherent rights which they may have hitherto enjoyed.&quot; Section 6 of the 1947 act denies to him the right to work and earn a living, and it is not impartial, in that it allows persons who have not reached the age of seventy years the right to work for the city, and denies such right to those who have reached the age of seventy years.  He contends: (1) that he is entitled to his salary for the months of January and February, 1948, because he has never been legally discharged, and the act forcing him to retire at the age of seventy years is unconstitutional for the reasons stated; (2) if such act of the legislature is valid, then under section 6 of the act he is entitled to a pension equaling 17/25 of the amount of the salary he was drawing as of January 1, 1948; and (3) if he is entitled to the pension, it should be paid by the city or from the pension fund.  The City of Atlanta and the board of trustees of the pension fund have denied him the right to either of the reliefs claimed by him, and there is an actual controversy between him and the city.  All of the defendants named are interested in the case and the subject-matter thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were: (a) that the 1947 act be declared unconstitutional, null, and void, and the plaintiff declared entitled to his salary; (b) in the event the act is constitutional, then it be declared that, by reason of section 6 of the act, the plaintiff is entitled to his pension in the amount of 17/25 of his salary as of January 1, 1948; (c) if he is entitled to a pension, then it be declared whether it shall be paid by the board of trustees of the pension fund from such fund, or be paid directly by the city; (d) upon the declaration of his rights, that he have judgment ordering the sums to be paid to him; and (e) for other and further relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general demurrers of the defendants, as renewed after the amendment, were sustained, and the exception here is to the sustaining of the demurrers.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee worked for the city, and when he turned 70 years old he was fired under a provision of an act. During the time of his employment, the employee made no contributions to the city's pension fund. The employee instituted a declaratory judgment action, and the trial court sustained the general demurrers filed by defendants in error. The court affirmed. The employee contended that the amendatory act under which he was fired was a local or special law and that it was enacted in violation of Ga. Const. art. 3, &sect; 7, para. 15., O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-1915, providing for the advertisement of all local or special acts. The court held that neither the original act or the amendatory act was prima facie a local or special act. The court held that the legislature made a classification for the purpose of legislation and enacted what was purported to be a general law applicable to all cities falling within the classification. The court held also that the provisions of a section in the original act and a section in the amendatory act were entirely in harmony; by electing not to contribute to the pension fund, the employee was ineligible for a pension.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack G. Tarpley and 55 other persons, as plaintiffs, alleging themselves to be residents, taxpayers, and voters residing in the City of Blairsville, brought their petition against Ben F. Carr, A. R. Rogers, E. S. Dockery, Tom Candler Jr., R. C. Christopher, and Robert E. Colwell, who, it is alleged in the petition, &quot;constitute the Mayor and Council and governing body of the said City of Blairsville,&quot; and against A. J. (Jake) Plott and A. R. Sweat, who are alleged to be citizens of Blairsville, as defendants; and in the original petition it is alleged that the defendant &quot;Mayor and Council,&quot; in June, 1948, authorized and directed the issuance of a license to permit the other defendants to engage in the business of a retail beer store, granting to those defendants permission to buy beer for resale and to sell the same at retail within the city limits of Blairsville.  It is further alleged that the defendants, Plott and Sweat, have not obtained a license from the licensing authorities of Union County.  It is further alleged that some time during the year 1937 an election was held within the City&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Blairsville to determine whether the sale of beer should be permitted within the corporate limits of the City of Blairsville, at which election the majority of the voters participated in the election, voting against beer; and that the question has not since been submitted to the voters; that the mayor and councilmen are without legal right to authorize the sale of beer in the city without the applicants first having obtained a license from the authorities of Union County, and without first submitting the question to the qualified voters of the City of Blairsville; that the plaintiffs have petitioned the mayor and council to deny the application for license and to call an election for the purpose of determining the question; but that the defendants have denied the petition, and persist in their plan and purpose to issue the license.  The plaintiffs allege that they are without remedy at law, and apply to a court of equity to enjoin the issuance of a license by the city and to restrain the other defendants from engaging in the business of the sale of beer, and the original petition prayed: (1) that a rule nisi issue, calling upon the defendants to show cause why they should not be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  permanently enjoined from issuing a license for the sale of beer and from engaging in that business in the City of Blairsville; (2) that at said hearing the defendants and each of them, or any one acting for them, be permanently enjoined from issuing the license or engaging in the business of the sale of beer until the same shall be authorized by an election held in said city for that purpose; (3) that the defendants be temporarily enjoined from issuing such license and from engaging in the business of selling beer until a hearing can be had; and (4) for such other relief as they may be entitled to receive in the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the filing of the petition the trial court, on June 11, 1948, issued a rule nisi setting the matter for a hearing on June 19, 1948, and temporarily restraining the defendants; but on June 14, 1948, this restraining order was revoked and set aside until further order of the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this petition the defendants filed their answer, in which they admitted that a permit had been granted to the defendants, Plott and Sweat, to retail beer in the City of Blairsville, and alleged that the permit had been granted according to law, and they either denied or alleged&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that for want of sufficient information they could neither admit nor deny all other allegations of the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants also interposed a demurrer to the petition as originally filed, but this demurrer does not appear to have been insisted upon, and no ruling thereon by the trial court appears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the date set for the interlocutory hearing, the plaintiffs offered an amendment to the petition, alleging that the ordinance authorizing the sale of beer in the City of Blairsville was null and void, for the reason that the defendants named as mayor and councilmen were not the lawfully elected or appointed mayor and council, because they were acting under and by virtue of a city charter known and identified as &quot;Blairsville City Charter,&quot; appearing in Georgia Laws 1946, pages 340 to 406 inclusive; that said act was violative of paragraph 15, section 7, article 3 of the Constitution of Georgia, in that the enrolled act did not have attached thereto or made a part thereof proper notice of intention to pass the same as required by the constitutional provision referred to, and was therefore null and void; and that any dealings by the mayor and councilmen elected and acting under and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by virtue of the authority of said act were null and void; and prayed that the amendment be allowed, that the defendants be enjoined and restrained as prayed in the original petition, and that an order issue requiring the defendants to appear and show cause why a permanent injunction should not be granted as prayed.  The court allowed the amendment subject to demurrer and set a hearing thereon for July 3, 1948.  The record is silent as to what occurred on July 3, but on September 1, 1948, the plaintiffs filed a second amendment to their original petition, alleging that the defendants named as Mayor and Councilmen of the City of Blairsville were attempting to exercise power and authority as such by passing ordinances under the unconstitutional charter, and were collecting money and were seeking to collect money from taxes and licenses from the plaintiffs and other citizens and taxpayers, without warrant and authority, and are obligating and seeking to obligate the City of Blairsville for the payment of sums of money contrary to law; and praying that the said charter be adjudged and declared unconstitutional, null and void, and that the defendant mayor and councilmen be enjoined and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  restrained from collecting and receiving taxes and other money belonging to the city, from disbursing any money belonging to the city, and from passing and enforcing any ordinances, and generally from exercising the business and duties of a mayor and councilmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this amendment the defendants filed an answer denying the allegations thereof, and alleging that they had not forced any one to pay any taxes and had not threatened to force any one to pay any taxes, and that they had issued no tax execution, and praying that the petition be dismissed and the prayers thereof denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 11, 1948, the petition as thus amended came on for a hearing, and the plaintiffs introduced evidence, consisting of an affidavit of two of the plaintiffs; a certain notice to another of the plaintiffs dated August 20, 1948, signed by the mayor and requesting payment of 1947 taxes; a certain business license issued by the city on March 29, 1948; and a certified copy of the charter of the City of Blairsville referred to in the petition.  It is recited in the bill of exceptions that the defendants introduced no evidence, and that after argument of counsel the trial judge passed an order enjoining&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the defendants from authorizing or engaging in the sale of beer in the City of Blairsville, but expressly reserved decision on the question of constitutionality of the charter of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 15, 1948, the defendants filed an amendment to their answer, in which they alleged that the mayor and councilmen were elected to fill their respective offices at an election held in May, 1946, in which election most, if not all, of the resident plaintiffs participated; that at another election held in the city for the purpose of electing said officers part of these same officers were re-elected to the same offices they now hold; that the defendants have been recognized as such officers by the people of Blairsville from the time they were first elected until now; that they have exercised the functions of their said offices, have never ceased or refused to act as officers; that the functions of these offices have been performed by the defendants in good faith, and their right so to act has never been questioned by any person who claims the right to hold these offices; and that the plaintiffs, by their petition, were making the first attack on the right of the defendants to hold the offices&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of mayor and councilmen.  It is further alleged in this answer that, if the courts should hold that the present charter of the City of Blairsville is void and that these officers are not de jure officers, then and in that event the defendants claim that they are officers de facto, and have the right to exercise all of the powers given them as said officers by the act of 1908 (Ga. L. 1908, p. 414), which is of force and effect if the present charter is declared void.  The defendants prayed: for a rule nisi directed to the plaintiffs, requiring them to be and appear at a time and place named by the court to show cause why the prayers of the defendants should not be granted; and (a) that upon the hearing all of the equity and relief permissible under the pleadings of the case be afforded the defendants; (b) that in the event the court holds the present charter invalid, the charter of 1908 be declared by the court to be of full force and effect; (c) that, in the event the court should determine that they are not officers de jure, the court pass an order declaring them to be officers de facto, with the right to act in all particulars and with the same degree of authority with respect to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  their conduct of the offices as if they were officers de jure, with the right to act until their successors are elected and qualified; and (d) that the restraining order previously granted by the court be dissolved or vacated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the filing of this amendment, the court provided for service of a copy thereof on the plaintiffs or their counsel, and set the matter for a hearing on September 17, 1948.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is recited in the bill of exceptions that on this hearing no additional evidence was introduced, and that after argument of counsel the court entered its order and judgment as follows: &quot;The above-stated case coming on before me for hearing this date upon an amendment filed by defendants, after hearing argument of counsel, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the charter of the City of Blairsville as described in plaintiffs' petition be, and it is hereby adjudged unconstitutional, null and void, but that the defendants named as Mayor and Council of the City of Blairsville are de facto officers, and as such are empowered to enforce the ordinances of said City of Blairsville; and to discharge all duties of such officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is further ordered that the prayers of plaintiffs for injunction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be, and they are hereby denied, and the restraining order heretofore granted is dissolved and vacated; it is further ordered that said restraining order shall, however, remain in full force and effect until plaintiffs shall have a reasonable time in which to file a bill of exceptions in said case, and upon the filing of said bill of exceptions, this order shall operate as a supersedeas until said case shall have been determined by the Supreme Court of the State of Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Granted at chambers at Blairsville, Georgia, this the 17th day of September, 1948.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To so much of this order as denied the injunction prayed for by the plaintiffs and as adjudged the defendant mayor and councilmen to be de facto officers the plaintiffs excepted.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayers sought review of an order of the Union Superior Court (Georgia), which denied their request for an injunction, adjudged defendants, a mayor and councilmen, to be de facto officers of a city, and dissolved a previous restraining order which restrained defendants from issuing a license to sell beer to defendant citizens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers originally sought to enjoin an issuance of a license to sell beer and later amended their petition to include the issues of whether the city charter was void and whether defendants were, therefore, unlawfully elected. The trial court found that the charter was unconstitutional, and therefore, void but that defendants were de facto officers. The trial court also dissolved the restraining order previously granted in regard to the license to sell beer. The taxpayers appealed, and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the judgment of the trial court holding that the mayor and all five councilmen were de facto officers was erroneous to the extent of two of the councilmen, for the previous charter provided for a mayor and only three councilmen. The court held, however, that the trial court properly held that the mayor and three councilmen were de facto officer because there were de jure offices for them to fill. The court held further that the trial court did not err in failing to enjoin the issuance of the license to sell beer but that it should have enjoined defendants from collecting taxes based upon a rate fixed by the void charter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding under an act approved March 25, 1947 (Ga. L. 1947, p. 601), the City of Atlanta, a municipal corporation, brought an action in rem to condemn several separately described and separately owned parcels of land in Fulton County, Georgia, among which was a tract owned by I. W. Pilgreen.  It was alleged in that petition that the city's Mayor and General Council had by resolution determined that it was necessary to acquire the property sought to be condemned for street purposes and had appropriated $ 1,200,000 for that purpose.  On May 7, 1948, I. W. Pilgreen filed a suit in the Superior Court of Fulton County against the City of Atlanta, and prayed that its pending action for the condemnation of his lands be permanently enjoined.  His petition, after being twice amended, in substance alleged that it was unnecessary for the city to take his property for such purposes, and that the act under which the city was proceeding violated several stated provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions and was for that reason null and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant (City of Atlanta) demurred generally to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  amended petition upon these grounds: (1) it states no cause of action, either at law or in equity; (2) the allegations affirmatively show that the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law; and (3) the allegations affirmatively show that the City of Atlanta in its condemnation proceeding is legally following the provisions of the act of 1947, and that the act is not unconstitutional for any reason assigned.  After reciting that the allegations of the petition for injunction, other than the constitutional questions raised by it, were sufficient to state a cause of action for the relief sought, the court overruled the demurrer upon each and every ground.  To this judgment the plaintiff Pilgreen excepted pendente lite &quot;in so far as the same was or could be construed as a ruling on the constitutional questions, holding that said act of 1947 (Ga. L. 1947, p. 601) was constitutional, and that the petition of the plaintiff in that regard did not set up a cause of action.&quot; And in the main bill of exceptions error is assigned on the same.  The defendant, City of Atlanta, also excepted pendente lite to the judgment overruling its general demurrer to the petition and in a cross-bill of exceptions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  assigned error on the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant's answer admitted that it had filed a proceeding in rem under the act of 1947 to condemn the plaintiff's property, together with other lands, and alleged that it was necessary for the city to acquire the property for street purposes.  The answer denied that the act under which it was proceeding was unconstitutional for any reason assigned.  On the trial, and after both parties had introduced much evidence, the court directed the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, and a final judgment was accordingly entered.  In the decree denying injunctive relief it was also decreed that the act of 1947 under which the plaintiff was proceeding was not unconstitutional for any reason assigned.  The plaintiff Pilgreen excepted to that judgment, and the case comes to this court for review both by direct bill of exceptions and by cross-bill.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city brought a condemnation action against the landowner. The landowner filed a petition for a permanent injunction claiming that the act under which the city was seeking to condemn his property, 1947 Ga. Laws 601, to widen a street was unconstitutional and that it was unnecessary to take his land. The city demurred generally and stated that there was no cause of action, that the allegations affirmatively showed that the landowner had agreed as to the value, and that the act under which the city was acting was not unconstitutional. The trial court directed a verdict for the city, finding that the act was constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that Ga. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3, para. 1 (1945) provided that property could not be taken or damaged for public purposes without just and adequate compensation being first paid and that a hearing was required in order to determine the value of the property and the amount of the compensation. The court concluded that because the act in question allowed for the city and a landowner to come to an agreement on value and then have a court sanction that agreement, the fundamental right to a hearing on the value was destroyed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equitable petition.  Before Judge Mallory C. Atkinson.  Bibb Superior Court.  September 7, 1948.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case originated in the Superior Court of Bibb County, when that county, hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff, filed a petition against Charles H. Garrett, et al., hereinafter referred to as the defendants, seeking a declaratory judgment for the settlement of a justiciable controversy, existing between the plaintiff, on the one side, and the defendants, on the other, over the validity and meaning of a pension and retirement plan, inaugurated by resolution of the governing authorities of the plaintiff, and, by its terms, affecting each and all of the defendants.  The brief of counsel for the plaintiff states the contentions of the respective parties, and the facts of the case, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was contended: (a) By the plaintiff, that such retirement and pension plan was authorized and justified by a constitutional amendment of specific application, proposed by resolution (Ga. L. 1945, p. 106) and ratified at the general election held August 7, 1945; and by the defendants, that such amendment was not properly adopted, in that it was purportedly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ratified contemporaneously with ratification of the Constitution of 1945, and therefore could neither be an amendment to the Constitution of 1877, which was extinguished on August 7, 1945, nor an amendment to the Constitution of 1945, which had no existence prior to that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) By the plaintiff, that the retirement and pension plan was authorized and justified by an enabling act of the General Assembly of specific application (Ga. L. 1946, p. 237), and even though such act delegated powers to the local authorities, such powers were not legislative in character, but were administrative or at most quasi-legislative powers; and that even though the delegated powers were legislative in character such delegation was authorized by the Constitution; and contended by the defendants, that such act of the General Assembly was invalid and unconstitutional, in that it involved an unauthorized delegation of legislative powers reserved exclusively by our Constitution to the General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(c) By the plaintiff, that even though the specific constitutional amendment referred to in contention &quot;A&quot; was invalidly adopted, the legislative enactment referred to in contention &quot;B&quot;, was authorized&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and valid in view of that provision of the Constitution of 1945 authorizing the General Assembly to delegate to counties authority to levy a tax &quot;to provide for workmen's compensation and retirement or pension funds for officers and employees,&quot; (Code &sect; 2-5701, sub-paragraph 15); and by the defendants, that the authority to delegate the power to tax for the purpose did not authorize delegation of legislative powers to make the tax necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(d) By the defendants, that even though the legislative enactment referred to in contention &quot;B&quot; be otherwise valid, it was expressly repealed by another act of the General Assembly (Ga. L. 1947, p. 674), which was neither a local nor special act requiring notice of intention to apply for passage; and by the plaintiff, that the repealing act relied upon by the defendants was itself invalid, since the enrolled act which was a local or special law did not disclose, by reference or attachment, that it had been properly advertised, and because, if otherwise effective, said act would impair obligations of contract, created by the adopttion of the pension and retirement plan prior to the passage of the alleged repealing act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(e) By the plaintiff, that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  even though the specific constitutional amendment described in contention &quot;A&quot; was improperly adopted and ratified, and even though the specific enabling act described in contention &quot;B&quot; was invalid or had been repealed, the pension plan adopted by the plaintiff was authorized by the specific constitutional provision pointed out in contention &quot;C&quot; (purposes for which the right to levy taxes might be delegated), and the general enabling act (Ga. L. 1946, p. 87, Code &sect; 92-3701) delegating to counties the power to levy a tax &quot;to provide for workmen's compensation and retirement or pension funds for officers and employees&quot;; and by the defendants, that the power to levy a tax for providing a pension fund did not carry with it the implied power to enact legislation to create the pension plan, and that such legislation would have to be supplied by the General Assembly and not by the local authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(f) By the plaintiff, that since pension and retirement plans were compensatory and in the nature of salaries and compensation to officers and employees, the plaintiff had the implied power to adopt such a plan and system of compensation; and by the defendants, that counties have no implied powers, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  save those essential or necessary to their existence and operation, and that a pension or retirement plan was not such an implied power of the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(g) By the plaintiff, that the application of the local pension plan, by its terms, to &quot;include all persons, elective or appointive, whether appointed by the board (commissioners) or by an elected or appointed official, whose salary, wage or compensation is paid by the county,&quot; was authorized by the several constitutional provisions and enactments and implied powers, and that the words, &quot;officers and employees,&quot; as used in such provisions and enactments should have a liberal interpretation in accord with the beneficent purposes intended by pension plans and enactments, so as to justify the interpretation placed upon them by the local pension plan; and by the defendants, that the words county &quot;officers and employees,&quot; as used in the several constitutional provisions and legislative enactments, have a well-defined and restricted meaning, which does not authorize the latitude assumed by the local plan, that there is no implied power to adopt a county pension plan, and that the application of such plan to many of the defendants is unjustified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and ultra vires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was submitted to Honorable Mallory C. Atkinson on the pleadings and an agreed statement of facts, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) All of the persons named as defendants and to be affected by a decision in this case, are rendering services in one of the following departments: (a) The office of the Board of County Commissioners, (b) The office of the Solicitor-General, (c) The City Court of Macon, which is a Constitutional City Court, (d) The Municipal Court of Macon, (e) The Juvenile Court, (f) The Bibb County Home and Farm, (g) The Superior Court Clerk's office, (h) The Court of Ordinary, (i) The Sheriff's office, (j) The Tax Commissioner's office, (k) The Treasurer's office, (l) County Policemen, (m) Coroner, (n) County Engineer and Department of Roads and Bridges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(2) All salaries and compensation received by such persons are paid exclusively from funds of Bibb County, with the exception of the Solicitor-General, who receives $ 6000 per annum from Bibb County, and $ 1000 per annum from each of the other three counties in the Macon Judicial Circuit, and who receives certain fees from the State in certain classes of cases.  In the application of the pension plan of Bibb&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  County, only compensation paid by Bibb County is considered or affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(3) With the exception of the compensation received by the Solicitor-General, which is fixed by statute, the salaries of all persons affected by the pension plan are paid by the County Commissioners alone, or, in some instances, such as the Superior Court Clerk's office, the Court of Ordinary, the Sheriff's office, and the Tax Commissioner's office, by the County Commissioners with the consent and approval of the Grand Jury then in session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(4) The Solicitor-General, the Judge of the City Court, the Solicitor of the City Court, the Judge of the Municipal Court, the Clerk of the Superior Courts, the Ordinary, the Sheriff, the Tax Commissioner, the Treasurer, and the Coroner, are elective officers who receive their commissions from the Governor of the State.  The Judge of the Juvenile Court is appointed by the Judges of the Superior Courts.  The heads of all departments are appointed by the County Commissioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(5) Personnel in the office of the Solicitor-General, City Court, Municipal Court, Juvenile Court, Treasurer, Clerk of Superior Court, Ordinary, Sheriff, and Tax Commissioner, except the Tax Attorney, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are selected by the heads of these respective departments.  All other personnel, excepting the Judge of the Juvenile Court, are selected by the County Commissioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(6) Official bonds of the Solicitor, Clerk, and Deputy Clerk of the City Court, Clerk and Sheriff of the Municipal Court, Clerk of the Superior Court, Ordinary, and Sheriff are payable to the Governor of Georgia.  The bonds of the Deputy Clerks and Deputy Sheriffs in the Municipal Court are payable to the Clerk and Sheriff, respectively.  The bonds of the Deputy Clerks in the Superior Court are payable to the Clerk.  The bonds of the several Deputy Sheriffs, Jailer, and Assistant Jailer are payable to the Sheriff.  The bonds of Clerk and Deputy Clerks in the office of the Tax Commissioner are payable to the Tax Commissioner.  The bond of the Coroner is payable to the Ordinary.  The bonds required of all other persons affected by the pension plan are payable to the Board of County Commissioners, except that, in addition, the Tax Commissioner also gives a bond payable to the Governor of the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(7) One of the acts under which Bibb County claims the right and authority to adopt the pension plan in question (Ga. L. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1946, p. 237) has attached to the original bill -- H. B. 756 -- a copy of the advertised intention to apply for the legislation, together with the affidavit of the publisher, and affidavit of the author.  The enrolled bill, No. 546, has attached to and enrolled with it, an affidavit of the author of the bill as to proper advertisement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(8) The act (Ga. L. 1947, p. 674), which the defendants contend resulted in repeal of the act just hereinabove described, has attached to the original bill (H. B. 339) copy of the advertised intention to apply for the legislation together with the affidavit of the parties.  The enrolled bill, No. 339, has no reference in it or attachment to it, referring to any advertisement of the intention to apply for such legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(9) The pension plan of Bibb County was adopted March 17, 1947, and by its terms affected all pay rolls from and including the pay-roll period beginning March 15, 1947.  Deductions thereafter made, therefore, affected salaries and wages earned during the period March 15, 1947, to and including March 20, 1947, on which last date the act described in paragraph (8) above was approved.  The deductions for such intervening period of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  time were made without the consent of the persons affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(10) The act of the General Assembly of 1945 (Ga. L. 1945, p. 106), proposing a constitutional provision to permit the Commissioners of Bibb County to inaugurate a pension plan was duly passed by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the General Assembly and was approved on March 9, 1945.  The proposal was submitted to the people for ratification at the general election of 1945, on August 7, 1945, and was duly ratified by the requisite majority both in the State at large and in the area and jurisdiction affected by it; that is, Bibb County.  The adoption was duly certified by the Secretary of State and was proclaimed by the Governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(11) Each person affected by the pension plan was given the opportunity of withdrawing from the plan and having contributions made by him or her returned.  The defendants did not exercise such option.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel for the defendants, in his brief, states that the contentions of the parties and the facts of the case are correctly set out in the opposing brief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court entered its order and judgment determining that the pension and retirement plan of the plaintiff was invalid.  In doing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  so, the court ruled adversely to all the contentions of the plaintiff, except that it determined that the repealing act relied upon by the defendants (Ga. L. 1947, p. 674) was invalid, and also determined that, if the plan were otherwise valid, it would apply to more of the defendants than contended for by them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To so much of the judgment of the trial court as ruled adversely to the plaintiff it excepted by direct bill of exceptions, and to so much of the judgment as ruled adversely to the contentions of the defendants they excepted by cross-bill of exceptions.  </SPAN></P>

The county filed an action for a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of the plan. The trial court ruled that the plan was invalid. The county claimed on appeal that the plan was properly adopted pursuant to 1946 Ga. Laws 237. The court rejected the county's claim. The court ruled that the law did not attempt to convey power to the county to adopt rules to carry out a law but that it vested full power and authority in the county, at its discretion, to inaugurate, constitute, and administer a pension plan. Because 1946 Ga. Laws 237 was an unwarranted and unconstitutional attempt to delegate the General Assembly's legislative authority, the court ruled that it was invalid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present case comes to this court on exceptions to the findings and judgment of the Superior Court of Bibb County, on a petition for a declaratory judgment filed by the City of Macon against Watson Walker, a former officer and employee of the city, with respect to the right of Walker to a pension under an alleged ordinance enacted by the Mayor and Council.  It was alleged in the petition: that the General Assembly, at its 1947 session, purportedly enacted a law (Ga. L. 1947, p. 1258) which authorized the Mayor and Council of the city to adopt a pension and retirement plan for a certain class of its employees, and which specifically excepted any group of city employees then operating under an existing pension system; that, following the enactment of the alleged act by the General Assembly, the Mayor and Council of the City of Macon then in office passed an alleged ordinance establishing such a pension plan.  It was further alleged: that under the ruling in Smith v. McMichael, 203 Ga. 74 (45 S. E. 2d, 431), the act is unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and void because proof of advertisement as required by the Constitution of 1945 (art. 3, sec. 7, par. 15; Code, Ann. Supp., &sect; 2-1915) was not attached to and made a part of the enrolled act; that without such enabling act the city had no power or authority to enact an ordinance establishing a pension system for its employees; and that the defendant Walker had denied this and demanded that the city pay him the sum of $ 72 per month, which he claims to be due under the provisions of the pension ordinance.  The prayers were for process and a declaration of the rights and responsibilities of the parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By his answer, the defendant denied that the enabling act of the General Assembly is unconstitutional and void for the reason assigned, and contended that the ordinance enacted by the Mayor and Council is valid whether enacted under the authority of the enabling act or pursuant to the charter powers of the city.  He prayed that the court declare him to be entitled to the benefits of the pension ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the ruling of the trial court that the city had the implied power, under its charter provisions, to enact the ordinance in question, the city excepted, and filed a direct bill of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  exceptions; and to the ruling that the enabling act of the General Assembly is unconstitutional and void, the defendant excepted and filed a cross-bill of exceptions.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city filed a declaratory judgment action against the former employee with respect to the rights of the employee to a pension under an ordinance enacted by the mayor pursuant to an enabling act passed by the legislature. The trial court found that the enabling legislation was unconstitutional, but found that the ordinance was valid under the city's implied powers. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court agreed with the trial court's finding that the enabling act was void and unconstitutional because the bill made no reference to advertisement and attached no copy of the advertisement or an affidavit to the enrolled copy of the bill as required. However, the trial court erred in determining that the mayor had sufficient implied charter power to enact the retirement ordinance. The state had, by its express grant of power to the city to retire and pension a limited group of its employees, by implication excluded from it the power to retire and pension those in another group or class.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unemployment Compensation; constitutional.  Before Judge Hendrix.  Fulton Superior Court.  June 8, 1948.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exception in this case is to a judgment overruling the plaintiff's motion for a new trial, after submission of the cause to a judge to determine without the intervention of a jury.  The petition was brought under section 14 (d) of the Georgia Unemployment Compensation Law, by Cartersville Candlewick Inc. against Ben T. Huiet, Commissioner of the Department of Labor, to recover alleged overpayment of contribution made to the Department of Labor under the Unemployment Compensation Law.  Ga. L. 1937, p. 836; Ga. L. 1941, p. 552; Ga. L. 1945, p. 337; Code, Ann. Supp., &sect; 54-650.  The petition was in two counts, which were substantially identical except that count 2 attacked the first paragraph of section 19 (f) of the Unemployment Compensation Law as being violative of stated provisions of the Federal and State Constitutions.  Ga. L. 1937, p. 841; Code, Ann. Supp., &sect; 54-657 (f).  The substantial prayers of the first count were: (2) that the petitioner be declared a successor to the benefit-experience rating of its predecessor, the Cartersville&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Division of Candlewick Yarn Mills; (3) that the petitioner be awarded a judgment for $ 605.02, with interest.  The second count contained in addition to the above a prayer that &quot;section 19 (f) (1) be declared unconstitutional, as violative of sections 1-815, 2-102, 2-103, and 2-5001 of the Annotated Code of Georgia of 1933.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no demurrer to the petition, but the defendant answered, denying that the plaintiff was entitled to the recovery sought, and denying the unconstitutionality of the act attacked.  The judge, trying the case without a jury, found in favor of the defendant as to both counts of the petition, and refused a new trial, and the plaintiff excepted.  The motion for a new trial was based on the general grounds, with amplifications thereof.  Two contentions are argued in the brief of counsel for the plaintiff, to wit: (1) section 19 (f) of the Unemployment Compensation Act is inapplicable to the facts of the instant case; (2) if said section is construed to be thus applicable, it is unconstitutional as being violative of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, and of the equal-protection, due-process, and uniformity-of-taxation provisions of the Constitution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties stipulated as follows: &quot;In the year 1937, Candlewick Yarn Manufactuding Company was incorporated in Bartow County, with stock ownership equally in Messrs.  Slaughter, Hamilton, Knight, and Dawson.  This corporation operated one mill at Cartersville, Georgia.  In the year 1940, the corporation acquired a second mill at Dalton, Georgia.  Separate operating records were set up for this mill.  Separate reports were also made to the Georgia Unemployment Compensation Bureau, and separate contributions made.  In December, 1941, the corporation was dissolved and operation of the mills continued as a partnership.  Under the partnership, separate records on each mill were maintained.  From the dissolution of the corporation until the year 1943, the partnership filed separate unemployment compensation returns for each mill.  For the year 1943, and for each year thereafter, the partnership in response to a request from the Bureau combined the reports of the two mills, and filed them together.  But each mill had a separate and distinct purchasing and selling office, personnel officer, and separate plant.  In December, 1946, the Cartersville division and the Dalton division&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  each incorporated as separate and distinct entities, under the names respectively of Cartersville Candlewick Inc. and Dalton Candlewick Inc., with the four partners subscribing to equal amounts of stock in the two companies.  All assets except life insurance and a cash reserve set aside for pre-determined tax liability of the old partnership were transferred to the respective corporations, and operations continued without interruption.  The value of the property acquired by the Cartersville corporation was approximately $ 120,000.00, while the value of the property acquired by the Dalton corporation was approximately $ 75,000.00.  Since 1940 the employment history of the two plants as one entity was favorable, qualifying it before its division into two entities to the minimum rate in so far as the experience rating formula applied to benefits paid to unemployed workers.  Each of these mills has at all times herein referred to had in its employ more than eight employees, the Cartersville plant approximately ___ workers and the Dalton plant approximately ___ workers.  On or about April 1, 1947, Forms GA-UC 1 were filed with the Department of Labor, setting out therein that Cartersville&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Candlewick Inc. had acquired all the assets of the Cartersville Division of Candlewick Yarn Mills (which name was assumed by the corporation in 1940 when the Dalton Mill was acquired), and that Dalton Candlewick Inc. had acquired all the assets of the Dalton Division of Candlewick Yarn Mills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 1941 the Unemployment Compensation Act was amended, setting up a formula under which the original basic or 'standard' rate of contributions of 2.7 percent computed upon wages paid workers by the employers could be reduced on a scale therein fixed to a minimum of 1.5 percent, the formula being made up of the amount of benefits paid to unemployed workers under the employers and other factors set up in the amendment.  On April 30, 1947, petitioner filed returns for the first quarter of 1947 and paid to defendant $ 756.28 computed on a contribution rate of 1.5% of its wages payable for employment.  The rate of 1.5% used in its return was the experience rate earned by Candlewick Yarn Mills, the preceding partnership.  On or about July 1, 1947, defendant made demand on petitioner for additional contributions for the first quarter of 1947 for the excess up to the standard rate of 2.7% on its wages&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  payable to employment over the amount of 1.5% reduced rate already paid, and petitioner on July 15, 1947, because of defendant's contention that petitioner was not qualified for a reduced rating under said formula, under protest, paid to defendant $ 605.02.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On or about November 21, 1947, a claim for refund was filed with the Department of Labor, Employment Security Agency, on Forms GA-UC 518, provided by said Agency for such purpose.  On or about November 24, 1947, petitioner received notice by letter from the Department of Labor that its claim had been rejected.  The Commissioner refused to recognize petitioner as a successor employer under section 7 (c) 7 (iv) to the benefit-experience rating of Candlewick Yarn Mills, and bases his refusal on section 19 (f) (1) and 19 (g) (1).&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southeastern Textile Company filed a request for review with the Board of Commissioners of the City of Griffin from an assessment made by the tax assessors of the city on the ad valorem property of the company.  The action by the board of commissioners was adverse to the textile company and an appeal was filed by the company to the Superior Court of Spalding County, pursuant to provisions of section 28 of the charter of the city (Ga. L. 1921, p. 959).  The trial resulted in a verdict by the jury reducing the assessed value of the property of the company in the amount of $ 10,000.  A motion for new trial, as amended, of the City of Griffin was overruled, and the exception is to that judgment.  In the bill of exceptions it is stated that the amended motion for new trial involves the construction of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the constitutionality of section 28 of the charter of the City of Griffin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ground five of the amended motion for new trial assigns error on the following extract from the charge of the court: &quot;I charge you, gentlemen of the jury, that this appeal under investigation and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which you are to pass upon is a de novo investigation, which simply means that you are not bound by anything the City Tax Assessors did or the City Commissioners did.  It is a de novo investigation, as far as you are concerned, and it is your duty to pass upon the right or wrong of this transaction without regard to what the Tax Assessors did or the City Commissioners did.  You are not bound by anything they did.  This is a new and distinct trial.  What someone else may have done in connection with this matter should have no bearing on what you do, and in making up your verdict in this case you should not consider anything they did over there as a criterion to place your verdict upon.  You will make up your verdict in this case solely from the evidence as delivered from the witness stand and the law as given you in charge by the court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is contended by the movant that this charge was prejudicial error, because section 28 of the charter of the City of Griffin is in conflict with the Code, &sect; 92-4001; that under the general law the decision of the assessors was final and conclusive, and the provisions of the local act would be unconstitutional as being in violation of the Constitution, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  art. 1, sec. 4, par. 1 (Code, Ann., &sect; 2-401), which provides: &quot;No special law shall be enacted in any case for which provision has been made by an existing general law.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Davis was indicted and tried for the murder of J. W. Carter.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty with a recommendation of mercy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the trial, evidence in behalf of the State tended to show: The accused and the deceased had had considerable trouble over crops growing, and work performed, on a farm owned by the deceased, on which the accused worked as a share cropper.  On the day of the homicide, November 18, 1947, the accused and several of his children were hauling corn in a wagon from a field.  They had hauled one load of corn and placed it in a crib belonging to the deceased, and were leaving the field with another load, when the homicide occurred.  On reaching the field gate, they found the deceased at the gate, nailing the gate shut with a piece of iron.  The accused told the deceased to open the gate, and the deceased failed to do so.  Thereupon, the accused reached into the wagon, got a shotgun, and shot the deceased, the load of shot almost severing the decedent's right arm.  The deceased then ran toward his house.  He had reached the gate to his yard, about thirteen steps from the field gate, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and was attempting to open the gate with his back toward the accused, when the accused shot him again, the load of shot striking the deceased in the back and severing his spinal cord.  After the shooting the deceased's right arm was amputated; and about ten days later he died as a result of the shot in his back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foregoing is, briefly, the case as made by the State.  No witnesses testified for the accused, but he made a lengthy statement to the jury, in which he detailed the various difficulties between him and the deceased over a division of crops and the failure of the deceased to pay him and his family for work performed on the farm.  The defendant then gave the following account of the homicide: &quot;When I went back to gather the corn and finish hauling the corn that I had broke down in the field, well, during the time that we went in at the gate until we come back to the gate Mr. Carter had nailed the gate up.  The threats Mr. Carter had made to me and to others was the reason why I carried my gun along -- was to protect the lives of my children and myself if it was necessary.  When we come back to the gate Mr. Carter had nailed that gate.&quot; The defendant stated that the deceased&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  left his porch with a piece of iron and went to the gate, where the defendant's son was trying to unlatch the gate, and cursed and abused the defendant and his son and threatened to kill his son.  The defendant further stated: &quot;He reached over the fence with his left fist and knocked my boy on the back part of his head and knocked him down and reached out to hit him, and when he did that I run over there on the load of corn and got my gun and loaded it, and as I had loaded my gun my boy was staggering around getting up -- you know, senseless -- and then he reached to hit him, strike him with the piece of iron, and I shot him in his right arm to prevent him from hitting my child with the piece of iron, and I didn't want to kill Mr. Carter.  . . . Then when I had shot the piece of iron out of his hand, he turned around and called to his wife.  He says, 'Hand me my gun yonder at the gate,' and turned around and rushed back to the gate . . . and when he reached his gate he opened the gate back to reach in behind the gatepost to get his shotgun.  When he asked her to bring him a gun, his wife had run in the house and got a rifle; and he picks this gun up by the gatepost and put the stock&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under his left arm, and cocked that gun.  I said to Mr. Carter, 'Throw that gun down,' and he refused, and I reloaded my gun and said to Mr. Carter, 'Throw that gun down,' and as he turned and raised up with that gun in position to shoot me and my children, he saw that I had my gun on him, and just as I shot he turned around that way (illustrating), is how he got shot in his back.  His wife run to him and took his gun and the rifle that she had and carried [them] to the door step to her daughter named Mary, and told her to 'put these guns in the house.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant's statement of how the homicide occurred was materially different from, and rebutted by, testimony offered by the State.  The following testimony given by a daughter of the deceased is illustrative of the evidence produced by the State: &quot;I remember the morning of November 18, 1947, that my father was shot.  I was present then.  It happened out there at the gate by the car house, the gate that enters the field.  Two shots were fired, the first at the gate entering the field when I was standing on the door steps at the front porch in full view where I could see my father and Mr. Davis.  My father was on the outside of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the gate, his right hand over the gate, bending the nail down.  Mr. Davis was on the wagon, inside the field, on the other side of the gate from my father; he had the gun when he got off the wagon; he shot daddy with it.  My father did not strike one of Mr. Davis' boys or strike at one of them.  Then my father went to the gate at the front yard and was opening it when the second shot was fired.  He was opening it with his left hand and that threw his back toward Mr. Davis, and at that time Mr. Davis shot him again.  Between those two shots, when I saw Mr. Davis loading his gun again, I says, 'Don't shoot, don't shoot,' and I went to telling daddy to run.  Davis did not answer me; he just shot again and my father fell.  My father didn't have anything there at the gate with him.  There wasn't a gun there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was indicted and tried for the murder of a farm owner, who was shot during a confrontation with defendant over a corn crop. Defendant worked as a share cropper on the decedent's farm. Defendant was convicted of murder. The trial court overruled defendant's motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that there was ample evidence to support the verdict and that the trial court's jury instructions were proper. A juror related to the prosecutor in the 9th degree was not subject to disqualification because O.C.G.A. &sect; 59-716 had reduced the requirement of relation to the 6th degree, and there was no requirement for a statute to mention prior inconsistent decisions. The farm owner's statement was admissible as a dying declaration even though he died 10 days after the statement was made because the question of the decedent's consciousness of impending death was based on his state of mind at the time his statement was made, not the length of time between the statement and the declarant's death. The trial court's charge on the dying declaration, pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 38-307, was proper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ollie Rutledge filed in the Civil Court of Fulton County against Norman Krasner, a petition which alleged substantially the following: The action was brought by the plaintiff as tenant against the defendant as landlord under the provisions of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 (act of January 30, 1942, of the U. S. Congress, C. 25, 56 Stat. 23 and amendments thereto).  On July 28, 1947, the plaintiff moved into the premises known as 491 Capitol Avenue, S. W.  In accordance with the said act, the U. S. Office of Price Administration had fixed the maximum rent per week of the apartment, including all services furnished, and though an increase was subsequently granted, nevertheless the defendant did demand and collect from the plaintiff during the period from July 28, 1947, to April 22, 1948, an overcharge of $ 265.  The defendant is, therefore, subject to damages in treble the amount of said overcharge, or $ 795, plus reasonable attorney's fees, for which amount the plaintiff prayed for a judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exception is to a judgment overruling the defendant's general demurrer.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant landlord sought review of a judgment of the Civil Court of Fulton County (Georgia), which overruled his general demurrer to plaintiff tenant's suit seeking treble damages for a violation of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 23 and amendments thereto, when the landlord collected from the tenant more than the maximum rent per week for an apartment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landlord alleged that the tenant's petition failed to set forth a cause of action, legal or constitutional, and failed to set forth any constitutional act or acts of Congress under which the action could be brought, or legally pursued. On appeal, the court held that the allegations of the tenant's petition were sufficient to set forth a cause of action, and the trial court did not err in overruling the landlord's demurrer. Where a statute was challenged as a whole, an attack would necessarily fail unless the statute was invalid in every part for some reason alleged. Thus, the court determined that because the constitutionality of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 had frequently been upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States, and further that certain parts of the statute had been held to be valid as against some of the reasons set forth in the landlord's demurrer, the court concluded that those grounds must fail because the statutes as a whole were not invalid in every part for some reason alleged.</SPAN></P>

The dry cleaner filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the ordinance's validity and seeking an injunction prohibiting the city for enforcing the ordinance against it. The trial court denied the city's demurrer to the complaint contending that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On appeal, the court reversed and dismissed the complaint. The court held that there was no actual case or controversy, and therefore the dry cleaner could not obtain declaratory relief, because the city had made no effort to enforce the ordinance against the dry cleaner. The action was based only upon the dry cleaner's apprehension that the city would enforce the ordinance against it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J. W. Barwick brought an action against H. H. Wind for libel, and in the petition alleged: On June 7, 1946, he was, and had been for several months prior thereto, the duly elected and active member of the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of Georgia, for Grady County; and the defendant was, and now is, the owner, manager, editor, and publisher of a weekly newspaper published in Cairo, Georgia, and circulated generally throughout Grady County.  On this date the defendant published in his newspaper the following article of and concerning the plaintiff:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;WATCH OUT, MR. BARWICK:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Grady Countians:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;It is noted that Rep. J. W. Barwick has made reference in The Messenger to the 'Farm Gasoline Tax Refund Bill' as 'my bill.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;In the interest of keeping the record straight, it should not be news to Rep. Barwick that the official records in Atlanta show that House Bill 733 which is known as the 'Farm Gasoline Tax Refund Bill' in question, was introduced and sponsored by Rep. Roughton of Washington County.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was further alleged that the article was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  false, and known to the defendant to be false, in that House Bill 733 was not the Farm Gasoline Tax Refund Bill, but that House Bill 367, introduced and sponsored by the plaintiff, was known as the Farm Gasoline Tax Refund Bill, and the bill to which he had made reference; that the false article was published in the newspaper, which has a general circulation throughout Grady County where his friends, constituents, and electors reside, with the intent and purpose to falsely, in print, denounce him as a person and as a public official, guilty of making an untrue statement of his acts and doings as a public servant, and of stating a falsehood to the people of the county who elected him to such public office; that as a result of the wilful and malicious publication of the false article, his good name and integrity as a public servant of Grady County was libeled, slandered, and defamed, and he was exposed to public ridicule and contempt.  He alleged general damages of $ 10,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant demurred to the petition, on the ground that it set forth no cause of action because the publication is not libelous as contemplated by the Code, &sect; 105-703; and on the further ground that the petition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shows on its face that it was prematurely brought because it was not alleged therein that the written notice, as required by the Code, &sect; 105-712, was given to the defendant at least five days prior to bringing the suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereupon the plaintiff, by an amendment which was allowed subject to demurrer, attacked the constitutionality of the statute requiring such notice (Ga. L. 1939, p. 343; Code, Ann. Supp., &sect;&sect; 105-712, 105-713), and alleged further as follows: &quot;16. Petitioner shows, however, that more than five days before the bringing of this action, and within the statute of limitations therefor, he gave to the defendant both an oral and written notice as to the appearance in his newspaper of the week of June 7, 1946, of the false statement, and petitioner informed the defendant that this statement was untrue and gave to him the true state of facts.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The legislator contended that O.C.G.A. &sect; 105-712 was unconstitutional but also alleged that he did give the required notice. The trial court dismissed the libel action. On appeal, the court did not pass on the constitutional question. It was immaterial to its decision. The legislator, by alleging that he gave the notice, fully complied with the provisions of the statute. The court further held that it could not say, as a matter of law, that the publication was not libelous within the definition in O.C.G.A. &sect;105-703 and would not have tended to injure the legislator's reputation as a person and as a public servant and expose him to public hatred, contempt, and ridicule.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injunction.  Before Judge Almand.  Fulton Superior Court.  December 6, 1947.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 15, 1945, Georgia Railroad &amp; Banking Company filed a petition in the Superior Court of Fulton County &quot;against M. E. Thompson, in his representative capacity as State Revenue Commissioner of the State of Georgia,&quot; seeking a declaratory judgment and injunction, the object of the suit being in part to prevent the defendant from assessing for ad valorem taxation two lines of railroad owned by the petitioner, one extending from Augusta to Atlanta, and one from Union Point to Athens, Georgia; it being alleged and contended that, under its charter and also under previous adjudications, these railroad properties are exempt from ad valorem taxation.  The petition was sanctioned and ordered filed, and a restraining order was issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 5, 1945, the defendant as thus sued filed a general and special demurrer to the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff offered two amendments, both of which were allowed on December 16, 1946, subject to demurrer or other objection.  One, designated as &quot;Amendment No. 1 of Dec. 16th, 1946,&quot; prayed that the petition be amended by striking&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from the first and unnumbered paragraph the allegation that said petition is &quot;against M. E. Thompson, in his representative capacity as State Revenue Commissioner of the State of Georgia,&quot; and by inserting in lieu thereof the allegation that said petition is &quot;against M. E. Thompson, who is State Revenue Commissioner of the State of Georgia.&quot; No objection was ever made to the allowance of this amendment.  The other amendment, designated as &quot;Amendment No. 2, of Dec. 16, 1946,&quot; sought to add a third line of railroad, extending from Camak to Warrenton, Georgia, as to which third line it was alleged that plaintiff is entitled to the same relief as prayed with respect to the other two lines.  In his order allowing this amendment subject to demurrer or objection, the judge enlarged his former restraining order so that it would include such third line, as prayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 24, 1947, on a &quot;plea for substitution of party&quot; filed by Glenn S. Phillips, who succeeded Thompson as State Revenue Commissioner, the judge entered an order substituting Glenn S. Phillips as a party defendant in the case and ordering that the cause proceed &quot;against the said Glenn S. Phillips in the same manner and with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the same consequences as if he had been the original defendant therein.&quot; Such &quot;plea for substitution of party&quot; alleged the appointment of Glenn S. Phillips as State Revenue Commissioner, and his adoption of the pleadings of the original defendant in said case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same date, November 24, 1947, the defendant Phillips filed objections to the allowance of the amendment of December 16, 1946, adding the third line of railroad, and to the inclusion of this line within the former restraining order.  Also on the same date, the defendant &quot;after all the amendments filed by the plaintiff have been allowed, subject to the objections to said amendments . . . adopts and renews its demurrers previously filed, both general and special, on each and every ground therein set out to the original petition, and also to the petition as amended, and says that said petition as amended should be dismissed for each and every reason set out in the original demurrers.&quot; Other grounds of demurrer, both general and special, were then stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same date the judge entered an opinion and judgment, (1) overruling &quot;the general and special demurrers, original and as made and renewed after the filing of amendments&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the plaintiff . . . on each and every ground,&quot; and (2) refusing &quot;to dissolve the restraining order heretofore granted.&quot; It was stated in the order that, &quot;Even if the case be construed as not being sufficient under the Declaratory Judgment Act, it does set forth a cause of action as a bill of peace.&quot; The defendant excepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In ground 3 of the general demurrer, it was expressly urged that the suit &quot;is in reality an action against the State, and the State has not consented to be made a party to this action or for the action to proceed against it.&quot; The same contention is expressly urged in this court by Phillips as plaintiff in error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition as amended contained substantially the following allegations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The defendant, as State Revenue Commissioner, is empowered by statute to assess railroad property for taxation by the State and its political subdivisions and to issue executions therefor, but is exceeding the authority given to him by the statutes of the State of Georgia and is acting unlawfully and in violation of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and of the United States, for the reasons hereinafter set out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. On August 28, 1945, the defendant wrote the following&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  letter jointly to the petitioner and to C. H. Phinizy, its president: &quot;Dear Sirs: The Georgia Railroad &amp; Banking Company having failed to file full and complete tax returns with the State Revenue Commission of the State of Georgia for the years 1939 through 1945, inclusive, you are hereby notified of such delinquency and are demanded to make full and complete tax returns to the State Revenue Commissioner within twenty days, as provided by law, covering all taxable property of said Georgia Railroad &amp; Banking Company, for State, County, Municipal and school taxes.  Yours very truly, Department of Revenue, M. E. Thompson, Commissioner.  Blanks will be furnished upon request.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The petitioner denies that, for the years 1939 through 1945 inclusive, or for any one of those years, it failed to file full and complete tax returns, but alleges that it has filed such returns and paid all taxes for which it was lawfully liable.  The petitioner has therefore declined to make any returns to the State Revenue Commissioner in addition to the returns already made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Nevertheless the defendant has threatened to and will, unless restrained by this court, assess against the petitioner ad valorem&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  taxes with respect to certain of its lines of railroad and their appurtenances, namely, the main line from Augusta to Atlanta; the Athens Branch, from Union Point to Athens (the approximate length of each being stated); both of which lines were constructed under and by virtue of the act of the General Assembly of Georgia approved December 21, 1833, hereinafter referred to; and the branch from Camak to Warrenton, a distance of four miles, which was constructed under and by virtue of the act of the General Assembly of Georgia assented to December 22, 1835, which amended the charter of the petitioner so as to authorize the construction of such branch line; said three lines of railroad being hereafter referred to as the &quot;charter tax lines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The petitioner's charter tax lines are not subject to ad valorem taxation, as will more fully hereinafter appear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The petitioner is a railroad corporation chartered as &quot;Georgia Railroad Company&quot; by the State of Georgia by special act of the General Assembly approved December 21, 1833, the name of said company having been changed to &quot;Georgia Railroad &amp; Banking Company&quot; by a special act of the General Assembly approved December 18, 1835.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. By&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  section 15 of said act approved December 21, 1833, which is now and at all times since its approval has been a part of the petitioner's charter, it is enacted as follows: &quot;The stock of the said company and its branches shall be exempt from taxation for and during the term of seven years from and after the completion of the said railroads or any one of them; and after that, shall be subject to a tax not exceeding one half percent per annum on the net proceeds of their investments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The provision of the petitioner's charter as above quoted is applicable to the petitioner's said charter tax lines, all of which were completed many years prior to 1939.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. In addition to its charter tax lines, the petitioner owns other lines of railroad, herein referred to as its &quot;general tax lines,&quot; to which the quoted provisions of its charter are not applicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. The petitioner has always paid taxes on the general tax lines on the ad valorem basis.  The assessment in question in this case is with respect to the charter tax lines of the petitioner.  The petitioner has never paid ad valorem taxes with respect to the charter tax lines, but these lines have always been taxed on their net income&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under the provisions of the petitioner's charter quoted in paragraph 9 hereof.  The petitioner has regularly each year made tax returns as required by law of the charter tax lines on the basis of the net income, and said returns have been accepted by the State tax authorities, and said returns having been accepted by the State and the tax paid thereon, they cannot now be opened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The net income payable under the charter is not the rental received by the petitioner from its lessees, but is the net income from the operation of the charter tax lines.  The net income of the charter tax lines has always been computed in this way.  The taxes now payable on one-half of one percent of net income are very much less than the taxes payable on the ad valorem basis at the prevailing tax rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. On May 7, 1881, the petitioner, in the exercise of the power conferred upon it by its said charter, leased its railroad properties to William M. Wadley for the term of 99 years from April 1, 1881, and Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company and Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company are Wadley's successors in interest to said lease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. The defendant claims that, in assessing the taxes here complained&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of, he is proceeding under the act of the General Assembly of Georgia approved February 28, 1874 (Ga. L. 1874, p. 107), entitled &quot;An Act to amend the tax laws of this State, so far as the same relate to railroad companies, and to define the liability of such companies to taxation, and to repeal so much of the charters of such companies, respectively, as may conflict with the provisions of this Act&quot; (Code, &sect;&sect; 92-2602, 92-2603, 92-2604), and under article 1, section 3, paragraph 3 of the Constitution &quot;as amended August 7, 1945,&quot; which reads: &quot;All exemptions from taxation heretofore granted in corporate charters are declared to be henceforth null and void;&quot; although the Constitution of 1877 provided &quot;No . . . law impairing the obligation of contracts . . . shall be passed,&quot; and this provision was retained &quot;in the Constitution as amended August 7, 1945.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. That part of section 15 of the petitioner's charter, quoted in paragraph 9 hereof, is an irrevocable and inviolable contract between the State of Georgia and the petitioner, and can not be modified or changed by any subsequent legislative act of the State or by any subsequent provision in the State Constitution.  The said act of 1874, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and article 1, section 3, paragraph 3 of the Constitution, referred to in paragraph 14 hereof, are unconstitutional and void, in that they are contrary to article 1, section 10, paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the United States, which provides that &quot;No State . . . shall pass any . . . law impairing the obligation of contracts,&quot; in that said act of 1874 and said provision of the Constitution of Georgia (1945) undertake to subject the charter lines of the petitioner to ad valorem taxation in violation of the aforesaid provision of section 15 of the petitioner's charter.  For the same reason, said act of 1874 is unconstitutional and void, because it violates the above stated provision of the Constitution of Georgia of 1877, as amended August 7, 1945, declaring that &quot;No . . . law impairing the obligation of contracts . . . shall be passed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For these reasons the assessment which the defendant has threatened to make and which, unless restrained, he will make against the petitioner for ad valorem taxes on the petitioner's charter tax lines for the years 1939-45, inclusive, are not authorized by law or by the Constitution, and the acts and things threatened by the defendant are illegal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and in violation of the rights of the petitioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. If the defendant is proceeding under any other act of the General Assembly, or under any provision of any Constitution of the State of Georgia, passed or adopted subsequently to December 21, 1833, any such other act or constitutional provision is null and void because in violation of article 1, section 3, paragraph 2 of the Constitution of Georgia (contract clause), in that it seeks to subject the charter tax lines of the petitioner to ad valorem taxation in violation of the aforesaid provision of section 15 of the petitioner's charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17. &quot;Article 1, section 3, paragraph 3 of the Constitution of Georgia of 1877, as amended August 7, 1945,&quot; which provides, &quot;All exemptions from taxation heretofore granted in corporate charters are declared to be henceforth null and void,&quot; is itself unconstitutional and void when applied to the taxation of the charter tax lines of the petitioner on an ad valorem basis, because the same is contrary to article 1, section 10, paragraph 1 of the United States Constitution, which provides that &quot;No State shall . . . pass any . . . law impairing the obligation of contracts,&quot; because it seeks to subject&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the charter tax lines of the petitioner to ad valorem taxation in violation of section 15 of the petitioner's charter.  In other words, the State of Georgia can not avoid the Constitution of the United States by repealing its own contracts or by declaring its own contracts void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">18. The said provision in the Constitution of Georgia, which provides that &quot;All exemptions from taxation heretofore granted in corporate charters are declared to be henceforth null and void,&quot; is by its own terms not applicable in this case.  It is in terms prospective and not retrospective.  The defendant is seeking to tax the petitioner for ad valorem taxes on its charter tax lines for the years 1939 to 1945, both inclusive.  Said provision of the Constitution does not purport to be retroactive in operation, or to declare any exemption from taxation theretofore granted to be void ab initio, but only to declare them &quot;henceforth null and void.&quot; Accordingly, said Constitution does not purport to authorize and does not authorize the act threatened by the defendant; nor does the same purport to apply to the provisions of the petitioner's charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">19. In 1874, shortly after passage of the above-mentioned act of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  February 28, 1874, which purported to tax all railroad companies on an ad valorem basis and to repeal the charters of such companies as might conflict with the provisions of said act, the Comptroller-General of Georgia issued executions against the petitioner for taxes claimed under said act.  To these executions the petitioner filed an affidavit of illegality in the Superior Court of Fulton County, as provided in said act, and on the hearing thereof the superior court sustained the affidavit.  The judgment of the superior court was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Georgia in State of Georgia v. Georgia Railroad &amp; Banking Co., 54 Ga. 424. The petitioner then quotes headnotes 1, 2, and 3 of that decision.  &quot;Petitioner pleads the judgment in that case as res adjudicata of the issues in this case, and as an estoppel by judgment of said issues, to wit, that the lines described in this petition as charter tax lines are not subject to ad valorem taxes, but are taxable only on their net income under the special provisions of petitioner's charter; and the judgment being of this honorable court, petitioner prays the court to take judicial notice thereof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">20. On January 7, 1904, the petitioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  filed its bill in equity in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of Georgia against William A. Wright, in his official capacity as Comptroller-General of the State of Georgia, alleging, among other things, that the defendant claimed, first, that the petitioner should pay a direct tax on the value of its railroad and equipment in excess of $ 4,156,000, and second, that the petitioner should pay a tax on its franchises, said second claim being made under an act of the legislature approved December 17, 1902, entitled &quot;An Act to provide for and require the payment of taxes on franchises, and to prescribe the method for the return and payment of said taxes,&quot; and that the Comptroller-General &quot;is threatening and is about to proceed to collect said illegal taxes.&quot; The petitioner in said bill averred that said purpose and attempt to collect said taxes are illegal and void, because the petitioner's charter is a contract between the petitioner and the State of Georgia, and by said contract the State bound itself to exact no taxes from the petitioner on account of its investments in the charter tax lines of railroad aforesaid exceeding one-half of one percent of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  net earnings of said investments, and said threatened action of said Comptroller-General and said act of the General Assembly of December 17, 1902, would impair the obligation of said contract, and are unconstitutional under paragraph 1 of article 10 of the amendment to the United States Constitution.  The petitioner prayed that it be adjudged that it is liable only for a tax to the State not exceeding one-half of one percent of the petitioner's investments in its railroad, and that the defendant Comptroller-General be enjoined from proceeding to collect any other tax from the petitioner.  On July 3, 1907, said circuit court entered a decree in said case enjoining the Comptroller-General as prayed.  The Comptroller-General appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States from said decree, and by a decision rendered February 21, 1910, 216 U.S. 420 (30 Sup. Ct. 242, 54 L. ed. 544), that court affirmed the decree in so far as it related to the property referred to as the petitioner's charter tax lines, and reversed it only in so far as it related to the petitioner's branch line from Barnett to Washington, Georgia, which petitioner does not now include in its charter tax lines.  Excerpts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from the decision of the United States Supreme Court are contained in this paragraph of the petition, which paragraph concludes as follows: &quot;Petitioner attaches hereto as Exhibit A a copy of the entire record of said case [in the said Circuit Court and in the United States Supreme Court], and pleads the final judgment in said case as res adjudicata of the issues in this case that the lines described in this petition as charter tax lines are not subject to ad valorem taxes, but are taxable only on their net income under the special provisions of petitioner's charter, and petitioner also pleads said judgment as an estoppel upon said issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">21. By section 78 of the act approved August 28, 1931 (Ga. L. 1931, pp. 7 et seq.), a State Revenue Commission was created, consisting of the Comptroller-General and two Commissioners, and by section 4 of the act approved January 3, 1938 (Ga. L., Ex. Sess., 1937-38, pp. 77 et seq.), the State Revenue Commissioner was vested with all the power and authority, and was required to perform all the duties formerly vested in the State Revenue Commission, with certain exceptions not here material, and was also vested with all power and authority and was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  required to perform all the duties relating to taxation theretofore vested in any State administrative official or State department, so that now all duties with respect to the taxes assessed against the petitioner have devolved upon the defendant in this case, who in these respects is the successor in office of the former Comptroller-General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">22. The petitioner desires to contest the effort of the defendant to assess said property for taxation as hereinbefore set out, but is advised by counsel, and therefore alleges, that there are grave doubts and uncertainties as to the method to be followed in so doing, for the following reasons:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) The petitioner is advised that the defendant is proceeding under the act of 1918, page 232 (Chapter 92-61 of the Code), which provides for assessments against property owners failing to return or grossly undervaluing their property, and which provides, in &sect; 92-6104, that a taxpayer who disputes the taxability of his property may raise the question by petition in equity in the Superior Court of Fulton County.  Chapter 92-61 of the Code may not be applicable in this case because:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) The petitioner has not omitted to return its property for taxation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the years 1939-1945, inclusive, and has not undervalued the property which it has returned for those years; and because:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) The act of 1918, page 232, or, at least, &sect; 92-6104 of the Code, may have been repealed by the act of 1937-38, Extra Session, page 77, providing in section 44 for review by the Board of Tax Appeals of assessments made by the State Revenue Commission, and said provisions of said act of 1937-38 may, in turn, have been repealed, as to questions involving taxability, by the provisions of the act of 1941, page 200, withdrawing from the Board of Tax Appeals the right to review assessments by the State Revenue Commission except those entered by the commissioner on tax returns for ad valorem taxation required to be made to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) Both the act of 1918 and &quot;the applicable provisions&quot; of the act of 1937-38, page 77 (if the same have not been repealed by the act of 1941, page 200), may have been repealed by the act of 1943, page 204, which provides for a review of assessments made by the State Revenue Commissioner by appeal to the superior court of the county in which is located the taxpayer's principal place of doing business or in which the taxpayer's chief or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  highest corporate officer resident in this State maintains his office, which, in the petitioner's case, would be the Superior Court of Chatham County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(c) The act of 1943, page 204, provides that nothing therein contained &quot;shall be construed to deprive a taxpayer against whom an execution for taxes has been issued under an assessment by the State Revenue Commissioner of the right to resist enforcement of the same by affidavit of illegality.&quot; The act of 1931, page 7 (Code, &sect; 92-7301), gave to a taxpayer the right to test the question whether a tax assessed by the State Revenue Commissioner was legally due, by affidavit of illegality, but the petitioner is advised that doubt exists as to whether that act was repealed by the act of 1937-1938 Extra Session, page 77, and, therefore, as to whether the petitioner would have the right to test the question whether this tax is legally due by affidavit of illegality.  If said act of 1931 has been repealed, then there is doubt as to whether the petitioner would have the right to test by affidavit of illegality the question whether the taxes involved in this case are legally due, because the only other right given to a taxpayer to file an affidavit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of illegality is to be found in Code &sect; 92-3604 (&sect; 92-2604?), and it has been held by the Supreme Court that such remedy is only open to taxpayers who have made their returns.  While the petitioner contends that it has made returns of all its property subject to ad valorem taxation, the defendant contends that it has not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">23. For the reasons set forth in the foregoing paragraph, the petitioner's remedy to contest its liability for the assessment which the defendant proposes to make, by or through any statutory proceeding or proceedings at law, is highly doubtful and uncertain, and the petitioner can not safely risk an adjudication as to the proper remedy by following either the procedure outlined in &sect; 92-6104 of the Code, or the procedure outlined by the act of 1938 as it has been amended, for the reason that, once the assessment is made, the taxpayer must present the appeal under the act of 1938, as amended, within thirty days.  Thus if the petitioner seeks to contest the taxability of said property by a petition in equity, as authorized by &sect; 92-6104 of the Code, and it should be determined that that section and the procedure there authorized have been repealed or superseded by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the act of 1938, it would then be too late to appeal from the assessment.  On the other hand, if the petitioner should appeal from the assessment within thirty days, and it should thereafter be determined that the petitioner's remedy was by following the procedure outlined in &sect; 92-6104 of the Code, with the result that the petitioner's appeal would be dismissed, the petitioner would then be in danger of its petition in equity being barred on account of laches.  &quot;If petitioner should thus be placed in a position in which neither the procedure outlined in Code &sect; 92-6104 nor that outlined in &sect;&sect; 92-8426-d and 92-8446 was open to it, it is doubtful, for the reasons hereinbefore stated, whether petitioner could proceed by affidavit of illegality, so that petitioner might be remediless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">24. An actual controversy exists between the petitioner and the defendant as to the matters and things set forth in this petition.  The petitioner contends that its charter tax lines are not subject to ad valorem taxation by the State or any of its political subdivisions and are not subject to any other form of taxation save that provided by the petitioner's charter, and that this is true despite the act&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of 1874, and article 1, section 3, paragraph 3, of &quot;the Constitution of 1877, as amended August 7, 1945.&quot; The defendant contends that under the Constitution of 1877 and under said act of 1874 the charter tax lines of the petitioner are subject to ad valorem taxation to the same extent as other lines of the petitioner upon which it has already paid ad valorem taxes.  The defendant further contends that, whether or not the charter tax lines were subject to ad valorem taxation under the Constitution of 1877, or under said act of 1874, said charter tax lines are subject to such ad valorem taxation under the Constitution of 1945, and that said Constitution is retrospective and retroactive in operation and subjects said charter tax lines to ad valorem taxation for years antedating the adoption of the Constitution of 1945, as well as for future years.  The petitioner contends that said Constitution of 1877 as amended in 1945 is by its terms prospective only in operation and effect, with the result that it does not purport to subject said charter tax lines to taxation for years antedating the amendment of 1945, and that in so far as it undertakes or seeks to subject them to taxation for future&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  years, it is unconstitutional because violative of article 1, section 10, paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the United States, for all of the reasons hereinbefore stated.  With respect to the years 1939 to 1945 the controversy between the petitioner and the defendant is not only actual but acute, in that the defendant has stated his purpose to assess taxes against the petitioner for all of said years, has threatened to do so, and will do so unless enjoined.  As to future years, the controversy is actual because the defendant has threatened to and will assess taxes against said charter tax lines for all future years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">25. The defendant is proceeding to assess the petitioner's property for ad valorem taxation for the years 1939 through 1945, for State, county, municipal and school taxes, and will so assess same unless the rights of the parties are determined before said assessment can be made, and, if they are not determined before said assessment can be made (and it is most unlikely that they can be), the defendant will proceed to issue executions against the petitioner for the ad valorem taxes which he claims to be due for each of the seven years involved, and to levy said executions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the petitioner's property unless he is enjoined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">26. If the defendant is not enjoined as hereinafter prayed, he will proceed to assess the petitioner's charter tax lines for ad valorem taxation for the years 1939-1945, inclusive.  If the petitioner's remedy against said assessment should be held in this proceeding to be under the provisions of the act of 1938 as amended, the petitioner's appeal from said assessment must be entered within thirty days, failing which the petitioner will be remediless.  It is, therefore, necessary that the defendant be restrained from assessing said property in order that the present status may be maintained and the petitioner's rights preserved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">27. Wherefore, the petitioner brings this suit, as authorized by the act of the General Assembly of Georgia of 1945, known as the Declaratory Judgment Act, and shows that it is entitled to have this court determine and declare the rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to the controversy hereinbefore described, and particularly with reference to the taxability of the property referred to in this petition which the defendant proposes to and will assess for taxation as herein alleged, and that it&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***25]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is also entitled to such other and further relief as will eventually preserve and prevent violation and impairment of the contracts herein described.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waiving discovery, the petitioner prays:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) That the court will determine, adjudicate and declare:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) That the petitioner's charter tax lines hereinbefore described are exempt from ad valorem taxation for the years 1939-1945, both inclusive, and are not otherwise taxable except in the manner and method provided in the petitioner's charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) That the defendant is without authority of law to enter ad valorem assessments against the petitioner or said property, and that such assessments, if undertaken to be entered, will be void for all of the reasons stated in this petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(c) That the judgments entered in the cases heretofore decided by the Supreme Courts of Georgia and of the United States, which are referred to in the foregoing petition, are res adjudicata and constitute a final and conclusive determination forever binding upon the State of Georgia and its public officials as to the taxability of said property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(d) That the court determine and declare that the defendant and his successors in office and all persons who are&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***26]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or may hereafter be charged with the duty of assessing and collecting taxes within the State of Georgia or any political subdivision thereof, should be perpetually enjoined from assessing said property for such taxation or endeavoring in any manner to collect ad valorem taxes thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That, if the decree of this court should be such that the rights and legal relations of the parties hereto can only be adjudicated in another proceeding now provided by the laws of Georgia, then this court will determine, adjudicate, and declare whether the taxability of the petitioner's charter tax lines can be determined by petition in equity to the Superior Court of Fulton County under the provisions of &sect; 92-6104 of the Code, or by appeal from the defendant's assessment to the superior court of the county in which is located the petitioner's principal place of doing business or in which the petitioner's chief or highest corporate officer, resident in this State, maintains an office, &quot;under the provisions of sections 92-8446-d and 8446 of the Code of 1933 [&sect;&sect; 92-8426.4, 92-8446, Ann. Code Supp.?], and also whether petitioner has the additional right to determine said question by affidavit of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***27]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  illegality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. That pending a determination of the questions presented by this petition and the declaration of the rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to the taxability of said property and the remedy to be pursued by the petitioner in contesting an assessment thereof by the defendant, the defendant as State Revenue Commissioner, and his successors in office, be restrained and enjoined from assessing said property or any of same for ad valorem taxation for the years 1939 to 1945, inclusive, or any future years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. That pending a hearing and until further order of court, the defendant be temporarily restrained as prayed for in the foregoing paragraph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. For process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. For rule nisi as to injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. For general relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downing Musgrove having succeeded Glenn S.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant commissioner sought review of a judgment from the Fulton County Superior Court (Georgia), which granted an injunction to plaintiff railroad in its action to enjoin the commissioner from the assessment of ad valorem tax against the railroad's property. The commissioner claimed that the trial court erred in having overruled its demurrer, which asserted that the action was against the state and the state had not consented to be sued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The railroad filed a declaratory judgment action against the commissioner that sought an injunction to prevent the commissioner from the assessment of ad valorem tax against the railroad's property. The commissioner filed a demurrer that claimed that the action was actually against the state and the state had not consented to be sued. The trial court overruled the demurrer and granted injunctive relief and the commissioner sought review. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for the dismissal of the complaint, and held that: (1) an action to enjoin the execution of an unconstitutional statute is an action against the official, but an action that involved the property rights of the state was an action against the state; (2) although the action was nominally against the commissioner, its judgment would control the action of the state; and (3) the state had not consented to be sued.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STATEMENT OF FACTS BY JENKINS, CHIEF JUSTICE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a more detailed statement of the facts in this quo warranto proceeding see Estes v. Jones, 202 Ga. 749 (44 S. E. 2d, 550), where, when the case was previously before this court, it was held, in ruling on demurrers to the respondent's answer, that allegations to the effect that the act of the General Assembly (Ga. L. 1943, pp. 271, 272) was &quot;inconsistent&quot; with the provisions of art.  VIII, sec. V, par. I of the Constitution of Georgia, and the allegation that Code &sect; 32-902 was a &quot;nullity,&quot; &quot;presented no question for judicial determination, since they fail to point out wherein the act or the Code section is inconsistent with the constitutional provisions, or wherein the Code section is invalid;&quot; and the court thereupon ruled that general demurrers to the respondent's answer should have been sustained.  Before the remittitur of this court had been made the judgment of the court below, the respondent filed amendments to his answer, in which he undertook to specify the particulars in which said act was inconsistent with the constitutional provision above&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  referred to, and in what manner said Code section was invalid.  The trial court sustained renewed demurrers to the amendment with respect to the allegations as to the invalidity of Code &sect; 32-902, to which order no exception is taken.  The court also overruled additional demurrers to the respondent's answer, which, by amendment, particularized its attack upon the constitutionality of the above-cited act of the General Assembly, to which order ruling said act to be unconstitutional the relator excepts.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a quo warranto proceeding, relator challenged the order of the DeKalb Superior Court (Georgia), which overruled its demurrers to respondent's amended answer particularizing its attack upon the constitutionality of O.C.G.A. &sect; 32-902 and ruled the act to be unconstitutional. On a previous appeal, the court found that the general demurrers to respondent's answer should have been sustained. Respondent then amended his answer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondent contended that the amendments to O.C.G.A. &sect; 32-902 were unconstitutional because they were inconsistent with Ga. Const. art. VIII, &sect; V(I). Respondent also claimed that the amended was a special law covering a subject matter already covered by a general law and, therefore, in violation of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; IV(I). Reversing, the court concluded that O.C.G.A. &sect; 32-902 was constitutional. The court noted that there was a presumption in favor of the constitutionality of statutes. Under Ga. Const. art. VIII, &sect; V(I), a board of education was created for each county. This did not conflict with the existing statute, O.C.G.A. &sect; 32-902 et seq. The legislature amended O.C.G.A. &sect; 32-902 to limit the terms of the members of the boards, to limit the districts from which they could be elected, and to prohibit school district trustees from serving on the county board. The court concluded that the amendment provided additional qualifications for eligibility and were not inconsistent with the constitutional provision.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">F. J. Hahne filed a petition on January 8, 1948, in the Superior Court of Chatham County against Edward A. Dutton, Mayor of the Town of Savannah Beach, Tybee Island, John A. Peters and others, as Councilmen of the town, Perry Brannen and others, as Registrars of Chatham County, and Henry M. Buckley, Clerk of Council of the Town of Savannah Beach, Tybee Island, seeking a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of an act approved March 22, 1947 (Ga. L. 1947, pp. 593-601), amending the charter of Savannah Beach, Tybee Island.  The petition, as amended, alleged: Under the act of 1939, amending the charter of the Town of Savannah Beach, Tybee Island (Ga. L. 1939, pp. 1366-1375), the right to vote in the town and to hold office included persons owning real property in the town and bona fide residents thereof.  The petitioner is a resident of the City of Savannah, but an owner of real property in the Town of Savannah Beach, Tybee Island.  The act of 1939 was the prevailing law at the time the petitioner became a registered voter in the town, and the present mayor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and councilmen were elected in an election held under the provisions of the 1939 act.  Under the act of 1947, supra, the right to register and vote and to hold office in the election to be held the first Monday in April, 1948, is limited to bona fide residents of the Town of Savannah Beach, Tybee Island; and if the act of 1947 is a valid and constitutional act, the petitioner and other persons now on the voters' list by virtue of being owners of real property in the town will be stricken therefrom.  The enrolled bill (1947 amendment) does not contain either a copy of the publisher's notice certified to by the publisher or accompanied by an affidavit of the author to the effect that the bill has been published as provided by law; and under the Constitution of Georgia, art. 3, sec. 7, par. 15, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the case of Smith v. McMichael, 203 Ga. 74 (45 S. E. 2d, 431), the act is null and void.  Because of the uncertainty that has arisen as to the validity of the act of 1947, the following controversies have arisen: Whether or not the primary provided for under the act of 1939 has been abolished, and whether or not the Executive Committee charged with the duty&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under the law of calling a primary is still cast with that duty, or whether the Executive Committee under the act of 1947 has ceased to exist; whether or not it is the duty of the Clerk of Council to open his registration books for the benefit of residents of Chatham County owning property at Savannah Beach, Tybee Island; whether or not residents of Chatham County owning property in Savannah Beach, Tybee Island, but not being actual residents thereof, still have the right to vote or to hold office, and what the duty of the Clerk of Council is in relation thereto; whether or not it is the duty of the Board of Registrars of Chatham County to strike from the registration rolls the names of all persons not registered as voters under the terms of the 1947 act; whether the act of 1947, providing that all six councilmen shall be bona fide residents of the town, has superseded the act of 1939, requiring that three must be property owners and three residents; whether or not the 1947 act has been validly passed and properly engrossed; whether the Executive Committee provided for under the act of 1939 still remains and is to be voted upon in the next election, or whether the 1947 act has abolished&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Executive Committee.  Unless the act of 1947 is held to be invalid, no primary can be held in March, 1948, under the 1939 amendment, and much confusion would result as to the rights of people to vote and hold office.  The same uncertainty and confusion would arise in reference to the regular election to be held in April, 1948.  A great state of chaos and confusion will result from the acts of newly elected officials in the collection of taxes and the punishment of persons charged with crimes.  By one amendment, Savannah Beach, Tybee Island, was made a party defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition, as amended, prayed that: The court entertain jurisdiction of the matter and render a declaratory judgment determining whether or not the act of 1947 was validly enacted, and whether or not the act has become the law of this State and is the governing act regulating the right to register, vote, and hold office in the municipality; the court determine the rights of the petitioner in reference to his right to register, vote, and hold office; the court pass such necessary orders and decrees to enforce its judgment; any interested person of Chatham County be permitted to intervene in the case; rule nisi&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  issue; the Attorney General be served; the court grant such equitable relief as may be necessary in regard to elections and government of the municipality pending the determination of the issues.  On the same date the court issued an order to show cause on January 30, and allowed any citizen of Chatham County to intervene in the cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 27, 1948, John A. Bergman filed an intervention in resistance to the petition, alleging that he is a property owner, taxpayer, and bona fide resident of the Town of Savannah Beach, Tybee Island, and is entitled to voting and office-holding privileges under the act of 1947.  The intervention contended that the act of 1947 was duly passed, duly approved by the Governor, and became a valid act, and there was a substantial compliance with all of the requirements of the Constitution and Code.  Attached to the intervention was a photostatic copy of the bill to which was attached the affidavit of the publisher that notice of the bill was published in the Morning News Inc., a newspaper of general circulation in Chatham County.  Also attached was a photostatic copy of the enrolled act, on which the notation, &quot;Certificate of Publication Attached to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Original Bill,&quot; appeared prior to the signatures of the officers of the Senate and House of Representatives and approval of the Governor.  The intervenor set out his contentions as to why the 1947 act was constitutional.  The intervention, as amended, was allowed to be filed, and Bergman made a party to the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 29, 1948, William Edward Sickel filed an intervention in support of the prayers of the original petition of Hahne.  He alleged that he was a property owner and taxpayer in the Town of Savannah Beach, Tybee Island, resident elsewhere in Chatham County.  By proper order of the court he was made a party to the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 12, 1948, the court passed an order, reciting that pending the determination of the validity of the 1947 amendment to the charter of Savannah Beach, Tybee Island, registration of voters under both the 1939 amendment and 1947 amendment should be allowed, the nonresident voters to be stricken from the permanent voters' list in the event the 1947 act be finally adjudicated to be valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 27, 1948, F. J. Hahne filed a demurrer to the intervention of John A. Bergman, and moved to strike the portion of the intervention setting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  out the contents of the original bill, and the certified copy of the original bill attached as an exhibit, on the ground that only the enrolled bill can be examined to determine the validity of the act, and that the contents of the original bill are inadmissible.  Other allegations of the intervention were attacked on the ground of being conclusions of the pleader, irrelevant, inadmissible and immaterial, in view of the ruling of the Supreme Court in Smith v. McMichael, supra. The demurrer was overruled by the court on January 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants in the original action, Edward A. Dutton and the members of the Council and Clerk of the Council, filed a general demurrer to the petition of Hahne on January 29, which was overruled by the court on January 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials of the municipality, in their answer to the petition of Hahne, admitted the facts set out in the petition, but did not admit the conclusion that the 1947 act is invalid, and showed that in their capacity as officials of the municipality that they were required to recognize the 1947 act until it is declared invalid by the court.  They prayed instruction by the court in the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The municipality of Savannah Beach, Tybee&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Island, in its answer, admitted the facts set forth in the petition, but did not admit the conclusion that the 1947 act is not a valid act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Registrars of Chatham County, in their answer, admitted the facts set forth in the opinion, but did not admit that the 1947 act has been rendered null and void because the enrolled copy failed to show that it was properly advertised, other than by the statement appearing thereon as shown in the exhibit attached to the petition.  They showed how a decision as to the validity of the law would affect their duties as registrars, and requested instruction from the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing on the cause, on January 30, counsel for the parties agreed on certain stipulations of facts.  The allegations of the parties as to their residence and interest in the case were admitted.  It was agreed that the certified copy of the enrolled act was correct, and admission of it was without objection.  The admission of the copy of the original bill was objected to by counsel for the original petitioner.  It was agreed that a state of confusion existed as to the duties of the town officials and the registrars in regard to registration lists and qualifications for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  voting in the municipality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the declaratory judgment rendered by the court, it was held that the act of 1947, amending the charter of Savannah Beach, Tybee Island, is unconstitutional and void, as violative of the provisions of the Constitution, art. 3, sec. 7, par. 15.  It was further ordered that, if the case should be appealed to either of the appellate courts, there should be no election in Savannah Beach, Tybee Island, until judgment is rendered by the proper appellate court; that, upon final judgment being rendered by the appellate court, an election shall be called by the Mayor and Aldermen of Savannah Beach, Tybee Island, to be held within not less than twenty days nor more than thirty days after the date of the entering of the remittitur on such judgment, the election to be held in accordance with the act that is held valid and effective by the appellate court, and in accordance with any direction given by such court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intervenor, John A. Bergman, brought a bill of exceptions to this court, naming himself as plaintiff in error, and all of the other parties in the case as defendants in error.  He excepted to the rulings of the court holding the act of 1947 to be invalid. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also sought leave to file a request for review, modification, distinction, and reversal of the decisions in Smith v. McMichael, supra; Cox v. Hapeville, 203 Ga. 263 (46 S. E. 2d, 122), and any other cases following the decisions in the two cases named.  The leave to file was allowed, and the petition filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward A. Dutton, John A. Peters, Morris Slotin, William S. Lovell, Mitchell R. Young, James A. Brown, B. P. Hosti, Henry M. Buckley, and Savannah Beach, Tybee Island, filed a cross-bill of exceptions, naming themselves as plaintiffs in error, and naming John A. Bergman, William Edward Sickel, and F. J. Hahne as defendants in error.  They assigned error on the order overruling their demurrer, and to that portion of the order of the court ordering the calling of an election between twenty and thirty days after the remittitur of this court is received in the lower court.  It is contended that the judge of the superior court is not authorized to order an election of officials on any other date than that fixed in the charter of the municipality as it existed prior to 1947.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff in error town resident excepted to a judgment of the Superior Court of Chatham County (Georgia), declaring an act unconstitutional, in an action by defendant in error, a non-resident of the town, against defendants in error, town, mayor, and councilmen, for a declaratory judgment as to the act's constitutionality. Defendants in error cross-appealed the portion of the judgment barring a scheduled election in the event of an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The non-resident commenced an action to determine the constitutionality of a town act, which restricted the right to vote in the town to bona fide residents only. The constitutionality of the act was at issue because the act did not contain proof that the bill had been published as provided by law. The resident intervened, contending that the act was valid, and introduced evidence of publication. The trial court declared that the act was unconstitutional and void. It further ordered that there be no election in the town until a final judgment was rendered on appeal. Both parties appealed. The court held that the trial court properly determined that the act was unconstitutional. Where the enrolling clerk failed to copy the proof of advertising attached to the original bill into the enrolled act, no form of proof was permitted to be introduced later so as to have prevented the enrolled act from being in conflict with the Georgia Constitution. However, the trial court erred in barring any elections until resolution of the case on appeal. That the trial court's judgment may have been reversed was not sufficient cause for enjoining the holding of an election on the date provided by law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff citizens brought an action in the Colquitt Superior Court (Georgia) against defendants, an alderman and certain putative town officials, seeking an injunction to restrain defendants from acting in an official capacity or imposing license fees on the citizens' businesses on the ground that they did not hold the offices legally. The superior court overruled defendants' demurrers and granted the injunction, and defendants excepted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The citizens alleged that because of how the alderman had appointed them, his fellow defendants were not the legally constituted mayor and council of the town. In considering the matter, the court ruled that the action for an injunction had been improperly brought. The citizens did not allege an irreparable injury but only challenged the right of defendants to hold the offices. The claims about the license fees and business interference were incidental to the action's main purpose. The court concluded that the citizens had a legally cognizable interest within the meaning of O.C.G.A. &sect; 64-201 that would have entitled them to bring a proceeding in the nature of quo warranto, which would have been adequate to challenge the right of defendants to hold the public offices. The court noted that under O.C.G.A. &sect; 37-120, equity did not take cognizance of a plain legal right where an adequate and complete remedy was provided by law. In addition, the citizens did not otherwise allege sufficient facts to bring the action within the jurisdiction of a court of equity. Accordingly, the court ruled that the superior court had erred in overruling defendants' general demurrer to the petition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An indictment returned by the grand jury of Fulton County and containing five counts charged Homer L. Loomis Jr. and Emory Burke with violations of the Code, &sect; 26-4902, under which &quot;Acting as peace officer without authority&quot; is made a misdemeanor; the terms of this section being as follows: &quot;Any person who shall, without authority, exercise or attempt to exercise the functions of, or hold himself out to anyone as, a deputy sheriff, marshal, policeman, constable, or other peace officer or detective shall be guilty of a misdemeanor: Provided, that nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to interfere with the police powers granted to conductors of passenger trains, nor shall this and the preceding section apply in times of riot or unusual disturbance, or in other instances provided for by law.&quot; Loomis demurred to the indictment, his demurrer was overruled, and he excepted pendente lite.  He also filed what he designated a &quot;plea of double jeopardy,&quot; which the judge dismissed on an oral motion and demurrer of the State, and to this ruling Loomis again excepted pendente lite.  On the trial, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the jury returned a verdict finding Loomis guilty on three of the five counts, to wit, counts 2, 4, and 5, and not guilty on counts 1 and 3.  Sentences were imposed in accordance with the findings on counts 2, 4, and 5.  His motion for a new trial, based on the usual general grounds, and numerous special grounds added by amendment, was overruled, and he excepted, assigning error on his exceptions pendente lite, as mentioned above, and on the refusal of a new trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the bill of exceptions, which was returned to this court, it is stated: &quot;The Supreme Court, and not the Court of Appeals, has jurisdiction hereof because questions are raised herein under the Georgia and United States Constitutions and as to the constitutionality of Georgia statutes (grounds of amended motion, 1, 4, 13, 15, 16a, 16b, 16d, 19, 31).&quot; The following statement will indicate the general nature of these grounds, although they are mentioned here in a somewhat different order from the enumeration in the bill of exceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special ground 1 of the motion for new trial assigned error on the admission of certain testimony as to the defendant's belief in the Bible, over stated objections of the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ground 13 assigned as error the oath administered to the jurors trying the defendant, whereby they swore to be guided by the evidence, instead of an oath whereby they would have been sworn to be guided by the evidence and the movant's statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special ground 15 assigned error on the propounding of the first of the three voir dire questions.  &quot;Have you from having seen the crime committed or having heard any of the testimony delivered on oath, formed and expressed any opinion in regard to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner at the bar?&quot; The assignment of error was that the phrase, &quot;alleged crime,&quot; should have been used instead of the word &quot;crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special ground 16b assigned error on the judge's charge on the subject of conspiracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special ground 16d assigned error, &quot;because the court erred in enforcing seating arrangements for counsel at counsel table, that constituted an unfair advantage for State's counsel and an unfair disadvantage for movant and his counsel and a denial of due process for movant in violation of his said constitutional right of due process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special ground 31 assigned error on the court's failure to grant a mistrial for allegedly improper remarks made by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  counsel for the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each of the above six grounds, movant alleged the error therein complained of violated stated provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions; the only constitutional provisions referred to in any of these grounds being those relating to due process, freedom of conscience, and religious opinions.  See Code, &sect;&sect; 1-801, 1-815; Code (Ann. Supp.), &sect;&sect; 2-103, 2-112, 2-113.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special ground 4 complained because the judge, upon his own initiative, denied to movant his constitutional right actively to participate with his counsel in the conduct of his own defense by himself conducting the cross-examination of witnesses against him for the State, and particularly the witness, H. C. Newton, a detective of the City of Atlanta; the ruling of the court being that in order to avail himself of such right of cross-examination the movant would have first to dismiss his then counsel definitely from the case and forfeit any and all right to reinstall him as such counsel at any later stage of the case, although he made timely announcement of his intention to cross-examine the said witness and of his request and desire to do so immediately on the conclusion of the said witnesses's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  direct examination by counsel for the State, before any cross-examination of said witness had been undertaken and while said witness remained upon the stand for the purpose of cross-examination.  The movant's request and attempt to exercise his said asserted right to cross-examine the said witness and other witnesses for the State, as supported and urged by himself and his counsel, who consented thereto, and the court's said ruling thereon, were as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorney specifically invoked the provision of the Constitution, that &quot;No person shall be deprived of the right to prosecute or defend his own cause in any of the courts of this State, in person, by attorney, or both.&quot; See Code (Ann. Supp.), &sect; 2-104.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ground of the motion then sets forth a lengthy colloquy, in which the judge, the defendant, and the defendant's attorney, all participated, parts of the colloquy being as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court: &quot;I am going to rule this: Just as long as your father is your counsel and attorney representing you, only he can ask the questions.  If you reach the state you have no counsel and don't desire a counsel appointed for you, I will permit you to conduct your own defense.  If you reach&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that state I am going to give you an opportunity to select counsel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant: &quot;I was the only one present when most of the things that have been related to the jury and the court for the last couple of days occurred, and I am the only one able to know when the truth is being told and when the truth is not being told.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant: &quot;I am the only one in position to know when the witnesses get on or off the truth or when certain points are left out in their cross-examination, in their direct examination, and it is not that I am dissatisfied with counsel, but I have to talk with him and confer with him and half the time he doesn't know what is right and what is not, and it takes up the court's time when he asks about a thing that is wrong, that is not wrong, when it was the truth, and otherwise I have to direct him --.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court: &quot;You have the right to confer with him any time you want to.  He is your counsel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant: &quot;Yes, I understand that, but now what I would like to know is this, if I did, it is a tremendous advantage in talking direct to the witness, now if I did take over the case, Your Honor, and cross-examine this witness from here on, then that means that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  when the arguments come, I must carry on with the arguments?  For instance, if my father does not continue the case for me any longer through the questioning of the witnesses, can I reobtain him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court: &quot;No, sir.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court: &quot;I have ruled this, Mr. Loomis, and I think you as a lawyer know what the law is.  With regard to the defendant representing criminal cases, the defendant has the right to come into court and defend himself.  Where he selects counsel to represent him, the case is tried by counsel, he is represented by counsel, and since he has counsel, the court will only permit counsel for him to ask questions and argue the case.  Now if he hasn't got counsel and doesn't want the court to appoint him a counsel, then he can conduct his own defense, but I am not going to permit a mix-up, start off by your representing him as counsel and then stop and let him step in and represent himself and then permit you to have anything further to do with the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Loomis: &quot;Doesn't Your Honor in that ruling strike out the words, 'or both,' of paragraph four of section one of the Bill of Rights?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court: &quot;No, sir.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Loomis: &quot;May I ask Your Honor as a matter of information&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  what those words are supposed to mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court: &quot;I am not construing the Constitution now.  I am simply passing on the request of your son to be permitted to act as his own counsel, and I am ruling as long as he has you as counsel you will have to represent him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the motion for a new trial, it is contended that the ruling of the court as above stated deprived the defendant of his right to defend his own case in person, by attorney, or both, as declared in the foregoing constitutional provision; and that the exercise by the defendant of his right of cross-examination was indispensable in this particular case (for reasons stated) for the preservation of his rights and liberties unimpaired and unprejudiced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant yet recognized his own limitations, in so far as the other phases of the case were concerned, and was, therefore, unwilling -- if there was in fact no alternative -- to pay the price of dispensing with his counsel in respect to these other matters, even in order to gain the much valued and much desired right of personal cross-examination.  Still other assignments of error were contained in this ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special ground 16a assigned error on a long excerpt from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the court's charge referring to counts 2, 4, and 5 of the indictment, and as to each count instructing the jury that if they believed beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the offense as alleged, they would be authorized to convict him.  Assignments (f) and (g) were as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(f) &quot;Because, as to each and every one of counts two, four, and five of said indictment, said section 26-4902 of the Georgia Code [is] inapplicable, because the same was unconstitutional in that it violated the due-process guaranties of both the Constitution of the State of Georgia [citing], and the Constitution of the United States of America [citing], which respectively read as follows [quoting said provisions] and which were violated by said section 26-4902 in at least two respects, viz.:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. In that the said statute was too vague and indefinite to define the incidence of guilt -- that is, the event or events in which the things therein denounced were prohibited and made punishable -- since it in effect provided that it made the things therein denounced be criminal and forbidden and made the same punishable as therein provided only when they were not otherwise provided for by law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;2. In that said statute was too vague and indefinite in defining the thing therein denounced as criminal and forbidden, and thus failed to provide any reasonable or sufficiently ascertainable standard of guilt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(g) &quot;Because, as to each and every one of counts two, four, and five of said indictment, said section 29-4902 of the Georgia Code was, as construed by the court, inapplicable, because, as so construed by the court, unconstitutional, since the court construed the statute as making punishable the doing of anything by a private citizen, as such, which happens also to be one of the things done by policemen in the performance of their public duties, and not as making punishable such act only when so done by one not a policeman under the claim and pretense that in so doing he was a policeman, and thus construed the statute in such a way as to make it abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, contrary to section I of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States, supra, movant being, according to the uncontradicted proofs, a citizen of the United States and, therefore, entitled to the protection of the said constitutional guaranty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special ground&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  19 assigned error on two excerpts from the judge's charge to the jury, the first of which was as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I charge you that the police of a State, in a comprehensive sense, embraces its system of internal regulation by which it is sought not only to preserve the public order, and to prevent offenses against the State, but also to establish, for the intercourse of citizen with citizen, those rules of good manners and good neighborhood which are calculated to prevent a conflict of rights and to insure to each the uninterrupted enjoyment of his own, so far as is reasonably consistent with a like enjoyment of rights by others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the second excerpt, the jury were instructed that &quot;The word 'police' is the function of that branch of the administrative machinery of the government which is charged with the preservation of public order and tranquility, promotion of public health, safety and morals, and the prevention and punishment of crimes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only assignments of error which undertook to raise any constitutional question in relation to either of these instructions were as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, finally, both portions of the court's charge as quoted and complained of in this ground constitutes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such a construction of the said statute, to wit, section 26-4902 of the Code of the State of Georgia, as renders the same unconstitutional, since, as so construed, the said statute violates the principle of due process as secured and guaranteed by&quot; quoted provisions of the Constitutions of Georgia and the United States.  &quot;The statute offends against said principle of due process and said constitutional guaranties respectively, because it provides no reasonably or sufficiently ascertainable standard of guilt when construed as the court has here construed it in the charge complained of in this ground.  This is the first opportunity movant has had to complain of the court's said erroneous charge and said unconstitutionality of statute as construed therein.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff claimed that the supreme court and not the court of appeals, had jurisdiction over the action even though a violation of Ga.

On review, the court found that the court of appeals had jurisdiction of actions involving mere applications of unquestioned and unambiguous provisions of the Georgia and United States Constitutions. The court found that the trial court's denial of his request to cross-examine a named witness because he was better acquainted with the facts than was his attorney was not error because the trial court had inherent power to prescribe the manner in which it conducted business without depriving him of his right to prosecute or defend his own cause. The court ruled that he could not raise for the first time on appeal the constitutionality of &sect; 26-4902 because it formed the basis of the indictment and he should have anticipated the jury charges which he alleged were in error. The court ruled that no constitutional question was properly raised to bring the action within the court's jurisdiction, and the action was transferred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Georgia General Assembly created a new county from the counties of Ware and Lowndes to be called the Clinch County. Two lots of land that were originally left in Ware County at that time were later, through 1927 Ga. Laws p. 545 (1927 Act), included in Clinch County. On exceptions to the dismissal of its petition to recover the lots, the corporation alleged that the 1927 Act was unconstitutional as being repugnant to constitutional provisions providing that laws of a general nature were to have uniform operation throughout the state. The court noted that no attack on the 1927 Act's validity was made in the trial court, and thus the court was required to assume that it was a valid and constitutional statute, and that, in view of it, the two lots of land were situated in Clinch County instead of Ware. Because cases respecting titles to land were required to be tried in the county where the land lay, the Superior Court of Ware County was without jurisdiction to try any issue respecting title to the lands.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts in case 16047 are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">H. D. Ellis filed a suit in equity against the City of Hapeville and named individuals as the Mayor and Council.  He alleged that the act of the General Assembly approved March 28, 1947 (Ga. L. 1947, p. 1395), purporting to extend the territorial limits of the City of Hapeville, subject to a referendum, is unconstitutional and void, because notice of intention to apply for such legislation was not published once a week for three weeks during the period of sixty days immediately preceding its introduction into the General Assembly, as required by article 3, section 7, paragraph 15 of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to the publication that was made, the petition alleged that notice was published on November 14, November 21, and November 28, 1946, but was not thereafter again published; and that the bill proposing such legislation was not introduced until March 11, 1947, so that there was no publication at all during the period of sixty days immediately preceding its introduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition further alleged: By reason of the facts above stated, the City&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Hapeville and the named governing authorities are without authority to exercise any jurisdiction whatever over the additional territory, as described in the act and also in the petition.  The petitioner is a resident and citizen of said territory, and he brings this action on behalf of himself and other residents of said territory similarly situated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the passage of said act and under the purported authority therein contained, the defendants herein named have sought to assume jurisdiction and assert control over the above described territory, and said defendants are now contending that said territory constitutes a part of the City of Hapeville and is subject to control by said city and subject to all the powers that said city may have the right to exercise over its citizens, and that the citizens of said territory are now citizens of the City of Hapeville and subject to the obligations imposed by law upon the citizens of said city.  Said defendants are without legal authority to exercise dominion or control over said territory or any of the citizens thereof, and said territory is not a part of the City of Hapeville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless said defendants are restrained and enjoined from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  so doing, they will continue to seek to exercise dominion and control over said territory, and endeavor to collect taxes from the residents thereof, to impose license fees upon the persons engaged in business in said territory, and generally to deal with the citizens of said territory as legal residents of said city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioner is without adequate remedy at law in the premises, and is entitled to the protection of a court of equity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherefore, the petitioner prays: (1) that said defendants be restrained and permanently enjoined from in any manner exercising or seeking to exercise dominion, control, or supervision of the territory hereinabove described or any of the residents or citizens thereof, and from in any manner dealing with said territory as a part of the City of Hapeville; (2) for general relief; and (3) for process.  (There was no allegation that the plaintiff owned property in the proposed additional territory or that he was engaged in any business therein.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court sustained a general demurrer and dismissed the petition, and the plaintiff excepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case 16049, the facts were the same, except that in the latter case the petition was brought by a different plaintiff, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  namely, K. B. Irvine.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The citizens alleged that an act to extend the territorial limits of the city was unconstitutional and void because notice of intention to apply for such legislation was not published for the required period. The citizens alleged that the city was seeking to assume jurisdiction and assert control over such territory, and unless restrained and enjoined it would continue to seek to exercise dominion and control over the territory. The court determined that these allegations were not sufficient to show impending injury to person or property of either citizen because it was not shown that either owned property in such territory or that his personal or property rights were affected. Even as to a plaintiff who was a taxpayer, a court of equity would not enjoin an ultra vires act of municipal authorities that could not have injured the taxpayer.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal Land Bank of Columbia filed in the Superior Court of Bacon County, Georgia, a petition against B. H. Aldridge, as tax collector of the said county, and Glenn S. Phillips, as State Revenue Commissioner of the State of Georgia, alleging the following: The petitioner has outstanding a large number of loans in various counties of this State, which are secured by liens on farm lands.  In 1934 it made a loan to G. A. Carter on the security of 206 acres, more or less, of lots of land Nos. 81, 104 and 105 in the fifth land district of Bacon County, and took from him a deed to secure the said loan, the deed being duly recorded, and the loan being still outstanding.  The said Carter failed to pay the county ad valorem tax on the said land for the year 1945, and an execution for such tax and for ad valorem taxes on personal property owned and returned by him was issued by the defendant, B. H. Aldridge, as tax collector, and is outstanding and unsatisfied, constituting a lien against the petitioner's security, and it may be levied at any time on the said security and the security be offered for sale&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to enforce the said execution.  The amount of the ad valorem tax assessed against the petitioner's security is $ 9, and the amount of the ad valorem tax assessed against the said personal property of G. A. Carter, included in the execution aforesaid, is $ 43.06.  The petitioner has offered to pay the tax on its security with interest to date of payment and a release fee of fifty cents.  Such offer was made to B. H. Aldridge, as tax collector of Bacon County, with the understanding that upon payment of the tax it would be his duty to issue a receipt showing such payment and to execute a release of the land from the lien of the execution aforesaid.  The said Aldridge, as tax collector, has refused to accept payment of the tax on the land aforesaid, with interest and the release fee, on the ground that no other real estate is returned and assessed by or against G. A. Carter with the land on which the petitioner holds a lien, and that the petitioner is without legal right to pay the tax on said land and have the same released from the execution without also paying the tax on the personal property returned by G. A. Carter and included in the execution; the said Aldridge, as tax collector, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  asserting that he is acting under the authority and direction of the State Revenue Commissioner who, acting through his agent, B. E. Thrasher, Chief Clerk of the Property and License Tax Unit of the Department of Revenue, has advised him, in substance, that he can refuse to issue a release under the offer as made by the petitioner.  The petitioner is advised and believes that it has a legal right to pay the tax on its security and have it released from the execution without also paying the tax on the personal property, and its effort to do so and the refusal of B. H. Aldridge, as tax collector, to accept the payment offered and to release the land from the execution constitute an actual controversy as to which the petitioner is entitled to a declaratory judgment by the court.  The controversy involves uncertainty and insecurity with respect to the rights of the petitioner arising out of a large number of its loans in various counties of this State.  The prayers were: (1) For process; (2) that the court render judgment declaring that the petitioner has a right to pay the tax on the land hereinbefore referred to, without paying the tax on the personal property, and to have the land released&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from the lien of the tax execution issued against G. A. Carter, leaving it as a lien only against his personal property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants each filed demurrers on the following grounds: (1) no cause of action is set forth against the defendant; (2) the petition does not set forth an actual controversy entitling the petitioner to a declaratory judgment; (3) the petition does not set forth a cause of action for equitable relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants also filed answers, which as amended denied that the petitioner was entitled to the relief sought, and contending that the Code, &sect; 92-5712, upon which the petitioner relied was unconstitutional, in that it violated article 7, section 1, paragraph 1 of the Constitution (Code, Ann. Supp., &sect; 2-5401), and the provisions of the Constitution as appearing in the Code, &sect; 2-2401, before the 1945 amendment to the Constitution, being the same as the provisions of article 7, section 1, paragraph 1, supra, for the reason that, where a tax execution for ad valorem taxes covers only one piece, parcel, or tract of real estate, and it is shown that a release executed by the tax collector would seriously impair or extinguish the lien for taxes, it restrains the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sovereign right of the State to tax as declared by the Constitution.  They prayed that it be declared by the court that the tax collector did not have the right to release the real estate as sought by the petitioner; that the act of 1931 (Ga. L. 1931, p. 122) as amended by the act of 1933 (Ga. L. 1933, p. 50), codified as &sect; 92-5712, has no application when a tax execution covers only one piece, parcel, or tract of real estate; and that the said act of 1931 as amended (Code, &sect; 92-5712) be declared unconstitutional if applied to a release as sought by the petitioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the case came on for a hearing, the defendants, on October 4, 1947, admitted that the allegations of fact in the petition were true; and it was agreed between the parties that the judge of the court hear and determine all issues in vacation without a jury.  On October 11, 1947, the court rendered judgment overruling the demurrers, and declaring that the petitioner was entitled to the relief sought, the judgment being based &quot;on the stipulation and finding that G. A. Carter returns no real estate in Bacon County other than the land covered by the plaintiff's deed to secure debt, and that no other land in Bacon County&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is assessed as the property of G.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The tax authorities argued that the interpretation of Ga.

In support of this view the authorities urged that where, as here, a tax execution covered only one piece, parcel, or tract of real estate, and it was shown that a release thereof by the tax authorities could seriously impair or extinguish the lien for taxes, the sovereign right of the state to tax as declared by the constitution was restrained. The court found that Ga.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certiorari; from Court of Appeals.  75 Ga. App. 211.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present case is before this court on certiorari from the Court of Appeals.  For the decision under review, see 75 Ga. App. 211 (42 S. E. 2d, 781). The action in the trial court was a proceeding by a New York corporation to revive a dormant judgment.  By an amendment, it appeared that the plaintiff was suing for the use of another corporation, to which the cause of action was assigned pending the original suit in which the judgment was obtained.  The amendment further disclosed that the corporation was voluntarily dissolved after institution of the proceeding for revival; whereupon the trial court sustained a demurrer and dismissed the action.  The main question in the case is whether the action abated on dissolution of the plaintiff, as a corporate entity, and involves a determination as to whether section 36 of the Corporation Act of 1938, providing for continued existence of &quot;all corporations&quot; for the term of three years after their dissolution and until final disposition of all suits begun within that time, for the purpose of prosecuting and defending suits by or against them, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and other purposes, applies to foreign corporations.  The Court of Appeals held that these provisions apply alike to foreign and domestic corporations, and reversed the judgment of the trial court.  The petition as amended did not show whether the corporation had ever been engaged in business in Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts of the case, as stated in detail by the Court of Appeals, were as follows: On May 22, 1945, The Mortgage-Bond Company of New York filed a petition for scire facias to revive a judgment obtained by it on January 7, 1936, in Fulton Superior Court against W. H. Wynne, States Realty Company Inc., and Wynndam Court Apartment Company Inc.  It was alleged that said judgment was more than seven years old and was dormant, and that no part of the debt for which said judgment was rendered had been paid except $ 1000, realized from the sale of certain property levied on and sold in February, 1936, under the fi. fa. issued on said judgment, which amount had been credited thereon.  It was alleged that W. H. Wynne had died testate after the rendition of the judgment and the issuance of the fi. fa., and under his will, which had been probated, Trust Company of Georgia was named as executor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and trustee and had qualified as such more than 12 months before the filing of the petition.  The petition prayed that scire facias issue and be served upon Trust Company of Georgia, as executor and trustee of the said W. H. Wynne; that it be required to show cause why it should not be made a party defendant in the case; that service likewise be made upon the other defendants; and that all of the defendants be required to show cause why said judgment should not be revived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In amendments to the petition for scire facias, it was alleged that The Mortgage-Bond Company, the original plaintiff, had sold, conveyed, transferred, assigned, and delivered on October 21, 1935, to Mortbon Corporation of New York all of its assets and property (except its corporation franchise and name), with all &quot;privileges and appurtenances whatsoever thereunto belonging,&quot; subject to certain conditions not material to this case; that under said assignment the notes evidencing the indebtedness on which said original judgment was issued became the property of Mortbon Corporation; and that after the date of said assignment the latter corporation had exclusive custody and control over said notes, and upon the rendition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of said judgment said corporation assumed exclusive custody and control over said judgment and the execution issued thereon.  It was also alleged in the amendments that, notwithstanding said transfer and assignment, which was made after the filing of the original petition in the suit on the notes and before the judgment was obtained therein, Mortbon Corporation allowed and permitted the case to proceed in the name of the assignor, and allowed and permitted the judgment to be taken in the name of said assignor, but that said corporation was the owner and holder for a valuable consideration of the notes on which the judgment was obtained and the indebtedness represented by them, after October 21, 1935 (the date of the assignment), and was the beneficial and equitable owner and holder of the judgment and the execution issued thereon at all times after the judgment was rendered and the execution was issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears from the petition that it was in fact filed by Mortbon Corporation, although it was filed in the name of The Mortgage-Bond Company; and that on June 30, 1945, after the filing of the petition, the name of Mortbon Corporation was changed to Telfair Stockton &amp; Company Inc., &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the petition prayed that the action proceed in the name of the plaintiff for the use of Telfair Stockton &amp; Company Inc.  It also appears that on June 4, 1945, while the petition for scire facias to revive said dormant judgment was pending, the charter of the plaintiff, The Mortgage-Bond Company, was dissolved under a voluntary proceeding in the Supreme Court of the State of New York.  It was then alleged that, &quot;notwithstanding the dissolution of said charter, the present owner and holder of the beneficial and equitable interest in said dormant judgment, to wit, Telfair Stockton &amp; Company Inc., is under the laws of the State of Georgia and equitable principles, entitled to have said case proceed in the name of The Mortgage-Bond Company of New York, and is, under said laws and equitable principles, entitled to have said dormant judgment revived and to have the same enforced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of the defendants filed demurrers to the petition as amended as follows: (1) Said petition does not as a whole, nor do any of its parts, show a cause of action against this defendant for the revival of the judgment sought to be revived in said petition.  (2) Said petition as amended shows on its face that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the party plaintiff has no legal existence.  The demurrers were sustained by the trial court, and the plaintiff, The Mortgage-Bond Company of New York, suing for the use of Telfair Stockton &amp; Company Inc., excepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals having reversed the judgment of the trial court sustaining the demurrers and dismissing the petition, the defendants in error in the Court of Appeals, namely, Trust Company of Georgia, as executor and trustee under the will of W. H. Wynne, deceased, States Realty Company Inc., and Wynndam Court Apartment Company Inc., presented to this court an application for the writ of certiorari, which application was granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the motion for rehearing in the Court of Appeals, the movants, now petitioners in certiorari, averred, among other things, that the court &quot;overlooked the fact that it does not appear in the record that at the time of its dissolution, or at any other time, The Mortgage-Bond and Trust Company [?] was engaged in business in the State of Georgia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition for certiorari assigned error on the decision and judgment of the Court of Appeals upon the ground, among others, that they were illegal and contrary to law, because the court incorrectly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  held that section 36 applies to foreign as well as Georgia corporations.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff New York corporation sought to revive a dormant judgment that was obtained from a different corporation which had dissolved. The trial court dismissed the action. That dismissal was reversed on plaintiff's appeal to the Court of Appeals (Georgia). Defendants, realty company and apartment company, appealed the dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation brought an action in the trial court to revive a dormant judgment. It was discovered that, in reality, the corporation was not the original corporation which held the judgment that was to be revived. The original corporation had assigned its rights to the corporation and had since dissolved. Defendants, realty company and apartment company, obtained dismissal of the action, the corporation appealed, and that dismissal was reversed. This appeal ensued. The court determined that the main question was whether the action had abated on dissolution of the original corporation as a corporate entity and whether &sect; 36 of the Corporation Act of 1938 applied to foreign corporations. Under &sect; 36, Georgia corporations continued in existence for three years after dissolution in order to prosecute or defend actions. The court found &sect; 36 did not apply to foreign corporations. This meant the original corporation, who was a foreign corporation, did not continue in existence after its dissolution, especially since it did not conduct any business in the state. Moreover, the original action abated because the revival was not brought by the original corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court that reversed a dismissal by the trial court of the corporation's action to revive a dormant judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Petition for injunction.  Before Judge Guess.  DeKalb Superior Court.  July 2, 1947.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker Electrical Company filed its verified petition in DeKalb Superior Court, alleging: H. G. Walton, the defendant, is a resident of DeKalb County.  Walton has filed three cases against the plaintiff in the Civil Court of Fulton County.  The issues in the three cases should be determined in one action; they constitute a single controversy.  Walton divided his demands to prevent the plaintiff from setting forth its defense.  (See Walker Electrical Co. v. Walton, 201 Ga. 591, 40 S. E. 2d, 523, for a statement of Walton's three suits.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contracts between the plaintiff and Walton involve work for the United States Government.  Walton failed and refused to file certain termination claims, and the amounts claimed by Walton in his first suit are proper items of a termination claim.  The defendant persisted in his refusal to file a termination claim until a stipulation was made that by so doing the defendant would not waive his right to prosecute his action and would not be bound by the termination claim.  An award has been made on the termination claim, in a stated sum, and the plaintiff has offered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to turn this over to the defendant in settlement of the three suits, but it has been refused.  Walton's trover action involves certain machinery which is either the property of the United States or of the plaintiff, the cost of the machinery having been paid to the defendant in amounts paid him by the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three cases filed by Walton involve construction contracts on the premises of the plaintiff, and construction contracts for Owens and Blum, executives of the plaintiff, the amount claimed by the defendant in the third case being the result of an audit made by auditors and the attorney for the defendant.  The amount found due by such audit did not take into account counter-claims of the plaintiff which had not been put on the books of the plaintiff because they were unliquidated in amount.  The defendant failed to keep records separating the material and labor chargeable to the plaintiff and that chargeable to named executives of the plaintiff, for which the plaintiff would be reimbursed by such executives.  Numerous items and demands of the plaintiff against the defendant are set out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to avoid a multiplicity of actions, the issues should be consolidated, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the plaintiff's petition should be maintained for the purpose of an accounting.  It is alleged &quot;on information and belief that the defendant is insolvent.&quot; The plaintiff can not obtain full and adequate relief in the Civil Court of Fulton County because it is a court of limited jurisdiction and has no equitable jurisdiction, may not appoint an auditor, and does not have jurisdiction to make an accounting between the parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The act approved January 31, 1946 (Ga. L. 1946, pp. 287-294), increasing the jurisdiction of the Civil Court of Fulton County, is void and of no effect for certain stated reasons.  (Constitutional attacks made by the petition of the plaintiff in error, and urged by counsel in its behalf, will be discussed in the opinion.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayers of the original petition were that: the bill be filed; process issue; temporary injunction be granted; an order be entered consolidating the issues involved in the three cases pending in the Civil Court of Fulton County; the case be referred to an auditor; and the plaintiff have judgment against the defendant in a stated sum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff filed two amendments to the petition.  In the first, a further attack was made on the act&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  increasing the jurisdiction of the Civil Court of Fulton County.  By the second amendment, additional matters were set up to show that the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant, it being alleged that the accounts between the parties are numerous and payrolls on various jobs must be compared, that it is impossible for a jury to pass upon the complicated facts, and that the plaintiff is entitled to discovery from the defendant of the names and addresses of employees to whom he claims he made payment of wages, and the time and place where they were employed.  The plaintiff prayed that an order issue directing the defendant to make the records described available to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general demurrer to the petition was sustained and the case dismissed.  The exception is to that judgment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant brought one action based on termination claims, one in trover, and one to recover under an audit. Plaintiff claimed that the actions should be consolidated because they constituted a single controversy and because it could not obtain adequate relief due to the civil court's limited jurisdiction. The court found that 1946 Ga. Laws 287 gave the civil court concurrent jurisdiction with the superior courts, did not contain any restriction as to cases pending on its effective date, and gave sufficient publication of notice as required by Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; 7, par. 15 (1945). Thus, the court held that the civil court had full jurisdiction to determine all issues between the parties in the pending cases, including any defenses filed or amended by plaintiff. The court also held that under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 3-113, defendant's claims could not be joined in the same action because two arose ex contractu and one ex delicto. Furthermore, the petition did not make a cause for consolidation of actions in equity because there was no showing that the multiplicity of suits would render a trial difficult, expensive, and unsatisfactory at law.</SPAN></P>

Entering a pharmacy with a black plastic bag over his hand and telling the victim he had a gun was sufficient to establish the use of an offensive weapon, even though the victim did not see an actual gun and no gun was recovered. The evidence was sufficient to support the false imprisonment conviction where the victim testified that appellant forced him at gunpoint to sit on the floor of the pharmacy and remain there. Application of the recidivist statute,&nbsp;Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-7, did not violate the Separation of Powers doctrine, Ga. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff wife appealed a judgment of the Effingham Superior Court (Georgia) granting summary judgment to defendant husband on the ground of interspousal tort immunity. Defendant employer cross-appealed the same court's denial of its summary judgment motion on plaintiff's claims of respondeat superior, negligent entrustment, and negligent hiring and retention of defendant husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant husband was driving plaintiff wife and the rest of his family home from dinner in a truck owned by defendant employer when the truck was involved in an accident. Defendant husband had consumed several beers earlier in the day and had two margaritas at dinner. Plaintiff was seriously injured. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendant husband and denied summary judgment to defendant employer. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in part, holding that the interspousal tort immunity doctrine prohibited plaintiff from suing defendant husband for personal injuries. The court reversed the judgment in part, holding that defendant employer was not liable to plaintiff because defendant husband was not acting within the course and scope of his employment at the time of the accident. Defendant husband was not on call, and defendant employer had no actual knowledge that defendant husband was drinking and driving the evening of the collision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was affirmed as to defendant husband. The interspousal tort immunity doctrine precluded plaintiff wife from bringing a personal injury suit against defendant husband. The judgment was reversed as to defendant employer, because defendant husband was not acting within the scope of his employment when he wrecked defendant employer's truck.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant failed to maintain funds from pre-need funeral service contracts unimpaired in an authorized state bank as required under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 43-18-96. Accordingly, defendant was charged with unlawful disposition of proceeds received from pre-need funeral service contracts in separate indictments in two different counties. Defendant moved to dismiss the indictments, contending the statute under which he was charged was unconstitutional. Both county Superior Courts denied the motions. Defendant appealed to Georgia's Supreme Court, which transferred the cases to the Court of Appeals, after finding that its subject matter jurisdiction had not been invoked. The appeals court held that it was without jurisdiction to consider the merits of the direct appeals because the denial of the motions were not directly appealable under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 5-6-34(a)(1), but were only appealable as interlocutory orders or after a conviction. Therefore, although defendant obtained certificates of immediate review from Superior Court, he did not pursue mandatory application procedures of &sect; 5-6-34(b) for interlocutory appeals. Thus, court was without jurisdiction, and appeals were dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's appeal was dismissed because the denial of his motions to dismiss the indictments filed against him were not directly appealable, but, instead, were appealable only as interlocutory orders. Thus, the court lacked jurisdiction to review the direct appeals because defendant did not pursue the mandatory application procedures associated with interlocutory appeals and required for the court to review interlocutory appeals.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court concluded that defendant, owner of a race track, was guilty of theft of services in issuing checks to winning drivers despite knowledge that there were insufficient funds in the business account to cover the checks, especially where drivers had voiced concerns about the sufficiency of funds and defendant assured them that the race track was solvent. Such evidence showed intent, and supported the verdict. Further, defendant committed the offense of theft by taking when he accepted race fuel and paid by check, but later stopped payment thereon. Defendant made no attempt to make payment or to return the fuel, which he had sold to drivers for profit.</SPAN></P>

The search revealed cash, marijuana, and methamphetamine. Appellant was found guilty of possession of less than one ounce of marijuana, possession of methamphetamine, and related offenses.

Appellant argued that the court erred when it denied his motion to suppress because the state failed to prove that the radar was used in accordance with law, because he was illegally detained and his vehicle was searched without proper consent, and because the evidence obtained from a diaper bag belonged to his passenger. The court affirmed. It found that the denial of the motion to suppress was proper even if the radar was not used correctly because the officer could visually detect that the appellant was speeding and was therefore authorized to make the stop. In addition, the court found that consent to the search was freely given.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A jury found defendant guilty of rape, aggravated sodomy, and sodomy. The trial court merged the aggravated sodomy and sodomy counts and entered judgment on the rape and aggravated sodomy counts. Defendant moved to vacate the convictions on the sodomy and aggravated sodomy charges asserting that the convictions were void under a new supreme court ruling. The trial court denied the motion and defendant appealed. The reviewing court stated that a trial court could resentence a defendant at any time if a sentence was void. The court stated the new ruling applied to simple sodomy. Thus, the ruling did not render defendant's conviction for aggravated sodomy void and the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to vacate the conviction. Although the jury had found defendant guilty of simple sodomy, the sodomy charge had been merged with the aggravated sodomy conviction. Thus, the only crimes that defendant was convicted of were rape and aggravated sodomy. Defendant's motion to vacate was denied. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of rape and aggravated sodomy. Defendant's sodomy charge had been merged with the aggravated sodomy charge. Therefore, the new supreme court ruling did not apply to defendant because the ruling only applied to sodomy, not aggravated sodomy.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 43-21-16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Holding that as a person who had contracted to use hotel rooms, plaintiff tour operator had standing to sue defendant hotel under the Olympic Anti-Price Gouging Statute,&nbsp;Ga. Code &sect; 43-21-16. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment for defendant, and vacated the judgment allowing defendant to keep plaintiff's deposit as a liquidated damage. Under the plain language of the statute, plaintiff had standing to sue, because a person who contracted to use a hotel room was not limited to the ultimate consumer or occupier of the room. The court held that the trial court's emphasis on the fact that plaintiff met the statute's definition of a hotel operator, and did not meet the definition of a guest, was misplaced. The court held that nothing in the statute indicated that it protected only guests or excluded operators from protection. The court defined &quot;to use&quot; as to put into service or to have recourse to, or enjoyment of. The court also noted that the contract explicitly provided plaintiff with the right to occupy the rooms. Because the court found that plaintiff had standing, it vacated the trial court's ruling that defendant could keep plaintiff's security deposit.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion and amended motion for a new trial. Defendant appealed, claiming that her right to be present at trial and to confront witnesses was violated when portions of the trial were conducted in her absence. She also claimed that the trial court erred in admitting evidence that the county previously had investigated her when bruising was noticed on her son. The court affirmed the conviction, explaining that defendant voluntarily absented herself during trial because she was free on bail, knew the proceedings had begun, and failed to attend. Further, her voluntary absence waived her right to be present when her sentence was imposed. The court further determined that defendant did not challenge the purpose for which the subject evidence was admitted at trial and therefore could not raise the issue on appeal. Finally, although defendant arguably failed to preserve the issue for appeal, the court determined that erroneous admission of a child's hearsay statements did not require reversal because the statements were merely cumulative of other evidence.</SPAN></P>

Shortly before trial was scheduled to begin, defendant attempted suicide by taking an overdose of pills. The trial court found defendant fit to stand trial a day later and denied a continuance. Videotaped testimony from a social worker was admitted because she would be considerably inconvenienced if required to remain another day. Witnesses testified that defendant had engaged in other inappropriate behavior with children. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction because he was not entitled to a continuance where the trial court reasonably determined that he was sufficiently recovered to stand trial. Defendant waived any right under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 24-10-130(e) to object to the admission of the videotaped testimony because his own conduct in delaying the trial caused the situation. Evidence of similar behavior was admissible in cases involving sexual abuse of children. Denial of a mistrial was not error where a curative instruction was given promptly.

At trial, certificates of drug analysis issued pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 35-3-16 (b), subsequently found to be unconstitutional, were admitted to show that the substance was cocaine. On appeal, the court found that reversal was not required. Since defendant did not object at or before trial to admission of the certificates and did not timely object on constitutional grounds, he waived review. The certificates were properly admitted under the statute in effect at the time, and that evidence, coupled with the officers' testimony, was sufficient to support the conviction. Defendant did not prove that his counsel was ineffective by failing to object to admission of the certificates and failing to tell him that plaintiff state intended to use his prior crimes to aggravate his sentence. The certificates were properly admitted, and plaintiff did not offer a plea to reduce his possible sentence; therefore, defendant could not show a reasonable probability that the outcome of his case would have been different.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with armed robbery and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. During opening argument, the prosecutor commented on defendant's decision to present a case and present evidence to the jury. Defendant moved for a mistrial, and the motion was denied. Defendant was convicted of both charges, and he appealed. The appeals court affirmed the convictions because, considering the indirect nature of the prosecutor's comment and that fact that it was given during the opening statement, the court concluded that there was no manifest intent by prosecutor to comment on defendant's failure to testify and that jury would not necessarily understand statement as a comment on defendant's failure to testify; thus, court did not err in refusing to grant a mistrial. Moreover, failure to instruct jury regarding lesser-included offense of robbery was not an error because evidence did not support a charge on robbery just because the gun defendant used when committing the crime was not loaded. Finally, defendant's contention that sentencing requirements of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-7 were unconstitutional had been, in another case, previously settled adversely to him.</SPAN></P>

In reversing the decision, the court overruled the decision in Division 2 of State v Stamey, 211 Ga. App. 837, 440 S.E.2nd 725, (1994) and held that an allegation that the amount taken was in excess of $ 500 or under $ 500 was sufficient to apprise the defendant that he was facing either a misdemeanor or a felony charge.

The jury awarded compensatory damages and punitive damages. Defendant appealed, contending that an adjuster's failure to forward the copies of the complaints to headquarters and retain counsel was excusable because she was not an attorney and should not be held to the same standard as an attorney.

The court also rejected appellant's argument that &sect; 19-7-3 was unconstitutional when appellant asserted a new basis for this argument for the first time in her motion for a new trial. The court also rejected appellant's argument that the trial court erred in considering the best interests of the child without first making a determination that appellant was an unfit parent because &sect; 19-7-3 did not required that finding.

In the civil action, the trial court found that plaintiff's complaint was frivolous and dismissed the suit. Subsequently, the trial court ordered that future pleadings filed by plaintiff were to be deemed null and void by operation of law. Upon plaintiff's appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of plaintiff's civil action holding that res judicata, under Ga.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, 17 non-profit fraternal organizations located within the boundaries of a university, appealed a judgment from the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), which affirmed summary judgment in favor of defendant county and rejected the organizations' equal protection challenge to their motion for summary judgment. The organizations brought suit seeking property tax exemptions and tax refunds under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-5-41(a)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The organizations contended that &sect; 48-5-41(a)(6) was unconstitutional as applied because some university fraternities and sororities which used their properties in an identical manner received tax exemptions, which resulted in disparate treatment violative of equal protection. The court affirmed and held that the other organizations that received tax exemptions were not similarly situated because they, unlike the 17 organizations in dispute, were located on real property belonging to the university. Because the university was a &quot;college,&quot; its property fit squarely within the express language of &sect; 48-5-41(a)(6). On the other hand, the 17 organizations were not operating on &quot;college&quot; property, but on private land located within the boundaries of the university. The organizations' &quot;identical use&quot; argument overlooked the crucial fact that the use had to be by the university or an arm and extension of the university. Because the organizations' buildings were not erected for and used as a college, and because the organizations were not an &quot;arm or extension&quot; of the university, they were foreclosed from claiming otherwise.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that, contrary to defendant's contentions, a DUI suspect may be required to produce a breath sample under Georgia law. However, the appellate court determined defendant should have been permitted to obtain a requested second, state-administered breath test. The appellate court reasoned that under the plain language of Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-6-392(a)(3), 40-5-67.1(b)(2), a DUI defendant--at his own expense--could affirmatively choose to have the state's qualified testing officer perform an additional breath test. Since, as a practical matter, state law enforcement agencies appeared to be the primary locations at which breath test machines were readily available, a timely second breath test could be conducted on a law enforcement agency's machine. Further, the appellate court advised that the State had the burden of demonstrating compliance with the statutory requirements.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant worked at a resort with the victim, a 15-year old boy. The evidence showed that defendant asked the victim about his sexuality, dropped his pants in front of the victim, and asked the victim to do the same. Defendant argued that the State failed to prove his knowledge of the victim's age and erroneously refused to give his requested charge on mistake of fact. The court held that, because a mistaken belief as to the victim's age would not have justified the act, a charge on mistake was not warranted. A directed verdict on the enticement charge did not warrant a directed verdict on the child molestation charge because the two were distinct and separate offenses which were not included within each other as a matter of law. Thus, collateral estoppel, res judicata, and double jeopardy did not apply. The child molestation statute,&nbsp;Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-6-4(a), was neither impermissibly vague nor violative of due process. The State was not required to prove that defendant knew the victim was under the age of 16.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied his motion for new trial, and he appealed. He asserted that the trial court erred in excluding testimony from an expert witness regarding voluntary intoxication in support of the lack of intent defense, in refusing to instruct the jury as to good character, and in sentencing. The court affirmed. It held that defendant failed to show that an alteration of his brain function caused by intoxication was more than temporary. The clinical signs described by the expert were the same as those of any individual who had consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication and did not have permanent brain damage. The doctor's opinion based on a limited examination would have been speculative and was properly excluded. The trial court's failure to charge on good character was not reversible error, given the overwhelming evidence against defendant. Consecutive sentences were permitted where separate and distinct crimes were charged.  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-10.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal from his criminal convictions, defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to sever the trials of the charges relating to two separate incidents, in refusing to grant a mistrial after his character was improperly placed into evidence, and in failing to grant him a directed verdict as to certain offenses. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court's judgment which convicted defendant of aggravated assault on a peace officer, armed robbery, escape, burglary, theft by taking a motor vehicle, use of a firearm by a convicted felon, and multiple counts of kidnapping and false imprisonment. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for severance because evidence regarding the offenses committed on each date would have been admissible in a separate trial on the offenses committed on the other date. Evidence of defendant's motive was admissible even if it incidentally put his character into evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant corporation challenged an order of the DeKalb Superior Court (Georgia), which entered summary judgment in favor of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (department), in a declaratory judgment action brought by the corporation in its attempt to obtain a solid waste handling permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation filed an application for a solid waste handling permit and a request for site suitability for a municipal solid waste landfill. The department denied the application, stating that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 12-8-25.4 prevented issuance of the permit for proposed landfill expansion, because the site would encompass a circular area having a two-mile radius and already containing all or portions of three or more landfills. The corporation did not exhaust its administrative remedies regarding this decision. Instead, the corporation filed a petition for declaratory judgment and injunctive or other relief against the department. The petition averred that &sect; 12-8-25.4 was unconstitutional both facially and as applied, and sought an order declaring the statute unconstitutional and enjoining enforcement of the statute as to the corporation's planned modifications and expansions of the landfill. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the department. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that by electing not to exhaust administrative remedies, the corporation was no longer entitled to petition either for an administrative hearing or for judicial review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was observed weaving across the center road line and driving slowly in her car by a police officer and was stopped because it raised the officer's articulable suspicion that defendant could have been impaired. The officer requested that defendant undergo field sobriety tests. The officer performed a horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test and noted six positive indications of alcohol impairment. After other tests were performed, the officer arrested defendant and read her the Georgia implied consent notice. Defendant was subsequently unable to perform a test at the police station and then refused to submit to the test. At a motion to suppress hearing, the trial court held that any field sobriety test after the HGN test was inadmissible. The court reversed and held that the trial court was in error in its conclusion that Miranda warnings should have been given before the field sobriety tests were conducted because there was no arrest of defendant during the temporary investigatory stop to conduct the field sobriety tests and defendant was not deemed in custody, seized, or &quot;under arrest&quot; for Miranda purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the trial court's determination that certain test results were to be suppressed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of sodomy and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Defendant argued the evidence varied from the indictment and that the court improperly increased his punishment by imposing the registration requirements of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 42-1-12. The court determined defendant was sufficiently informed to defend the sodomy charge proved. The court concluded that proof that defendant submitted to rather than performed the sexual act was sufficient to sustain the conviction. Defendant contended that requiring him to comply with sexual offender registration requirements violated the ex post facto clauses of the Georgia and United States Constitution. The court determined that registration, as a sexual offender was not part of defendant's sentence. The trial court simply informed defendant that upon his probation he might be required to register as a sexual offender. The court stated because it was not part of his sentence there could be no error. The state conceded the trial court erred in sentencing defendant to a 12-month term of imprisonment. The court affirmed the conviction and remanded the case for resentencing on count two of defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

However, the county denied his application for an additional building permit. The landowner filed his petition for a writ of mandamus.

The DeKalb County Superior Court (Georgia), dismissed the claims against the employees and subsequently dismissed the entire action. The former employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The former employee sought damages under the Georgia Tort Claims Act, Ga.

Code Ann. &sect; 50-18-70 et seq., an investigatory report that he had sexually harassed a co-worker while employed by the Board. On appeal, the court held that dismissal was proper because the public had a legitimate interest in a public employee's alleged improper activities in the workplace that outweighed the former employee's interest in non-disclosure. The report was a public record within the meaning of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 50-18-70, and there was no evidence that the report was protected by a court order under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 50-18-70(a). Dismissal of the invasion of privacy claim under the Georgia Tort Claims Act was proper because the Board was required under the Public Records Act to release the information. The trial court did not err in dismissing the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim because the former employee was not deprived of any right or privilege secured by the U.S. Constitution or federal law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, patient and patient's husband, challenged the decision of the Clayton State Court (Georgia), which dismissed their medical malpractice complaint against defendants, doctor and medical group, for failure to attach a properly notarized expert affidavit. Plaintiffs had attached to their complaint the expert affidavit of a doctor, which was signed in Michigan, although a Georgia notary had notarized it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In response to defendants' motion to dismiss, plaintiffs submitted the affidavit of the notary. The notary testified that he had forwarded the affidavit to the expert in Michigan, spoke with the expert by telephone, reviewed the affidavit with him, and had the expert swear to the truth of its contents. The affidavit was notarized on the date that the expert signed it. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order dismissing plaintiffs' case. The court held that in order to make an affidavit, there must be present the officer, the affiant, and the paper, and there must be something done that amounted to the administration of an oath. There must be some solemnity, not mere telephone talk. Long-distance swearing was not permissible. Thus, in the absence of a valid jurat, the expert's affidavit had no validity. Plaintiffs' constitutional argument was not properly before the court for review, because the constitutional argument was to be addressed by the state supreme court, which had not found a reason to do so, and had transferred the appeal to the court.</SPAN></P>

Less than one year later, the parents voluntarily surrendered their parental rights after an unrelated couple filed a petition to adopt the children. The grandparents' motion to intervene was denied and the couple's petition to adopt the grandchildren was granted. On appeal, the court considered whether Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 19-7-1 (b.1) allowed the grandparents to intervene as of right. The court examined the statute in light of other state laws about grandparent rights and concluded that grandparents could object to an adoption when a child had no legal living parent, or when the parent had lost parental rights and the adoption petition had been filed by one of the child's blood relatives. Section 19-7-1(b.1) addressed only how parental power could be lost; it did not create a new right to intervene in an adoption proceeding. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, while incarcerated for other crimes, was indicted for armed robbery.

Subsequently, defendant requested the superior court to arrange for the sheriff to serve various subpoenas, and he filed a motion to suppress evidence of similar transactions. The superior court denied the request to have the subpoenas served and denied the motion to suppress. The superior court ruled that the anticipated testimony was not material to defendant's case and that the prosecution would call the witnesses anyway; no subpoenas were thus necessary. Thereafter, defendant was convicted of armed robbery. Defendant appealed. On review, the court affirmed the judgment. In regard to the evidence of the similar transactions, the court found neither error nor infirmity, which could possibly have deprived defendant of a fair trial. The court noted that such evidence was offered for the proper purpose of showing intent, common scheme and plan, and motive.

His driver's license was suspended for one year after he was arrested for DUI and a subsequent breath test indicated he had an alcohol concentration of .10 or above.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In order to reinstate his driving privileges, appellant submitted proof of completion of a risk reduction program and paid the $ 200 restoration fee. On appeal from the denial of his plea in bar, he claimed that the restoration fee was punishment for the same conduct for which he was being criminally prosecuted. The court affirmed the order denying relief, holding that the fee was not punitive because it was not a fine and was not required to be paid, but was rather a voluntary payment. Neither a driver's license suspension hearing nor the actual suspension of a driver's license constituted a bar to criminal prosecution for DUI. Suspension of a driver's license was the revocation of a privilege voluntarily granted, a traditional attribute of a remedial action. The State had the authority to revoke appellant's driving privileges as a remedial measure, without implication of his Fifth Amendment rights. Therefore, according to the court, the State could revoke appellant's privileges subject to his ability to reinstate them upon certain conditions. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying appellant's plea in bar based upon double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the trial court's order of commitment failed to include written findings on the needs and best interests of the juvenile. The omission was particularly troubling in light of the trial court's comments regarding the punitive nature of the designated felony statute.

Appellant brought suit for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief asserting the unconstitutionality of the Georgia intangible tax, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-6-20 et seq. after appellant was assessed an intangible tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">While suit was pending, the intangible tax assessment at issue was paid, without the prior consent of the appellant or of the trial court, by a person who was not a party to the litigation. Thus, the payment of the taxes was made, by a third party interloper. After payment of the taxes by the interloper, the trial court held that the appellant's suit was moot and the motion to dismiss was granted. The court considered as a matter of first impression whether it violated the public policy of this state for a third party, who was not a party to a lawsuit, to pay the taxes of a party plaintiff without the prior consent of either the trial court or the party plaintiff, thereby causing the plaintiff's case to become moot. The court concluded that it violated the public policy of the state to allow a case to be mooted by the intervention of a third-party who was not a party to the litigation, under the circumstances attendant in this particular case. Accordingly, a legitimate exception existed to the usual rules of mootness under these existing circumstances, and the suit was not rendered moot by the payment of the tax assessment by the third party.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of a misdemeanor for possession of marijuana. Defendant claimed that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the crime charged, and that it erred in denying his motion to suppress the marijuana seized during a late-night security check of his business. On appeal, the court disagreed, and affirmed his conviction. The court rejected the argument that he was actually charged with a felony, over which the trial court had no jurisdiction. The court did not find anything in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-30(j), which conferred misdemeanor status on first offenders, to apply only where a court actually considered and denied defendant a conditional discharge. Next, the court found the trial court had properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. The court held that the police officers who were conducting a routine, nighttime investigation of the business on their patrol could enter the unlocked commercial premises to check for intruders. Finally, the court concluded that once they entered the building and observed the marijuana smoking device in plain view, they had probable cause to seize the device and search for additional contraband.</SPAN></P>

Defendant plead guilty to eavesdropping. After defendant repeatedly violated his probation by continuing to contact her, sometimes from jail, he was convicted of aggravated stalking. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the evidence showed that defendant committed unconsented-to contact with the victim for the purpose of harassing and intimidating her in violation of a condition of probation, which was an offense under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-5-91(a). The court found that &sect; 16-5-91(a) did not violate due process or the First Amendment, and that a pro se defendant was not entitled to bail or a personal computer in jail in order to prepare for trial. If the noisy jail conditions violated defendant's right to representation, the error was harmless because of the overwhelming evidence against him.

The boy molested the foster parents' granddaughter and another child.

The trial court dismissed their action. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision and held that the caseworker's failure to tell the foster parents about the boy's sexual misbehavior was not objectively unreasonable so as to deprive the caseworker of qualified immunity. The department was not aware of any prior sexual molestation of or by the boy, and there was no showing of deliberate indifference by the department that was required to sustain a &sect; 1983 claim. Thus, summary judgment to the caseworker was appropriate. Also, the department did not waive its sovereign immunity, and there was no merit to the breach of contract argument. The trial court did not err in not ordering production of the boy's records.</SPAN></P>

The lower superior granted the administrator partial summary judgment on the due process claim and granted the commissioners summary judgment on the slander claim. The court reversed the due process portion of the superior court's decision and held that a post-deprivation hearing satisfied due process when the board's action was a random, unauthorized act that was not the result of an established state procedure. The court held that the state courts provided the administrator with an adequate post-deprivation remedy. Moreover, the commissioners were protected by qualified immunity because at the time of the incident, no concrete law existed that would have compelled the commissioners to conclude that their actions violated federal law. Finally, the grant of summary judgment on the slander claim was proper because the commissioners' statements were merely an expression of opinion.</SPAN></P>

The patient's guarantee to pay for chiropractic services could not include the guarantee to pay for any type of non-chiropractic service, including massage. Second, the court held that the contract between the parties was void under Ga. Code Ann. &sect;13-8-1 because the massages were not authorized by law as chiropractic treatment. And finally, the court addressed the constitutional claims and held that the statute did not violate the chiropractor's equal protection rights because it was not arbitrary and capricious, it did not violate his due process rights because massage services did not fall within the scope of chiropractic practice, and it did not impair his right to contract because he had no vested right to perform massages and charge for them.</SPAN></P>

The DeKalb County Superior Court (Georgia) granted summary judgment holding that the workers' compensation tort bar of Ga.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An employee of a temporary labor agency was injured when a pole he was using to clean out a railcar touched high voltage lines.

He also asserted that the High-voltage Safety Act, Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 46-3-30 to -40, which protected a power company from liability for work performed near high-voltage lines unless notice of the work was given to the company, was unconstitutional. The court held that the employee was a borrowed servant of the chemical company and that his sole remedy was workers' compensation because once he was assigned to work for a special master, the agency relinquished its control. Summary judgment for the power company was proper because it was protected under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 46-3-39(a) by the failure of the employee and chemical company to give the notice required by the Act. The claim that the Act was unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious because it did not require the power company to identify which lines were high-voltage was irrelevant because the chemical company had actual notice of the high voltage.</SPAN></P>

The probate court granted the motion on the basis that the ward had been emancipated by marriage. The ward filed an action in the trial court to set aside the dismissal, based on the fact that no accounting and settlement had been made and that she had not received notice of the proceeding. The ward's motion was granted. The insurer, which had posted the surety bond in the course of the guardianship, challenged the decision. On appeal the court reversed, holding that the trial court was without jurisdiction, under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-11-60, to rule on the ward's motion. The ward could attack the probate court's judgment only on direct appeal because the judgment was not void on its face. While the ward had alleged procedural defects, they were not apparent on the face of the judgment. A judgment void on its face was limited to judgments that lacked either personal or subject matter jurisdiction. Because the ward was not entitled to personal service, notice by publication being expressly provided for by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-11-4 (j), the probate court had jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the officer's momentary detention of defendant's vehicle was reasonable despite being based on another jurisdiction's recalled dispatch, where the recall of that dispatch one hour earlier was not seasonably communicated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient received x-rays of his spine after he was injured in a car accident. The providers read the x-rays and failed to recognize a fracture of a vertebra. As a result, the patient received no treatment. When the patient's back pain recurred, x-rays revealed the fracture damage, which by that time had worsened. The patient argued that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the providers because the statute of limitation began to run not when the providers misread the x-rays, but when he learned his vertebra was fractured. The court reversed the summary judgment order. The court stressed that the patient did not allege that the misdiagnosis caused his broken back. The complaint was based on the worsened compression of his spine. The evidence showed these injuries occurred sometime between the misdiagnosis and the correct diagnosis. Because the subsequent injury was difficult to date precisely, the statute of limitation ran from the date symptoms attributable to the new injury were manifest to the patient. The providers failed to show that the patient had any manifestations of the new injuries until less than two years before suit was filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commission argued that the legislature intended to have provided that the rates of a local exchange company were deemed just and reasonable on the effective date specified by the local exchange company in its election notice, and it was on that date that the local exchange company became subject to alternative regulation. The telephone companies argued that on the date they filed their notice of election of alternative regulation the commission lost its jurisdiction to have determined the telephone companies' appropriate earning levels and to have adjusted their rates. The court reversed the judgment in favor of the telephone companies. The court held that the legislative intent of the Georgia Telecommunications &amp; Competition Development Act of 1995, Ga.

The court granted the tenant's motion for voluntary dismissal of his appeals of a second issuance of a writ of possession and his appeal of a trial court determination that the tenant had not timely paid money into court pending appeal, and affirmed the issuance of the first writ of possession. The court held that there was no automatic transfer of a dispossessory action from the state court to the superior court, upon the tenant's timely answer, because the statute that once provided so had been superceded by subsequent legislative enactment. The tenant had also contended that proper notice of the foreclosure was not given and that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 44-14-162.2 was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The county reassessed the property's fair market value in 1990 without the owners filing an appeal or protest.

In 1993, the taxpayer sought a refund or the 1990-year. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing the taxpayer's complaint. The court found, inter alia, that (1) the refund procedure delineated in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-5-380 was limited to the correction of errors of fact or law that had resulted in erroneous or illegal taxation; (2) the taxpayer's claim based on mere dissatisfaction with an assessment, or on an assertion that the assessors did not take into account matters that the taxpayer believed should have been considered, did not assert that an assessment was erroneous or illegal within the meaning of &sect; 48-5-380; and (3) the taxpayer's claim for a refund of taxes was based not on any inaccuracy in the factual record or any illegality in the procedure used to reach an assessment, but on a disagreement with the amount of the assessment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed from the rulings of the DeKalb Superior Court (Georgia), which tried defendant for armed robbery as an adult pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 15-11-5 (b)(2)(A)(vii). A jury convicted defendant, and the trial court sentenced him to 10 years in prison. The trial court refused to sever defendant's trial from that of his co-defendant and admitted defendant's custodial statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court instructed the jury to consider the guilt or innocence of each defendant separately, and the jury acquitted the co-defendant. On appeal, the court deemed that the acquittal was evidence that the number of defendants was not so great as to cause confusion of the evidence and the law. The court found that the co-defendant's statement was properly admitted with a cautionary instruction and held that antagonistic defenses did not mandate the severance of co-defendants. The court held that any violation of the juvenile arrest procedures outlined in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 15-11-19(a) did not render defendant's custodial statements inadmissible, but rather, that the issue was whether defendant made the statements after freely, knowingly, and voluntarily waiving his Miranda rights. The court also ruled that it had no authority to decide a constitutional challenge to the facial validity of the juvenile transfer statute, but it noted that the possibility of a life sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment and that a defendant had the burden to show purposeful discrimination in an equal protection challenge, not mere statistical disparities.</SPAN></P>

The trial court gave the surety time to present evidence, which it did not do. On appeal, the court held that 1992 Ga. Laws p. 2933, &sect; 4(d)(1) was not applicable. The court determined that pursuant to 1992 Ga. Laws p. 2933, &sect; 4(d)(3) the surety, as the debtor and the party seeking the reduction of the debt under the statute, had the burden of producing evidence that it located the accused. The court noted that the surety would have earned a reduction of the bond amount by fulfilling one of the conditions set forth in the statute. The court concluded that the State's participation in the proposed consent order did not conclusively establish that one of the statutory conditions was met. Further, the court indicated that the surety was given adequate opportunity to present the prescribed evidence, and it failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that Georgia law provided under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-5-311 which challenged the unapportioned assessment of the ad valorem tax, the law also provided other avenues of review available to an aggrieved taxpayer or trucking company that challenged the validity of a tax prior to remittance of taxes but because the trucking company failed to pursue any of those remedies, the trial court erred in allowing the first trucking company to proceed under &sect; 48-5-311 for a refund of a portion of the ad valorem taxes they paid on their trucks. The court also concluded that the second trucking company's motion for partial summary judgment was properly denied based on the findings of the first trucking company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, franchisees and competing company, appealed the judgment of a Georgia trial court, which granted an injunction with no geographic limits prohibiting the franchisees and the competing company from franchising, operating, or advising others about the operation of stores selling hubcaps, wheels, and related automotive accessories.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court examined the grounds for the injunction and found none valid. The court held that the information franchisor claimed it needed to protect did not qualify as trade secrets. Thus, the Trade Secrets Act did not support the grant of the interlocutory injunction. For instance, the franchisor did claim the franchisee misappropriated a tangible supplier list, and the franchisee's personal knowledge of the franchisor's suppliers was not a trade secret. Also, the injunction could not be upheld as a remedy for breach of a confidential relationship because no such relationship existed where the franchise contract expressly provided for an independent contractor relationship between franchisor and its franchisees. The court held that one party was not under any duty to represent or advance the other's interests. The court further held that the injunction could not be based on the noncompetition clause of the franchise agreement because it was overbroad and void. The court also held that the franchisor's fraud claim failed because it did not show damages resulted from a false representation made by the franchisees and competing company.</SPAN></P>

The court was unable to determine from existing authority the answer to the question of whether the taxpayer's constitutional right was violated by the mooting of the action by reason of the payment of the taxes in question by a third party.

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court improperly admitted the results of his breath test and improperly denied his motion for new trial. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the trial court properly admitted the certificate of inspection showing that the Intoxilyzer 5000 was in good working order in December 1994 because (1) Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-392 (f) did not mandate that the breathalyzer's certificate of inspection be prepared on the day of inspection, and (2) defendant failed to cite any authority that mandated an inspection of the instrument immediately after his test. The court also held that the trial court did not err in charging the jury on the presumptions of intoxication at various blood-alcohol levels established by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-392(b) because it was not necessary for the State to show defendant's blood-alcohol level at the time he was initially stopped.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not err when it entered judgment against the attorney for an amount that was greater than the amount the attorney contended was the maximum the judgment could have been, but the court held that the amount of damages computed by the trial court was calculated incorrectly.

The victim filed a complaint against the officer for assault and battery, which was amended to add a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim against the officer and the city. The city brought a motion for summary judgment contending that the officer was not acting under color of law and there was insufficient evidence that the officer was acting in conformity with any city policy at the time of the altercation. The trial court granted the motion, and the court affirmed. The court held that, pretermitting the issue of whether or not the trial court correctly found that the officer was acting under color of law, there was no evidence sufficient to show that the off-duty altercation was the result of an impermissible or corrupt policy which was intentional and deliberate. Even if it could be argued that the city failed to properly investigate the charges against the officer, it did not sustain a claim under &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant Georgia Department of Human Resources (state) challenged a judgment from the trial court (Georgia), which awarded monetary damages to plaintiff mother for her daughter's life and for pain and suffering in a wrongful death and personal injury action. The daughter was a mental patient in a state hospital. The state contended that the judgment exceeded the statutory cap in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 50-21-29(b) (1992) of the Georgia Tort Claims Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The issue was whether the application of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 50-21-29(b) (1992), the part of the Georgia Tort Claims Act limiting damages recoverable against the state, would abridge the mother's state constitutional rights against retroactivity as provided in Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; 1(X). The court acknowledged that the Georgia Supreme Court had exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the issue and that the case could not be transferred because the state as the appealing party did not contend that the limitation was contrary to the constitution, but that the trial court erred in not reducing the judgment to conform to it. The court opined that it could have presumed constitutionality, reversed the judgment, and remanded with instructions to reduce the judgment, but that would have merely decided constitutionality sub silentio, prompting a petition for certiorari. The court held that the more direct and proper approach was to seek instruction and not delay the appellate process, resolving the issue definitively before other errors were addressed. The court held that the issue was timely because until the verdict exceeded the statutory cap, no ruling was required. The question was certified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court certified a question to the Supreme Court of Georgia, seeking instruction on whether the statutory caps limiting money damages recoverable by the mother under the Georgia Tort Claims Act in her daughter's wrongful death and personal injury action against the state were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court determined the prosecutorial misconduct was an improper basis for granting the double jeopardy plea in bar without some evidence that the intent of the state was to cause a retrial by its improper conduct. Additionally, the court determined that neither it nor the trial court had the jurisdiction to determine the constitutional issue presented by defendant and that issue would not be ripe unless and until the state prevailed in the remanded double jeopardy issue in the trial court.

A jury found defendant and codefendant guilty of trafficking in cocaine, in violation of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-31. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that codefendant's motion for a directed verdict of acquittal was properly denied because, while a finding of constructive possession had to be based on more than codefendant's spatial proximity to the cocaine, there was sufficient evidence that codefendant participated with defendant in the purchase of cocaine. Further, codefendant's motion challenging the life sentence provisions of Ga.

On appeal of that decision, the court expressed concern over the use of the recidivist statute and remanded the action to determine the validity of defendant's sentence. On remand, the trial court conducted a resentencing hearing and sentenced defendant to life in prison. The court affirmed that decision. It was not disputed that under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-5-40(b), the only sentences authorized for a conviction of kidnapping with bodily injury were life imprisonment or death. However, defendant contended that the statute was unconstitutional. He attacked the statute because it robbed the trial court of any discretion to sentence him to a lighter sentence regardless of the severity of the injury. The court had previously considered and rejected that argument in other cases. Accordingly, that enumeration was without merit. Although defendant also argued that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of kidnapping with bodily injury, that issue was previously resolved against him by the court in the prior appeal.

Code Ann. &sect; 34-9-11.1(e) provided that the amended provisions were to apply retroactively to injuries occurring on or after July 1, 1992. The employee's injury occurred on August 12, 1992. Because the statute was given retroactive effect, the court found that the automatic assignment language did not apply to the employee's action, and she brought it within the applicable statute of limitations. The court stated that the tortfeasors had no vested right in the assignment of her claim under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 34-9-11.1(c). The court reversed the dismissal of her complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted respondent wife's application for a discretionary appeal of the decision of the Thomas Superior Court (Georgia), which held her in contempt for violating the visitation provisions of a child custody order. Petitioner husband had filed for contempt charges alleging that the wife had willfully deprived him of visits with the child. The trial court ordered the wife jailed if she did not made the child available for visitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parties were divorced. The trial court also ordered that the wife could purge herself of the contempt by paying attorney fees and costs. The wife contended on appeal that the adjudication was criminal, not civil contempt, that an award of attorney fees was not part of any prior order, thus she could not be held in contempt for failure to pay fees which were not due yet, that the incarceration sanction was excessive, and that the evidence to support the adjudication was insufficient. The court found that to the extent that the trial court's order conditioned the wife's avoidance of, or release from, incarceration upon payment of attorney fees, it was erroneous. Thus, that portion of the trial court's order was reversed. However, the court found that though the manner of imposing incarceration for not paying the fees was improper, the actual award of attorney fees to the husband was authorized. However, in making that award, the trial court failed to properly consider the husband's financial circumstances and the order was vacated with respect to the amount of attorney fees and the case was remanded for a more detailed consideration of the parties' financial circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, employer and former employer, challenged the decision of the Chatham Superior Court (Georgia), affirming the award of compensation to appellee claimant. They disputed the claim for benefits under the Georgia Workers Compensation Act (Act), Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 34-9-1 et seq., claiming the Longshoremen's &amp; Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 901 et seq., had exclusive jurisdiction and disclaimed responsibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The claimant was injured while an employee of the former employer and received LHWCA compensation. While he was on leave, appellants' merger agreement ended and he returned to work as an employee of the employer. The claimant continued to experience back pain and began experiencing muscle cramps in his leg. He suffered a cramp while at work that rendered him unable to get off a ladder. He applied for benefits under the LHWCA and the state act. The administrative law judge granted him benefits under the state act and found that his claim constituted a change in condition, which decision was affirmed by the appellate division and the superior court. The court also affirmed, finding that while the claimant's injury was clearly compensable under the LHWCA because it occurred on navigable waters, it was also covered under the state act as neither federal nor Georgia law precluded such coverage. In addition, the claim constituted a change in condition, as his duties at work were the same, he began having the muscle cramps after the initial injury, they gradually worsened, and the claimant had no other traumatic incident or injury that caused him to stop work.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that there was concurrent jurisdiction under the LHWCA and the state act and that the claim constituted a change in condition, not a new injury. It the affirmed the award of benefits to the claimant under the state act, holding the former employer responsible for the award, and reliving the employer of responsibility.</SPAN></P>

The court held that neither could the trial court merely advise petitioner of the legal aspects of possible future consequences of possible future action on petitioner's part.

The state revenue department audited the taxpayers' state income tax returns, determined each taxpayer's tax liability based only on the particular taxpayer's income and deductions, and apportioned income using a different apportionment method. The lower court held that the taxpayers were entitled to choose their own method of apportionment. On appeal by the tax commissioner, the court affirmed the lower court's decision. Because Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The inmate was sentenced to 12 months confinement, but the sentence allowed that upon 90 days work release, the remainder could have been served on probation. His participation in the program was terminated, following a disciplinary proceeding, after he reported to work drunk. He was placed in the county correctional institute to serve his full sentence in accordance with the trial court's order. The inmate's action against appellants, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, alleged improper confinement, the denial of credit for time served, and improper termination from the program. The court reversed the denial of appellants' motions for summary judgment. Given the terms of the sentence imposed, a supplemental order of the trial court, and the inmate's agreement to participate under terms that authorized no good-time credit for participation in the program, the inmate's right to good-time credit was not established and the defense of qualified immunity defeated the claims against the warden and officer. Further, the inmate identified no county policy which was responsible for any of the alleged deprivations, and therefore, he could not prevail on his claim against the county.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that defendant's assertion that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unconstitutional if the John Doe did not have sufficient minimum contacts with Georgia did not violate his due process rights because any judgment against John Doe would not be an in personam judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff retired employees sought review of the decision of the Troup Superior Court (Georgia), which granted the summary judgment motion of defendant employer in an action alleging a violation of the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Georgia Constitutions, for breach of employment contract, for breach of fiduciary duty, and for negligence and fraud in the administration of a retirement benefit plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employer, a city, offered a retirement benefit plan. The city's mayor and council proposed two early retirement programs. The first incentive program allowed certain employees to retire and receive a monthly contribution toward their post-retirement health insurance premium until Medicare eligibility. The second incentive program allowed certain employees to retire and receive free health insurance until Medicare eligibility. Thereafter, the employees filed an action against the city for, inter alia, a violation of their equal protection rights and for breach of fiduciary duty. The trial court granted the employer summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that because one employee retired prior to the adoption of either program, the administration of the program did not affect his rights. Further, because the other employees retired prior to the administration of the second program, its administration did not affect their rights. Thus, the employees did not have standing to bring an equal protection challenge. Moreover, the employer's lack of knowledge and inability to predict city council's conduct precluded the employees' claim for breach of any duty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, a natural father and paternal grandmother, challenged the judgment of the Candler Superior Court (Georgia), which granted appellee step-father's petition to adopt a minor child and granted the grandmother limited visitation of the minor child under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 19-8-19, upon her motion to intervene in the adoption proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The minor child was born out of wedlock shortly after the natural father was incarcerated for two 15-year sentences in a correctional institution in Wisconsin. The mother and step-father were married in Indiana and moved with the minor child to Georgia. An Indiana trial court adjudged the natural father to be the minor child's natural father at his behest. Approximately two months later, the step-father commenced the underlying adoption proceeding. An Indiana court granted the petition for grandparent visitation rights. The trial court granted the petition to adopt and the petition for grandparent visitation rights, and the natural father and grandmother appealed. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Indiana's court did not make a custody determination, and the visitation determination was made after the child had lived in Georgia for over six months. Thus, the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1738A, did not apply, and Georgia could properly exercise jurisdiction. There was clear and convincing evidence that supported the order of adoption, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The visitation issue was moot, and the court dismissed it.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the Authority's motion to dismiss due to failure to comply with the provisions of the Georgia Tort Claims Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The longshoreman was injured at one of the Authority's terminals and he and his wife instituted an action claiming personal injury and loss of consortium. The Authority sought to dismiss on the basis that the Georgia Tort Claims Act had not been complied with and the trial court granted the motion. On an appeal by the longshoreman and his wife, the court affirmed, holding that the Act applied to the Authority. The court held that, pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 50-21-22(5), the Act applied to, inter alia, &quot;authorities&quot; of the State of Georgia. When the Act was enacted, the Authority was already in existence and by its very name was an &quot;authority&quot; of Georgia. Absent evidence to the contrary, no change was intended in the Authority's status as to sovereign immunity and the Act therefore applied. The contention that the Act's notice requirements could not be applied to the present action retroactively was briefed and transferred to the State's high court, which transferred the case back to the court without explanation. Such a transfer was a final determination that no constitutional question was in fact properly raised, or if so raised, was not meritorious.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant board sought review of a decision from the Murray Superior Court (Georgia) granting partial summary judgment to appellee teachers on the issue of liability in the teachers' class action suit challenging the board's decision to terminate the employer matching portion of a previously established annuity retirement savings plan for its employees. The teachers claimed the board's action violated Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. X (1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">As an incentive to attract quality employees, the board offered a retirement savings plan to the school district's employees that fully matched participating employees' contributions of two percent of their salary and match 50 percent of additional contributions. When the board terminated the latter contribution provision from the plan, the employees filed suit claiming that termination of benefits was an unconstitutional impairment of contract in violation of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. X (1983). The board appealed after the trial court granted the employees' motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability. The court held that the plan was a part of the employees' contracts, which provided for future amendment or termination of the plan at the board's discretion. Where the employment contracts provided that the terms of the plan could be modified or changed in the future, the participating employees never acquired a property right in the benefits. Because no property rights had vested, the modification did not violate the employees' constitutional rights. The judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant contended that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-8-41(b), under which he was sentenced, was unconstitutionally vague because it provided two maximum sentences, one of life imprisonment and another of 20 years. The court indicated that it disagreed with defendant's argument because, although &sect; 16-8-41(b) allowed the sentencing judge broad discretion, it did not provide two different maximum sentences and was not unconstitutionally vague. The court noted that although the courts of the state had consistently held that the maximum penalty upon conviction for armed robbery was life imprisonment, a court also was empowered to impose a determinable sentence of any period of time between 5 and 20 years. The court concluded that since Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-8-41 (b) was clear in its provision for a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and the sentence of life imprisonment imposed by the trial court was within that limit, there was no error in the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court determined that the claimant, rather than the driver, owned a car that was seized during a drug raid and denied the State's petition for civil forfeiture under &sect; 16-13-49. The court affirmed that judgment on appeal. The court concluded that the claimant's ownership interest, as against the State, was complete when the driver voluntarily transferred possession of the vehicle for valuable consideration and the claimant obtained from the transferor the duly transferred certificate of title thereto several months before the drug raid. The court also held that the claimant's failure to register it so as to authorize its use and operation on the public highways did not defeat his legal ownership of the car, noting that the Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-3-1 et seq., was a recording statute that was designed to perfect and to give notice of security interests. The court further found that the claimant proved that the driver's sale of the car was a valid transaction that had economic substance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state appealed from the orders of the Habersham Superior Court (Georgia), which dismissed charges of felony theft and forgery on the basis of double jeopardy, and dismissed other charges on the basis of the statute of limitations. Defendant, a former mayor, had completed probation on a sentence received under a plea agreement that waived any procedural defenses and allowed the state to recharge him if he ran for public office again.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant had been charged with crimes arising from his office and agreed that in return for first offender treatment, he would never run for office again. The state recharged him when he completed his probation and ran for office. On appeal, the court held that the restriction was unenforceable after the expiration of defendant's probation, so that it was only relevant as a triggering event. The court held that the trial court properly dismissed the identical offenses as barred by double jeopardy because defendant had already been tried, convicted, and served his sentence, and any general waiver in the plea agreement was ineffective as to double jeopardy. On the other charges, the court held that the statutes of limitation were not jurisdictional, so the passage of time did not automatically bar the charges. The court held that a statute of limitations could be waived by defendant and applied the same test used for waiver of a jury trial: whether the waiver was made both intelligently and knowingly. The court found that the state had met its burden because both defense counsel and defendant had executed the plea agreement that waived the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court insofar as it held that prosecution of the identical offenses was barred by double jeopardy. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court insofar as it held that the prosecution of some offenses was barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged certain rulings made by the trial court. Defendant argued that testimony regarding an incident with the victim's grandfather would have shown that the child had knowledge that sex acts could occur between adults and children.

Defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to show that evidence would have been excluded at trial on any proper ground but for the failure of counsel to file a timely motion to suppress. The trial court properly admitted documentary evidence that showed defendant's state of mind and his lustful disposition toward children generally. Defendant failed to show that the trial court's ruling that the witness could only testify to any change she had seen in defendant's character during the period at issue infringed upon his ability to defend against any specific allegation made by the State. According to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-12-102(1) it was immaterial whether a defense expert considered the materials to be harmful to minors.

The court held that: (1) evidence of defendant's two prior selling cocaine offenses was admissible similar transaction evidence because the State submitted proper purposes for admitting the evidence, proving identity and modus operandi, and the trial court specifically admitted the evidence on the issue of identity; (2) the trial court did not fail to limit the purpose for which evidence of similar transactions could have been used by the jury; (3) the court was not able to consider defendant's challenge to Ga.

Both defendants admitted the deceased threw the victim on the hood of her car and raped her.

Both were convicted as charged. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgments of the trial court. The court had no jurisdiction over claims that the statutes were unconstitutional. The charges were brought in the correct county because the venue was determined from the second kidnapping that occurred in the wooded area.

After a bench trial, the superior court determined that defendants' property was used to facilitate a violation of the Georgia Controlled Substances Act in the manufacture and growing of marijuana. Defendants argued that the superior court erred in determining that the property on which the marijuana was located was outside the curtilage of the house. Defendants argued that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy in that portion of their property. The court held that the police officers were justified in their seizure of the marijuana and that defendants had no reasonable expectation of privacy. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment of the superior court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A majority of the court did not think that the appeal should have simply been dismissed without requiring the trial court to look into whether defendant should have been given another opportunity to appeal.

The court ordered that the trial court report its findings to the court with regard to defense counsel's failure to prosecute the appeal and that the trial court inquire into defendant's need for appellate counsel and ordered the trial court to take such action as appropriate. The trial court had the burden of looking into the situation even if defendant did not act, to determine why defendant's counsel did not perform and whether defendant needed new counsel.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the repeated violations of the motion in limine was reversible error. The court held that the manufacturer did not waive error by not objecting every time at trial because error was preserved by the granting of the motion in limine. The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to exclude testimony of a former employee of the manufacturer because he did not testify regarding privileged matters. The court held that it was error to permit the introduction of a deposition from a prior case because the cases were unrelated. The court held that evidence of subsequent remedial measures would be admissible if it tended to prove some fact at issue. The court held there was evidence to support the punitive damages and that they were not unreasonable. The court held that the jury instructions on punitive damages were erroneous.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that it was error to convict him of violating both Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-13-30 and &sect; 16-13-32.5.2 because there was no merger of the crimes.

He asserted that the language of the statute referring to any other dangerous or deadly weapon or instrument of like character had to be construed as being limited by the words: &quot;designed for the purpose of offense and defense.&quot; The court held on appeal that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of the case. Reading the statute as a whole, the phrase &quot;designed for the purpose of offense and defense&quot; did not limit the phrase &quot;any other dangerous or deadly weapon or instrument of like character,&quot; which was a &quot;catch all.&quot; The court concluded that the fact that a scalpel was not designed for purposes of offense and defense did not mean that it could not be concealed as a dangerous or deadly weapon or instrument under certain circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of rape, aggravated sodomy, kidnapping with bodily injury, aggravated assault, and simple battery. The trial court denied his motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and vacated in part. The court vacated defendant's rape conviction because it was the &quot;rape&quot; that was the basis for the &quot;bodily injury&quot; portion of the kidnapping with bodily injury offense. The court determined that these two offenses merged. The court affirmed the remainder of the judgment. The court ruled that defendant's proposed testimony concerning alleged statements made by the victim to defendant concerning her past prostitution, relationships with black men, and fear of getting pregnant were properly excluded under the Rape Shield Statute,&nbsp;Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 24-2-3, which superseded any statement that would have been otherwise admissible as res gestae. Defendant's testimony was not admissible under the exception to the Rape Shield Statute,&nbsp;Ga.

The appellate court affirmed the trial court's issuance of the injunction, and held that clear and convincing evidence showed that the competition restriction was the least burdensome restriction necessary to protect appellee's interest because appellee's liquor store was the only such store in a small community.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The alleged victim asserted that defendant agreed to sell several pieces of antique furniture for her and that she was to receive a sum from the sale. After defendant took the furniture to his shop, the victim did not hear from him for some unspecified time. According to the victim, defendant assured her that he would pay her the money, but when she visited his shop he was never there. The victim also testified that she spoke with defendant's employees, but a hearsay objection as to what they told her was sustained. No other witnesses testified for the prosecution. The court reversed defendant's fraudulent conversion conviction on the ground that the evidence was insufficient. Because the victim's testimony did not establish fraudulent intent as required by &sect; 16-8-4, the conviction ran afoul of the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt. The prosecution failed to establish what happened to the furniture and that defendant knowingly and with fraudulent intent appropriated it for his own use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant optometrist appealed the decision from the Ware Superior Court (Georgia), which denied the optometrist's motion for summary judgment in the professional malpractice suit brought by plaintiffs, parents and injured child, for an alleged misdiagnosis of an eye abnormality. The optometrist alleged that the suit was untimely pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-3-73(c)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The optometrist treated the injured child for amblyopia. The optometrist did not inform the parents and injured child that she had an optic nerve disease even though the optometrist wrote that fact on the injured child's chart. Approximately four years after the last treatment, it was discovered that the injured child suffered from Coats' disease. The evidence was that the child had the disease when she was treated. The appellate court reversed. Section 9-3-73(c)(2) applied to the optometrist. The two-year medical malpractice limitations period, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-30-71, applied to more than just the practice of medicine. However, when an injury occurred subsequent to treatment, the limitations period commenced on the date the injury was discovered, which was four years after the treatment. Thus, the suit would have been timely if not for Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-3-73(c)(2). The time for repose was not computed from the time the injury arose but rather from the time of the negligent act. Under &sect; 9-3-73(c)(2), the injured child's claim was barred since she had essentially five years to file suit from the misdiagnosis. There was no evidence of fraud to toll the limitations period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The denial of summary judgment to the optometrist was reversed, and he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Under the Georgia repose statute for minors, the suit was untimely. The statute applied to optometrists. There was no evidence of fraud, which would have tolled the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no evidence of any official city policy or custom of using excessive force, nor was there any evidence that the city endorsed a policy or custom of handling intoxicated arrestees in a manner that resulted in injury. Furthermore, the court held that there was no evidence of other incidences suggesting any widespread informal policy or practice constituting a custom or usage with the force of law. The court also held that there was insufficient evidence to create any factual issue in support of any claim of inadequate training. The court held that the force the officer used was not such that would have been clear to a reasonable police officer that using such force would violate the arrestee's Fourth Amendment rights not to be subjected to an unreasonable use of force during his arrest.

Defendant and his co-defendant then approached the car, and defendant stood to the side as his co-defendant sold the drug. The court held that this evidence was sufficient to show that defendant was a party to the sale of cocaine. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a severance. The court found that defendant failed to show prejudice from this ruling and that a common trial was warranted because the criminal conduct involved the same place of occurrence, the same undercover agents, and the same transaction. In addition, the court rejected defendant's claim that the sentencing provision of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-7 was unconstitutional. The court held that defendant did not have standing to contest the validity of &sect; 17-10-7 until he had a right of parole, and the statute was asserted against him as a bar.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff board and defendant sheriff both appealed from the judgment of the Wayne Superior Court (Georgia), which held that the board had properly adopted a county personnel system pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-21, but that the sheriff could refuse to reappoint employees in the sheriff's office pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 15-16-23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board had recently enacted a county personnel system and one of the last acts of the outgoing officeholder was to request that the employees of the sheriff's office be covered by the system. The first thing the sheriff did upon taking office was to notify the employees that he was not reappointing them to their positions and to appoint new deputies. The sheriff argued that the personnel system had not been validly adopted because &sect; 36-1-21 required action by ordinance or resolution and the board had acted by motion to adopt the system. The court held that the term resolution included action by motion. The court held that the enactment of &sect; 36-1-21 did not repeal &sect; 15-16-23 by implication and reconciled the two by holding that once positions in a sheriff's office had been made subject to the personnel system, the sheriff's authority to appoint deputies pursuant to &sect; 15-16-23 was limited to vacancies created by the removal of employees in the manner provided under the personnel system or vacancies created when employees resigned or retired. Thus, the sheriff had no authority to discharge or fail to reappoint the employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment holding that the county personnel system was properly adopted but reversed its holding that the sheriff could discharge or refuse to reappoint employees in the sheriff's office covered by the system.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court stated that the jury, as the trier of fact, was properly left to determine what was cruel or excessive physical or mental pain. The court found that defendant's due process rights were not violated when he was not permitted to cross-examine a witness for the State. The court noted that the witness's testimony pertained to the nature of her relationship with defendant and was completely irrelevant to the issue of whether defendant was guilty of cruelty to children. The court held that the trial court did not commit reversible error by allowing the State to inject defendant's character into evidence. The court stated that the testimony was elicited as background evidence regarding the child's primary caregivers, and that any error in allowing the testimony was harmless. The court noted that because defendant did not argue the constitutionality of the statutory definition of reasonable punishment in the trial court the issue was not preserved on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court found that because the former patient brought her action more than five years after the date of the alleged negligent act, the statute of ultimate repose barred it. Therefore, the court held that defendants were entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. The court also held that defendants were entitled to summary judgment because it was undisputed that the former patient's contraction of AIDS was not the natural or foreseeable proximate result of a blood transfusion known within the medical community at the time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant patient challenged a judgment of the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia) granting the motion of appellee physician to dismiss her medical malpractice action on the grounds that the affidavit of a registered nurse was, pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-11-9.1, insufficient evidence regarding the medical standard of care applicable to administering the drug Phenergan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient filed a complaint alleging that the physician negligently injected the drug into the patient's lower hip area, which caused her injuries because the drug should have been injected into the upper hip area. She contested the judgment of dismissal rendered by the trial court, which the court reversed. The court held that the affidavit supporting the patient's complaint constituted sufficient proof to satisfy &sect; 9-11-9.1 that the methods of treatment for injecting the drug, by nurses and doctors, were the same. The court found sufficient proof of the nurse's overlapping expertise to establish that she was competent to provide the affidavit stating the standards of care regarding the giving of Phenergan injections in both the nursing profession and in the medical profession. The court reached that conclusion based on the statutory definition of the practice of nursing encompassing the giving of injections, the averments in the affidavit, and the patient's allegations of negligence. The court accepted the affidavit's conclusion that the physician's performance fell beneath the medical profession's standard of care by injecting the drug in the wrong place on the patient's leg.</SPAN></P>

Even though the collateral source statute, authorizing the admission of evidence of collateral source payments, had been declared unconstitutional the rules in effect prior to the enactment of the statute still governed. Because the victim broached the issue of insurance payment on direct examination when she averred that she stopped going to a physician because insurance had stopped paying, defense counsel was entitled to cross-examine her on the point.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the trial court did not err in failing to issue defendant's requested instruction to the effect that victim's testimony would be sufficient to authorize a finding of robbery by intimidation because such a charge was argumentative and incomplete. Robbery by intimidation was a lesser included offense in the offense of armed robbery. The victim's testimony authorized a finding of either armed robbery or robbery by intimidation. The trial court properly instructed the jury on both armed robbery and robbery by intimidation. It was not incumbent upon the trial court to specifically point out particular evidence in behalf of defendant that the jury should specially consider.</SPAN></P>

The jury found against the newspaper on the two counts, one for each article published, arising out of a cause of action filed by appellee sexual assault victim, pursuant to the Georgia Rape Shield Statute,&nbsp;Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-6-23, which made illegal the publication of the name of a sexual assault victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The police testified at trial that they made it clear to the newspaper's reporters that they were treating the incident as a sexual assault. The police further testified that they were reluctant to give out the name of the sexual assault victim and finally did so only with the understanding that her name would not be published without her permission and that publication otherwise would violate the state's Rape Shield Statute. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, concluding that imposition of liability for invasion of privacy for publishing the name of a sexual assault victim was not precluded by existing case law. The court ruled that while crime was a matter of legitimate public interest, the victim's privacy interest in protecting her identity outweighed any legitimate public interest. The court ruled that since the constitutionality of the Rape Shield Statute was not ruled upon by the trial court, it could be raised on appeal and, in any event, the state supreme court had sole jurisdiction on a question of the constitutionality of a statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A patient was prescribed the anticoagulant drug Coumadin after surgery. Two weeks later, on August 26, 1989, she began to have nausea and other symptoms and was admitted to the hospital. Tests confirmed that she was hemorrhaging, which the patient and her husband later claimed was caused by the physician's and hospital's failure to monitor her properly while she was taking the drug. The patient and her husband filed suit for medical malpractice and loss of consortium. The trial court granted summary judgment for the hospital, physician, and hospital authority. On appeal, the court held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-3-71(a) provided that malpractice actions had to be brought within two years after the date on which an injury arose from a negligent or wrongful act or omission. The patient's cause of action accrued when her symptoms began on Aug. 26, and her initial subjective belief that her symptoms came from some cause unrelated to negligence did not change the running of the statute. The court also held that the statute of limitations applicable to the claim for loss of consortium was four years, as set forth in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-3-33, so the husband's cause of action was viable.</SPAN></P>

The court further determined that charging the jury with the entirety of Ga.

After the hearing, the trial court denied the Batson motion. In reversing, the court found that as to 3 of the 4 black potential jurors, counsel offered a racially neutral reason. As to the fourth, age was offered as a neutral explanation related to the case. However counsel went further and indicated that he was also skeptical of the prospective juror's denial on voir dire that she actually knew the injured person or the witnesses who would testify in the case. The court determined that an assumption that the prospective juror would act along racial lines and engage in misconduct constituted an impermissible assumption ultimately arising solely from the juror's race.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After a meeting between labor unions, the union member was charged with use of fighting words and simple assault. The union member filed a plea in abatement as to the fighting words charge and demurred to the charge of simple assault. The trial court dismissed the charges. On appeal, the court reversed the dismissal. In stating that fighting words were not constitutionally protected, the court held that the state enacted Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-11-39 and Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-5-20 to curtail criminal activity before it escalated into or caused immediate acts of actual violence. The court stated that under the circumstances, the exercise of criminal jurisdiction posed no significant threat of interference with the policies and jurisdiction of the Railway Labor Act. The court held that the violation of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-11-39 was based on the utterance of fighting words while the simple assault violation was based on certain physical conduct. Therefore, the trial court erred in dismissing the simple assault charge as moot, and the existence of a labor dispute did not give any party to the controversy an unfettered right to violate an applicable criminal law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the judgment with respect to his statutory rape conviction, alleging that: 1) &sect; 16-6-3 was unconstitutional; and 2) there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">During defendant's trial, the underage victim of the statutory rape testified to the sexual conduct she experienced. On appeal, the court first considered whether defendant's claim that &sect; 16-6-3 was unconstitutional required it to transfer the action to the Supreme Court of Georgia, which was given exclusive jurisdiction by Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6, para. 2(1) to hear challenges to the constitutionality of legislation. Because defendant had neither sought nor obtained a ruling from the trial court on the statute's constitutionality, the court declared that the issue had not been preserved for appellate review. The court rejected defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction; in doing so, it recognized that &sect; 16-6-3 declared that a statutory rape conviction could not be based solely on the unsupported testimony of the female. However, the female's testimony did not need to support every essential element of the crime. Because the child's testimony was corroborated by defendant's testimony, and would lead a reasonable trier of fact to rationally find defendant guilty of statutory rape, the evidence was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

Section 33-5-10(b) provided that no adult entertainment premises could be licensed to sell alcoholic beverages if it was located within 1,000 feet of the boundaries of any residential zoning district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court noted that, by its terms, the ordinance related solely to the county's issuance of a liquor license and provided that no such license was to be issued to adult entertainment premises located within certain geographic areas. Under this ordinance, appellant would not be entitled to a liquor license for his adult entertainment premises if he were seeking one from the county. However, appellant had a liquor license that predated &sect; 33-5-10(b) and nothing under the terms of that ordinance prohibited him from featuring nude dancing at his bar and restaurant. The court also noted that Fulton County, Ga., Ordinances &sect; 33-5-11(5) enumerated acts that no holder of a liquor license could allow to occur on the licensed premises. However, the language of that ordinance tracked the former Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 3-3-41, which had been held unconstitutional. The county could not forgo an attempted prosecution of appellant under the possibly unconstitutional &sect; 33-5-11 by urging that &sect; 33-5-10(b) was itself a criminal provision that prohibited appellant, in his capacity as a holder of an existing liquor license, from featuring nude dancing at his bar and restaurant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant State of South Carolina and its department of corrections appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Lincoln County (Georgia), challenging the court's jurisdiction under Georgia's Long-Arm Statute,&nbsp;Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-10-91(3), in a tort action filed by plaintiff administrator and next friend of the decedent and a seriously injured individual, who were both attacked by an escaped South Carolina prison inmate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The administrator of the decedent's estate and next fried filed two actions against the State of South Carolina and its department of corrections in the State of Georgia, alleging that certain negligent acts and omissions of employees of the department had enabled an inmate to escape into Georgia and fatally wound the decedent and seriously injure another individual. The trial court consolidated the cases and denied the state's and the department's motions for summary judgment, finding that the contacts requirement of the Georgia Long-Arm Statute,&nbsp;Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-10-91 et seq., had been satisfied because the state and the department transacted business in Georgia, at a minimum in the form of tourism solicitation and received revenue from taxpayers who lived in Georgia, but worked or owned property in South Carolina. The court reversed and remanded with directions to dismiss the actions for lack of personal jurisdiction. Sufficient contacts did not exist between Georgia and South Carolina within the meaning of &sect; 9-10-91(3) to authorize personal jurisdiction. To say otherwise would have resulted in an unconstitutionally broad construction of Georgia's Long-Arm Statute.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the superior court's judgment dismissing the patient's suit and concluded that the patient had failed to comply with Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-11-9.1(a). The surgeon who removed the wire testified that the wire removed was not the kind used to thread a catheterization line, and that she did not recognize the type of wire and was unable to identify a procedure in which such a wire would be used. As such, the surgeon's testimony failed to specify at least one negligent act or omission committed by the hospital or physicians as required under &sect; 9-11-9.1(a). The court concluded that the patient could not amend the action to add a different medical expert's affidavit because she failed to allege in her original complaint that she was unable to obtain an affidavit because of time constraints as required under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-11-9.1(b). Also, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-11-9.1(e) did not apply since the doctor's affidavit was dated after the patient's suit was filed.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 19-11-1 et seq., for recovery of public assistance benefits paid on behalf of a child from appellee, the child's father. The trial court denied the claim because the father's parental rights had been terminated several years previously.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The father's parental rights were terminated, with his consent, in an action brought by the child's mother. Subsequently, DHR provided public assistance benefits to the child, and then sought to recover the amount of those benefits from the father. On appeal, the court affirmed because the father's obligation to support the child was extinguished by the termination order, pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 15-11-80. The parent-child relationship remained intact, but the obligation and right of support, which was otherwise predicated on that relationship, was terminated. The termination order was not void because Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 15-11-81(b)(1) specifically authorized a termination of parental rights upon the written consent of a parent. Nor was the order void because the child was not represented by a guardian. The statute in effect at the time that the father's rights were terminated, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 15-11-55, did not specifically require the appointment of a guardian in every case. Moreover, even if the child had not been represented by a guardian, the termination order would not be void and subject to DHR's collateral attack.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that denied DHR's claim for recovery of public assistance benefits paid on behalf of a child from the child's father, whose parental rights had previously terminated.</SPAN></P>

The Cobb State Court (Georgia) denied the insureds and insurer's motion to bifurcate the claims. The jury found in favor of the bicyclist. The insureds and the insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The bicyclist was injured when one of the insured's struck him with her car while the bicyclist was riding on a public street. The insureds and insurer contended that the trial court erred by denying their motion to bifurcate the trial. Specifically, the insureds contended that the jury's consideration of the claims against the insurer allowed evidence in the trial of the negligence claims that the insureds possessed liability coverage. The appellate court held that the trial court abused its discretion by denying the motion to bifurcate. The court found that there was no express statutory provision in the Georgia Motor Vehicle Accident Reparations Act, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 33-34-1 et seq., authorizing the joinder of the claims. The admission of evidence of insurance coverage was inherently prejudicial, and prejudice was one of the statutory grounds for severance under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-11-42(b). Given the prejudicial nature of the evidence, the joinder was not justified on the grounds of judicial economy. Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 51-12-1(b), which allowed evidence of collateral sources, was previously held unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from an order of the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), which convicted him of armed robbery and aggravated assault. He contended, in part, that the trial court violated his right pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 15-12-133 to question jurors about any inclination or bias respecting the action, counsel or the parties when it prohibited his counsel from questioning prospective jurors about possible bias against defense counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The charges against defendant arose from an incident in which he robbed a woman and stole her car. While fleeing in the car, he ran into a policeman who was reporting for duty. He was eventually apprehended, after drawing a rifle on the officer. On appeal, the court affirmed. Although defense counsel should have been allowed to ask prospective jurors about potential bias toward criminal defense attorneys, in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt, the State met its burden of showing that it was highly probable the limitation on voir dire was harmless error. The victim's testimony that defendant had a gun wrapped in a coat, which he pointed at her while taking her keys and pocketbook was sufficient to infer the presence of a weapon, even when the victim did not actually see the gun. The trial court properly instructed the jury on flight because defendant's case was tried before the Georgia Supreme Court's decision holding that from that point forward no trial court should charge a jury on flight. Considering the totality of the circumstances, any suggestiveness in a photographic lineup did not give rise to a substantial likelihood of mistaken identification.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the dismissal of the parents' claims based on precedent from the Georgia Supreme Court which held that &quot;wrongful life&quot; claims implicitly and &quot;wrongful birth&quot; claims explicitly could not be recognized in Georgia absent a clear mandate for such recognition by the legislature. The court declined to transfer the matter directly to the supreme court based on the parents' contention that the holding was violative of their constitutional right to due process. The parents did not raise an issue of constitutional construction and the supreme court decision was not a state &quot;law&quot; that would give the supreme court jurisdiction over a constitutional challenge to its continued viability. The parents could seek a writ of certiorari for supreme court review of their claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions holding that independent testing of the machine could not establish that defendant's results were inaccurate since the original testing conditions, including defendant's physical state, could not have been duplicated. The court held that defendant was not denied the right to introduce evidence the machine may have malfunctioned by the court's refusal to allow him to test the machine. As to the admission of the breath test results, the court held that the admissibility of breathalyzer test results was controlled solely by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-392, and in this case, the officer who administered the tests was authorized by the State of Georgia to perform chemical analyses utilizing the Intoximeter Breath Analyzer 3000 machine. Finally, the court held that as to the issue of the admissibility of the test results, the test results were not excludable because the examiner failed to wait 20 minutes between defendant's arrest and the first test and then again by not waiting 20 minutes between the first and second test. The court held that the record revealed that at least 45 minutes had elapsed between the traffic stop and the first test.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had entered a plea of guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol to the extent that it was less safe for him to drive, driving with a blood alcohol concentration in excess of 0.12 grams, and failure to stop at a stop sign.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was stopped after his car failed to stop at a stop sign. After failing a field sobriety test, a portable Alcosensor test was administered and defendant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and running a stop sign. The implied consent warning was read to him and he was transported to the jail. An Intoximeter 3000 test was then performed, and one of the officer's assisted defendant in telephoning the only facility in the county that performed independent chemical analysis. However, defendant did not have sufficient funds for the test. At trial, defendant entered a plea of guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol, driving with a blood alcohol concentration in excess of 0.12 grams, and failure to stop at a stop sign. The trial court denied defendant's motion in limine to exclude the results of an Intoximeter 3000 test. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the officer made a reasonable effort to accommodate defendant's efforts to obtain an independent test. Also, the test results were admissible under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 392 because defendant was properly advised of his right to an independent test.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not err in giving the jury an Allen charge and did not err in denying a mistrial on the ground that the jury was deadlocked. The court held that there was no evidence of a deadlock and a motion for mistrial based on the length of a jury's deliberation was within the sound discretion of the trial court.

The court found no constitutional requirement that a defendant receive the benefit of rehabilitation before a life sentence for repeated conduct might be imposed. The Supreme Court of Georgia had rejected a similar constitutional attack on &sect; 16-13-30. Defendant failed to elicit a ruling from the trial court on the statute's constitutionality; thus, it was not before the court for appellate review.

The patient's physical symptoms were obvious when she was still being treated by the physician. The statute of limitation was not tolled by the physician's alleged fraud because the record contained nothing to suggest the patient was prevented from learning of the alleged negligence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-30(d) was not unconstitutional merely because a prosecutor had the same discretion whether or not to proceed under it as he had in any other criminal case. The court held that a prosecutor could selectively enforce any statute so long as he did not do based on race, religion, gender, or any other basis that violated Equal Protection principles. The court also held that the legislature had broad discretion to define crime and to determine the appropriate punishment. The court found that the drug problem was so serious that it provided a rational basis for the legislature to impose a mandatory life sentence for repeated drug sales. The court noted that Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. II (1983) and the Equal Protection Clause of the federal constitution were coextensive, so the state constitution did not require a different result. The court also ruled that the mandatory life sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that there was no statutory prerequisite as to a conviction that antedated the offense for which the accused was sentenced under &sect; 16-13-30(d).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from the rulings of the Hall State Court (Georgia), which entered judgments of conviction and sentences on jury verdicts that defendant was guilty of public drunkenness and obstruction of a law enforcement officer. The charge of obstructing a law enforcement officer was predicated upon resistance to arrest for disorderly conduct under a statute subsequently declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The disorderly conduct statute was declared unconstitutional between the arrest and the trial. On appeal, the court held that an arrest was not unlawful within the common law right to resist, if the arrest was authorized by statute, although the statute was later declared unconstitutional. The court ruled that the validity of the arrest depended on the law as it existed at the time of the arrest and not as it was later declared. The court noted that it would not have been proper for the law enforcement police officer to take it upon himself to pass upon the validity of a statute and that it was the duty of the officer to enforce the law until repealed or held invalid by a court; and likewise, it was not the right of an individual to resist arrest on the basis of a contention that the law he allegedly was violating was unconstitutional or invalid for some other reason. On the public drunkenness charge, the court held that a strong smell of alcohol, demeanor, mannerisms, and an attitude indicative of intoxication were sufficient to support a conviction and that it was for the jury to judge the credibility of defendant's explanation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed defendant's convictions of public drunkenness and obstruction of a law enforcement officer.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions for obstruction of a law enforcement officer and for driving with an expired license and improper taillights but reversed her conviction for disorderly conduct. The court held that pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-8-7, and &sect; 40-8-23 the evidence was clearly sufficient to show that the officer acted in the lawful discharge of his official duties when he stopped defendant's vehicle for the offense of driving an improperly equipped vehicle. A factfinder could have found that defendant's refusal to provide identification to the officer could have hindered the officer in the execution of the officer's duties. The court agreed with defendant that her conviction and sentence for the offense of disorderly conduct under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-11-39(3) had to be reversed because the statute that prohibited such conduct was declared unconstitutional prior to the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged the trial court order that modified his sentence by increasing the amount of restitution originally set. Defendant was found guilty of stealing a car that was a rental car. The trial court originally set restitution at $ 600, but when the rental car company stated its damages the restitution amount was increased. Defendant claimed that the trial court's order was invalid because the attempted increase was ordered both after the term of court in which sentence initially was imposed and more than 60 days from the date sentence was imposed by the judge, in violation of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-1(a). Defendant also argued the order was invalid because it increased his punishment after he had commenced serving his sentence. The court affirmed the trial court order. The court found that the trial court had authority to modify the restitution order to include the rental company's damages. The court held that when error in determining the amount of damages was discovered, the proper procedure for correcting the error was to reopen the issue for further evidence and a new finding on the amount of damages, including the rental company's damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court order that increased the amount of restitution that defendant was required to pay because the increase did not constitute an impermissible increase or enhancement of defendant's punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant pled guilty to an offense that occurred on June 19, 2989. The offense was possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. He was sentenced to five years probation. On December 8, 1989, he was arrested on a charge of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and was found guilty. The trial court revoked defendant's probation, found him guilty of the June 19 offense, and in accordance with Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-30(d), regarding second offenses, imposed a sentence of life imprisonment for the June 19 offense. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by setting aside defendant's probation, adjudicating him guilty of the June 19 offense, and sentencing him accordingly because the evidence supporting defendant's conviction for the December 8 offense was sufficient to establish that defendant violated his probation. The evidence showed that defendant had possessed a plastic sandwich bag filled with crack cocaine and that defendant was carrying a beeper and large amounts of cash. The court held that defendant's conviction of the June 19 offense was a second conviction for a &sect; 16-13-30(b) offense and that a life sentence was mandated by &sect; 16-13-30(d).</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 16-7-60, encompassing both the intent to commit the proscribed act and the knowledge necessary to form that intent. Although the indictment did not recite the statutory section, the court found it obvious from her brief that defendant was unquestionably aware that she was charged with a violation of that section. The court found defendant's argument that the indictment did not apprise her of which of the two manners provided in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-2-1 was alleged not persuasive. The court found no violation of defendant's Miranda rights. Rejecting defendant's argument that the trailer was no one's home at the time of the fire, the court found that it was the marital home of the deceased and defendant. The court found no error in the trial court's quashing of defendant's subpoena to the State's crime laboratory personnel, or in the instructions given.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The injured parties filed medical malpractice actions against the hospital. The hospital filed motions for summary judgment in each action, and the motions were denied. The hospital filed interlocutory appeals.

The hospital was created and operated under the Hospital Authorities Law, Ga.

The injured parties' claim that the hospital's reserve fund was a self insurance fund that would require such a waiver of the hospital's immunity was without merit, as was the claim that the malpractice actions could be construed as actions for breach of contract. The court noted that the power to &quot;sue and be sued&quot; meant only that a government entity had the status and capacity to enter the courts; it did not signify a waiver of sovereign immunity against suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the accusation on the ground that it was not prepared on a uniform traffic citation properly approved for use by the Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety and omitted required items. Defendant's class of license was omitted, and there was no space for commercial vehicle information. There was no notice that, pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-6-11, if defendant's license was surrendered in lieu of cash, a copy of the citation served as his temporary license. Defendant also contended that his breathalyzer test results should have been excluded because it was not shown that the test was conducted in accordance with O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-392(a)(1). The court upheld defendant's conviction. There was no suggestion that defendant was misled or prejudiced in his ability to present a defense because of the alleged deficiencies in the citation. The officer who performed the breathalyzer test testified that he was certified to operate the machine and that he had conducted the customary pretest procedures before administering the test. There was also testimony that the machine was periodically serviced.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the conviction, the court held that: (1) the prosecution was not abated because there was a clear demonstration of legislative intent that prosecution of the conduct under the former law should not abate with the re-defining of the crime; (2) the burden of proving the applicability of exemptions under Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 10-5-3, 10-5-5 was on defendant; (3) the indictment, proof, and jury instructions were sufficient on the issue of the willfulness of defendants actions; (4) defendant did not have a right to appointed counsel because he was not determined to be indigent; and (5) the prosecution was not barred by the statute of limitation because the four-year limitations period applicable to defendant's case did not include any period in which the crime was unknown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted by a jury for attempting to steal a moving truck, and he appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the evidence was sufficient to authorize the jury to convict defendant on all three counts, and that: (1) the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for acquittal on the charge of possession of tools for the commission of crime since the position of the tools in the truck cab and a broken truck window indicated that the tools were used to break into the truck; (2) as the trial court's recharging of the jury on a certain issue was a correct statement of the law, there was no error in the trial court's denial of defendant's request to recharge on an incorrect principle of law or of defendant's request to be heard before the jury was recharged; (3) the introduction into evidence of a certified copy of defendant's prior conviction was sufficient to satisfy both the identity and similarity requirements for admission of independent crimes evidence; and (4) the sentence imposed was within the range authorized by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-4-6(b) and thus defendant's objections had to be addressed to the sentence review panel as provided in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-6.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Manufacturers of a watch brand filed a lawsuit in federal district court against defendant for selling counterfeit watches. The federal court granted an application for an ex parte seizure order. When federal marshals went to defendant's residence to execute the order, a marshal found cocaine and marijuana in defendant's bedroom. The marshal telephoned county police, who prepared an affidavit and obtained a search warrant for defendant's house. The police executed the warrant, seized drugs and paraphernalia, and arrested defendant under the Georgia Controlled Substances Act. Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence of the contraband upon the bases that it was found in the execution of an unconstitutional civil search and seizure under the Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 and seized pursuant to a subsequently issued illegal search warrant. The trial court denied the motion and convicted defendant of possession of cocaine. The court affirmed the decision. The court held that defendant's constitutional challenges were without merit. The court found that there was probable cause for the county police's search warrant and that the exclusionary rule did not bar the evidence.</SPAN></P>
