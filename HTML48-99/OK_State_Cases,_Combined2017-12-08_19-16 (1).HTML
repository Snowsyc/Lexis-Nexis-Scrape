The Honorable Raymond Naifeh, District Judge.  WILLIAM R. BURROWS, appellant, was convicted of Murder in the First Degree, in the District Court of Oklahoma County, Case No. CRF-77-2769, was sentenced to death, and he appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction by the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) for the first degree murder of his pregnant wife. Defendant also appealed the death sentence imposed by the trial court based on the jury's finding that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, an aggravating circumstance pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.12(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the admission of evidence of his wife's pregnancy was reversible error. The court agreed that the fact that the victim was pregnant at the time of her death was irrelevant during the first stage of the trial, and that defendant's motion to exclude that evidence should have been sustained by the trial court. The court found, however, that the introduction of the evidence in this case did not contribute to the jury's finding of guilt. With regard to the sentence, the court found that the evidence amply supported the finding that the murder was aggravated by the circumstances of being an especially heinous killing. In addition, the court held that the second aggravating circumstance found by the jury, that the accused knowingly created a risk of death to more than one person, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.12(2), was constitutional. The court ruled, however, that under Okla. Stat. &sect; tit. 21, &sect; 701.11 (Supp. 1980), the death penalty could not be imposed if mitigating circumstances outweighed aggravating circumstances. Here, two of the three judges found that there were sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant modification of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for murder in the first degree and modified the sentence from death to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

Billy Walker, petitioner, was convicted of Indecent Telephone Conversation in the District Court of Comanche County, Oklahoma, Case No. CRF-79-616.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By petition for writ of certiorari, defendant sought review of a judgment from the District Court of Comanche County (Oklahoma) that convicted him of indecent telephone conversation in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1021(4) (Supp. 1980) and set punishment at one year imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that defendant made phone calls to an unwilling listener at which time he used words that were offensive to decency and calculated to excite lewd thoughts. Defendant was convicted of indecent telephone conversation in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1021(4) (Supp. 1980). Defendant contended that &sect; 1021(4) was unconstitutionally overbroad because its scope was not limited to cases where the listener did not consent to the use of the proscribed language. On appeal, the court disagreed that &sect; 1021(4) was overbroad. The court determined that the limitation that the prohibited language be spoken to an unwilling listener was implicit in &sect; 1021(4). The court found that a prosecution for an obscene telephone call to which the listener did not object would not occur, for without an offended party to report the incident, it would not come to the attention of law enforcement officials. The court found that the means chosen by the legislature were both appropriate and sufficiently narrowed to achieve the legitimate goal sought to be attained. The court ruled that &sect; 1021(4) was constitutional and that the trial court had proper jurisdiction to find defendant guilty.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed on appeal. The court held that the motion in limine during the sanity proceeding, requesting that no reference be made to the murder charge, was properly overruled because the jury's knowledge of the charge was essential to enable them to determine whether appellant had the mental capacity to appreciate the nature of the charges. Evidence of appellant's knowledge of right and wrong was relevant to the determination of his competence to appreciate the nature of the charge and to assist counsel in the preparation of his defense. A medical report, which was not admitted as evidence, was properly used for impeachment purposes, and appellant was not deprived of his right to confront witnesses. Lay persons' testimony pertaining to appellant's conduct six months prior to trial was not too remote. Evidence of a prior conviction was admissible at trial because it was relevant to the self-defense theory. The jury instructions properly required the state to prove malice, and did not shift the burden of proof to mitigate the homicide from murder to manslaughter to appellant.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the admission of photographs taken of the deceased at the scene of the homicide was not an abuse of discretion. The court found that the location of the victim's body and the number and location of his wounds were established by the photographs. There was no error in the jury instructions that included the element of intent, as the second-degree murder statute, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.2(1) (1975), required a finding of specific intent. The court found that the jury instructions fully informed the jury of the State's burden of proof on the question of defendant's &quot;design to effect death.&quot; Although there is a presumption of prejudice arising from comments on defendant's post-arrest silence, the presumption was cured because the comments were only about defendant's silence regarding his self-defense theory.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two crimes and was released on bail when the trial court issued an ex parte order for his arrest and incarceration until he could be brought before the trial court for a hearing.

Defendant ran out his back door and threw two bags over a fence. The bags were seized and were found to contain capsules that were used as evidence against defendant. Defendant asserted that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress the drugs used as evidence against him at trial because they were the product of an illegal arrest and search. The court ruled that the drugs were not admissible into evidence for the reason that they were seized as the result of an illegal arrest. The court decided that there was no act of abandonment by defendant because defendant's act of throwing the bags over the fence was directly caused by the officers' unlawful presence and was not sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint of the unlawful invasion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants invited a man to sit with them and some other women at a bar. When he left, the women, including defendants, followed him and demanded his billfold. When he refused to turn it over, they started hitting him, knocked him to the ground, and removed his billfold from his back pocket. Defendants denied that they ever took part in the incident. The court held that a jury instruction on the lesser included offense of assault and battery was not required because under the evidence presented defendants were either guilty of robbery with force or innocent. The demand for the billfold, the evidence of beating, and the contemporaneous disappearance of the billfold represented a chain of events sufficient to establish a prima facie case of robbery by force or fear as defined by Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 791 (1971). Defendants' objection to another jury instruction was waived because defendants were aware of the instruction, failed to object, and declined to offer their own instructions. Finally, because one defendant admitted to certain prior convictions when she took the stand, no identification testimony was necessary to confirm that she was the person previously convicted.</SPAN></P>

He was seen by a neighbor climbing down from the victim's second-story window. He was thereafter convicted of second-degree rape and sentenced to one-year imprisonment. On appeal, defendant claimed that he was denied his right to counsel because his counsel appointed for the preliminary hearing was not available until one day before the hearing. The court noted that defendant raised no specific allegation of prejudicial harm after his opportunity for a continuance was offered and then denied. Next, defendant claimed that the rape statutes,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1111 et seq. (1971) were unconstitutional. The court noted that California's statutory rape law, which was essentially identical to Oklahoma's statute, was held to be constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. Finally, defendant claimed that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the verdict. The court found that the victim's testimony was not inherently improbable or unworthy of credence. Further, the court noted that the neighbor had made in-court identification. As such, the court found that the evidence was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant presented several claims that the trial court committed several errors pertaining to the admission of evidence. The court rejected defendant's arguments. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion as to the admission of certain photographs of the victim's body, as the photographs allowed the jury to determine the type of weapon used in the crime. The court further found that the trial court's determination that testimony of certain witnesses did not violate the hearsay rule was not an abuse of discretion and did not violate defendant's constitutional right to confrontation. The court also found that admission of a drawing of a knife did not inflame the jury. Defendant also argued that it was error for the prosecutor to comment on the failure of a defense witness to appear to testify. The court rejected this argument and noted that defendant's failure to produce this witness was a legitimate matter for comment by the prosecutor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the uncorroborated testimony of one witness was insufficient to sustain a conviction for homosexual solicitation under Okla.

Defendant argued that his prosecution under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1029 violated U.S. Const. amend. I. The court held that defendant's free speech rights were not violated because Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1029 prohibited the sexual acts solicited by the spoken words. Defendant asserted that Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1029 was unconstitutional under Okla. Const. art.

The court ruled that solicitation of prostitution was logically and reasonably related to aiding, abetting, or participating in prostitution. Defendant claimed that his one-year sentence was excessive. The court decided that the sentence was not excessive because Okla.

The trial court found defendant in contempt of court. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's argument that requiring him to represent an indigent was an imposition of involuntary servitude. Consent to the legal duty to serve indigents as appointed counsel was a precondition for admission to the bar; thus, defendant had accepted that duty. The court held that it was unethical for attorneys to refuse appointed representation without a justifiable excuse, that defendant was entitled to statutory compensation, and that the statutes requiring him to provide services to indigents when assigned by the trial court were not facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was 17 years old when committed armed robbery. The State filed a motion to certify him as an adult 14 months after the alleged crime. At a prospective merit hearing, the juvenile appeared pro se and was granted a continuance to secure counsel. Several additional continuances were granted to the juvenile, and eventually he was ordered to have all psychological examinations prepared. The trial court certified him to stand trial as an adult, to which the juvenile made no objection and failed to request a further hearing as provided for by Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1126(b) (1971). Affirming, the court held that the record was silent as to the juvenile's assertion of his right to a speedy hearing. The court observed that there were several continuances at the juvenile's request, and that he failed to vigorously assert his right to a speedy hearing. The court opined that no degree of prejudice resulted from the delay, and that he had a lengthy juvenile record and unsuccessful encounters with the criminal justice system. The court found no merit to the claim of error regarding defendant's physical appearance and denial of another motion for continuance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before Okla. Stat. tit. 57, &sect; 138, was amended, it provided for pre-crediting of time credits for work and good conduct as applied against the full term of a defendant's sentence. After &sect; 138 was amended, the procedure was changed to provide for internal monthly crediting of time after it had been earned. The first defendant, who had been convicted and sentenced for manslaughter, filed a petition for post-conviction relief, contending that &sect; 138, as amended, was an ex post facto law, inflicting greater punishment upon him than the law in effect at the time of the commission of the crime. The second defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus based on the same contention. The trial court entered judgments in defendants' favor. On appeal, the State contended that the amendment of &sect; 138 was not substantive, but merely changed the bookkeeping procedure employed in tallying accumulated time. The court determined that the only difference under the amended statute was that the work credits were calculated monthly and then only after they had been earned. The court concluded that defendants' rights had not been violated and vacated the trial court's judgments.</SPAN></P>

The court said that scienter was clearly established where an owner carefully selected the films, fully contemplating and intending that an employee would sell the items, and communicated special permission to his employee for the sale at issue. The court said that the prosecutor went outside the bounds when he asked a defense witness if he let his children view such films and when he spoke of parts of the community approving of burglary in discussing community standards. The court pointed out that crime charged was defined in part by community standards of acceptability; other crimes, including burglary, were not so defined and the prosecutor's remark was misleading. The court rejected defendant's argument that private individual voir dire was required in his case, finding no abuse of discretion. The court found no prejudicial error with regard to defendant's other arguments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the trial court's dismissal of the case against defendants. The court held that &sect; 211 prohibited the sale or dispensing of beverages, including beer, containing certain amounts of alcohol where dancing was permitted. There were numerous exemptions to prohibition, but the exceptions did not deny persons with licenses to sell beer equal protection of the law because there was no real distinction between the beer and intoxicating liquor could be made for purposes of regulation. Thus, the State had the same right to regulate businesses selling the beer because it had to regulate places selling intoxicating liquors. However, a police regulation that was valid when it is enacted could become arbitrary and confiscatory because of later events. A quick look in the Oklahoma City telephone directory yellow pages showed well over 60 hotels and motels listed in the Oklahoma City area alone. The distinction between motels and hotels in which the public might drink the beer and dance and other public places which sold the beer seemed to be completely arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

The State of Oklahoma brings this petition for writ of prohibition seeking review of an order of the District Court holding the certification procedure in 10 O.S.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner State sought review of a judgment from the District Court, Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) in favor of respondent judge in the State's case seeking a writ of prohibition to stop enforcement of the judge's order issued in conjunction with his ruling that Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 1101(a), 1104.2, 1109(a) (1979), regarding trial of certain teenagers as adults, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under &sect;&sect; 1101(a), 1104.2, 1109(a), most 16- and 17-year-old persons charged with certain serious, statutorily listed offenses were to be tried as adults. Three defendants in those age groups filed suit, contending, inter alia, that the statutes created a subclass of 16- and 17-year-old persons charged with felony offenses and discriminated against them in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by presuming class members to be adults once charged with any of the crimes listed in &sect; 1104.2 and requiring them to file a motion for certification as juveniles. The trial court found that the statutes were unconstitutional. The State sought a writ of prohibition. Upon review, the court held that the legislative classification bore a rational relationship to an important legislative objective, the public's protection. The court surmised that the legislature intended that most, if not all, 16- or 17-year-old persons being tried under &sect; 1104.2 be imprisoned for substantial time. The statutes at issue were not unconstitutionally vague and did not create a presumption that 16 and 17-year-olds accused of serious crimes should be dealt with as adults.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court upheld the convictions, but reduced the sentences. The court rejected defendant's argument that his series of acts was a single transaction with one objective and that, therefore, only one of the six charges should have been prosecuted. The court held that the victims' in-court identification were properly admitted for the jury's consideration. The court also held that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to disclose sperm slides taken from the victims. However, the court ruled that his conviction rested on overwhelming evidence. Lastly, the court modified the sentences because the jury assessed defendant's punishment according to an unconstitutional statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 51(B) (Supp. 1971).</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's claim that certain evidence regarding the possible reason for the officer's stop of defendant's car had been unlawfully withheld from defendant by the prosecution. The court also rejected defendant's claim that his status as a juvenile offender should have spared him the death penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was 17 years old when she allegedly committed murder but was 18 by the date of trial. The judge ordered her to stand trial as an adult under Okla.

After her objection to jurisdiction was overruled, petitioner brought her action and argued that the judge should have applied Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1112 (Supp. 1975), which was in effect when the crime was committed. The court agreed and granted the injunction. The court noted that, under &sect; 1112, petitioner was entitled to have a juvenile court consider eight statutorily defined guidelines in determining whether it should continue juvenile proceedings or certify petitioner to the adult division of the district court. The court also noted that the State had the burden thereunder to prove by substantial evidence that the case had prosecutive merit. Accordingly, the court concluded that Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1104.2 (Supp. 1979) was not merely a procedural statute and that, because it materially affected petitioner to her disadvantage, it could not be applied ex post facto.</SPAN></P>

Because &sect; 701.1 had been declared unconstitutional, life imprisonment was the proper penalty for conviction under the repealed statute. Defendant's jacket, boots, and jeans were confiscated by means of the warrantless search of defendant's residence. Not only was the search warrantless, it was conducted hours after the defendant was arrested and was in violation of U.S. Const. amend IV and Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 30. The trial court also erred when it admitted evidence that was immaterial and had no causal connection to defendant. The court found that the interrogation of defendant over the course of three days, which included a forced trip to Arkansas, compounded the illegality of defendant's confession. Because of the abusive tactics and procedural irregularities used in obtaining defendant's confession, the confession was inadmissible. Because defendant was not charged with armed robbery and, thus, was not within the purview of the first-degree murder statute, on retrial defendant could only be charged with murder in the second degree.</SPAN></P>

Dorothy Nell Hunt, appellant, was charged with the offense of Unlawful Sale of Movies Showing Acts of Sexual Intercourse or Unnatural Copulation; was sentenced to three (3) years' imprisonment and assessed a fine of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00), and appeals.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma), which convicted her on the charge of unlawful sale of movies showing acts of sexual intercourse or unnatural copulation in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1040.51 (1971) and imposed a sentence of three years imprisonment and a fine of $ 15,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after undercover police officers purchased several magazines and a film from her that were sexually graphic in nature. Defendant challenged her obscenity conviction and sentence, and the court affirmed with modification. The court held that &sect; 1040.51 was constitutional, and the information charging defendant was not defective. The jury's verdict was not contrary to the evidence, and expert testimony was not necessary for the jury to determine whether or not the film was obscene. Although the obscenity law was severe, its penalties did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, and while it was error for the trial court to fail to give a scienter instruction, the error was harmless because it was clear from the evidence that defendant knew the character of the film when she sold it. However, the prosecutor's remarks during closing arguments regarding the effects of pornography on the community were inappropriate and probably influenced the jury to return a more severe punishment than they might otherwise have done. Thus, the court affirmed the conviction, but decreased defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stipulated to the elements of the offense after his motion to dismiss was denied. At the motion hearing, defendant presented evidence that certain exclusive clubs had never been prosecuted for unlawful sale of alcoholic beverages. Agents of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board and police officers testified that those clubs had been investigated, but that no violations had been observed. The agents and the officers denied the employment of selective enforcement techniques. The court held that the evidence produced at the motion hearing did not support a claim of intentional, purposeful discrimination in enforcement. Defendant argued that Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect; 501 et seq. (1971), the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, violated the single subject rule. The court rejected this argument and held that the title embraced one subject, alcoholic beverages, which included licensing and control of the manufacture, storage, sale, distribution, and use. The term &quot;subject&quot; as set forth in Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 57 was to be given a broad meaning to allow the legislature to include in any single act all logically or naturally connected matters. The fine was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The State then sought a writ of mandamus directing the judge to vacate his order. The issue on appeal was whether the court's earlier decision to declare Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 1104.2, 1112(b), relating to &quot;reverse certification,&quot; unconstitutional had the effect of creating a void that precluded certifying juveniles for adult prosecution in felony cases. The court ruled that 1977 Okla. Sess. Laws 79, &sect; 2, the guidelines for certification, was constitutional. Under the 1977 law, when a hearing had the potential of becoming a certification hearing, notice must be given.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile alleged that the trial court committed error in failing to quash the summons and dismiss the petition because the summons was not issued within five days after the State assumed custody of him, as required by Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1104.1, para. (B) (1978). The court found that, when the time periods were computed correctly, the summons had been issued within the statutory five-day period. The court also rejected the juvenile's claim that he was illegally arrested and that the trial court erred in failing to strike his confession and to suppress all the evidence obtained as a result of his arrest, finding that the arresting officer had probable cause to take him into custody. Although the most current version of the certification statute had been ruled unconstitutional, the previous version of the statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1112(b) (1977), remained in effect during the certification proceedings, and the State, by assuming the burden of proof throughout, had complied with the statute. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the juvenile was not amenable to rehabilitation within the juvenile system, and the court affirmed its order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed that the judge at the preliminary hearing was not a properly appointed judge in that district court. The court could not find the issue preserved in the record but noted that the acts of a de facto judge had the same status as the acts of a de jure judge. The court construed Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1225 (1971) to allow any district judge, associate district judge, or special judge to issue search warrants to be served any place in the judicial district where such judge presided at the time. The court held that placing an induction coil on a telephone receiver through a suction cup was not an illegal seizure of an oral communication, where it was done by or with the consent of one of the parties to the telephone conversation. The court found nothing unconstitutional in the fact that Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-408 (1971) allowed a seven year sentence, while sentences for other conspiracies under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 421 (1971) were limited to a two year maximum.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree. On appeal, the court vacated the judgment. Although the warrant affidavit, standing alone, was insufficient to support the warrant, the affiant also gave oral testimony that provided probable cause to issue the search warrant. The four-week gap between the time the affidavit and the transcript of testimony were filed did not render the warrant invalid because it was only required that transcript and testimony be filed in the same place, not at the same time. It was error to conduct a warrantless search of defendant's house and garage after the victim's body was discovered. However, the State presented highly incriminating evidence that was not the result of the illegal search, and the illegally seized evidence thus did not prejudice defendant. In the same series of acts or transactions, Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 436 (1971) permitted a defendant to be charged with more than one count in a single information, and the information was thus not defective.

The court found that the ordinance left a number of questions unanswered, such as what determined the perimeter of the place, did that connotation encompass public or private property, and what was the difference between being a loiterer and a spectator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile's first point of error was that the trial court wrongly denied his request for an independent psychiatric evaluation. The court found that the record lacked any evidence that the State psychiatrist was incompetent or that the juvenile had serious psychological problems. Further, no motion for an independent psychiatric evaluation was made until the completion of the State psychiatrist's testimony at the certification hearing. The cost seemed to be an arbitrary amount set by defense counsel. The court held that the juvenile was not entitled to a private psychiatrist at the expense of the State. The court further held that the mere fact that the juvenile's companions were not certified did not show that the prosecutor abused his discretion, especially where, as here, the juvenile was the leader. The other offenders were younger and had cooperated with the police investigation. The determination that the juvenile was not amenable to rehabilitation within the juvenile system was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

She was mentally retarded and earned money by working as a housekeeper and baby-sitter. On the day of the incident, she was cleaning defendant's apartment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A case before the district court involved a youth who had committed robbery with a weapon. The district court found both Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 1104.2 and 1112(b) (Supp. 1978) unconstitutional and the State appealed. The court upheld the decision, holding that because robbery with a dangerous weapon if committed by an adult was punishable by a maximum sentence of life imprisonment was indicative of the gravity with which society viewed its commission and that even using the strict scrutiny test, protecting society from youthful armed robbers was a compelling state interest. The court found that it could not glean from the statutes what procedures were required if a 16 or 17-year-old was accused of one of 11 enumerated crimes or what the rights and responsibilities of either the State or of accused juveniles were and that for the court to determine an acceptable procedure would not be a matter of interpretation but would rather be an exercise in judicial legislation. As such, because it could not rewrite the statute on the pretext of construction, it held that Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1104.2 (Supp. 1978) and Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1112(b) (Supp. 1978) were void.</SPAN></P>

The court found there was competent evidence from which the jury could determine defendant knew, or should have known, the camera was stolen given the disparity in value between the camera and the merchandise. The court found defendant's claim he was denied equal protection during the penalty phase of the trial, because his sentence was enhanced due to what defendant called an invalid prior felony conviction, was without merit. The court found that the proper course of action was for defendant to seek post conviction relief of the prior felony and if successful the current sentence would be modified. The court found defendant failed to include any substance in his claim for errors in the empanelment of the jury.

The court's authority was limited to instances specified in Okla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4 and the state statutes. The court noted that the common law was responsive to constitutional mandates upon statutory construction. The court had a responsibility to construe the intent of pertinent criminal statutes in light of constitutional standards. The rules promulgated by the court further delineated and clarified the constitutional application of Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2404(B) (Supp. 1978). The rules did not exceed the court's jurisdiction.

The court reversed and remanded the judgment. The court held that the State made no effort to preserve the adequacy of the lineup. No record was made of what was said, no pictures were taken, and defendants were not provided counsel prior to the confrontation. The court ruled that this was an unnecessarily suggestive lineup, which denied defendants their due process. The court concluded that the former sheriff's eyewitness observation of the robbers could not be severed from his subsequent identification of defendants in the lineup. The quality of his observation of the robbers at the scene of the crime was questionable and his description to the police was extremely general.

The court upheld the trial court's judgment. First, the court held the language defining legal consent was applicable. The court reasoned that although consent was not an element of the offense, mental capacity to give legal consent was a question of fact to be determined by the jury. The court noted the prosecuting witness was a 16-year-old boy with a learning disability. Secondly, the court held that although the trial court improperly refused to give instructions on corroboration and consent, fundamental reversible error did not result. The court reasoned the record showed that there was sufficient corroborative evidence presented to sustain the verdict.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The thrust of the argument of defendant, a priest, was religious freedom. The court rejected his argument, finding that he was convicted for distribution of a controlled dangerous substance, not mere possession, and significantly, the person receiving the marihuana was not a member of the professed religion. The court held that the State had a sufficient compelling interest to prohibit distribution of a controlled dangerous substance to members of the public who did not receive the substance in anticipation of using it as part of the beliefs of an established religion. The court stated that if it accepted defendant's position, then any criminal action could have been defended by utilization of the religious defense, and individuals could have created privileges in the courts not uniformly available to the public. Defendant argued that he did not receive a fair trial because he was unable to speak with witnesses prior to trial. The court rejected his argument, finding that the trial court issued an order to the sheriff to afford defendant reasonable visitation opportunities with witnesses who were appearing on his behalf.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on pleas of guilty in the District Court, Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) for the offenses of grand larceny, larceny from a person, and attempted robbery with firearms after former conviction of a felony. Defendant was 16 and 17 years of age at the time the larcenies were committed, yet he was not given certification hearings. His applications for post-conviction relief premised on this challenge were denied, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his prior convictions had to be vacated because he was denied equal protection of the law and that the judgment and sentence rendered in his current case had to be reversed or modified for the reason that the convictions in the previous larcenies were void. The court found that there were differences between the adult and juvenile processes which made the question more than one of appropriateness. A juvenile convicted in an adult court could suffer loss of civil rights and disqualification from public employment, and the conviction could be utilized against him in later court actions. The court, therefore, found that retrospective relief had to be granted to those male persons who were prosecuted as adults without benefit of a certification hearing when they were between 16 and 18 years of age. Defendant had to be able to state some valid reason to believe that certification would have been denied. If he could do this, then he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing. The State had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that waiver of jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court would have occurred had a certification hearing been held.</SPAN></P>

Donny Ray Stephens, petitioner, was charged with the offense of Unlawful Possession of Controlled Dangerous Drugs; was bound over to stand trial in the District Court; at arraignment his Motion to Quash and Demurrer were sustained; petitioner was discharged, and bail was exonerated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged in an amended information with attempted sale or distribution of a controlled drug. Petitioner's motion to quash was sustained, the information was dismissed, and petitioner was discharged. The State's district attorney filed a new information, setting forth the same facts. A magistrate quashed the information and dismissed the new case. The district court reversed and vacated the magistrate's order. Petitioner sought a writ of prohibition or mandamus. The court issued the writ, holding that the failure of the State to appeal the district court's judgment in the first case, precluded the State from further prosecuting the second case. When the district court sustained petitioner's motion brought under Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 504 (1971), the order was a final order from which the State was required to appeal, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1053 (1971). Because petitioner entered his demurrer to the information in accordance with Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 503 (1971), which the district court sustained without directing that a new information be filed as provided in Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 508 (1971), the State's sole remedy was an appeal under &sect; 1053.1.</SPAN></P>

The court found that, the jury having been properly instructed on the law and having been presented with evidence sufficient to establish the crime of grand larceny, the claim was without merit.Defendant also asserted that the trial court erred in failing to suppress evidence of the tires.

Although two witnesses made statements that implicated defendant in two separate crimes for which he was not being tried, the trial judge properly admonished the jury not to consider them. The trial court did not err in allowing the firearms into evidence because the other robber admitted that they were used in the robbery. The judgments and sentences against defendant for prior offenses were properly admitted. The commission of the robbery tolled the running of the period under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 51(A) (Supp. 1976), which provided that no person could be sentenced as a subsequent offender when a period of 10 years had elapsed since the completion of the sentence for the prior conviction. The prior convictions were not too remote and stale to serve as the basis for enhancing punishment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a person who claimed he was a &quot;denturist,&quot; sought review of a conviction from the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma), which found appellant guilty of violating the State Dental Act of 1970, Okla. Stat. tit. 59, &sect; 328.1 et seq. (1971), for practicing dentistry without a license. Appellant challenged the requirement of a written work authorization.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the State Dental Act of 1970 (the Act) was unconstitutional because it was violative of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 2. He also argued that the Act created an unlawful monopoly in violation of Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 32. On appeal, court affirmed, holding that the Act was clear and unambiguous. Appellant's acts constituted the practice of dentistry, and he lacked required authorization. Under Okla. Stat. tit. 59, &sect;&sect; 328.39(g) and 328.40, it was unlawful for any dental technician to perform any phase of dental lab technology without a properly completed written work authorization from a licensed dentist. Legislature's right to regulate occupations and professions for the protection of the lives, health, safety, and welfare of its people was unquestioned. It was within the proper exercise of the police power for legislature to define and declare what was deemed injurious to public health, safety, and welfare. In a &quot;rule of reason&quot; analysis, the fundamental test of the reasonableness of a restraint was its effect on the public, and it must appear that conduct tended to, or was reasonably calculated, to prejudice the public interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court affirmed, holding that statute was designed to protect public health and was within purview of state police power. Exertion of power was exercised for an end, which was for general welfare, and means adopted were reasonably adapted to accomplish end. There was no per se violation because restraint was reasonable due to state's concern with health and safety of public. Statute was calculated to protect public rather than prejudice it.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant attacked the constitutionality of the statute under which he was convicted, complained of the prosecutor's closing argument, and alleged that he was denied a deferred or suspended sentence as punishment for asserting his right to a jury trial. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, holding that defendant and his roommate waived the Fourth Amendment protection of their right to privacy when the police were invited into their home. The court stated that the prosecutor's improper statements were not so fundamentally prejudicial that the district court's admonishment did not cure the error, and that it could not be concluded that the district court abused its discretion refusing to suspend all or part of the defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with attempting to obtain a controlled drug by forged prescription. The Creek County District Court (Oklahoma) sustained defendant's motion to dismiss, which raised the constitutionality of the Oklahoma State Board of Pharmacy's action in placing the drug Methaqualone in Schedule II of the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-201B (1971). The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court granted defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground that it was an illegal delegation of authority for the Legislature to create a felony without the necessary guidelines. The court disagreed with the trial court's findings. The court had previously held that while the Oklahoma Legislature could not delegate its constitutional power to enact laws, the Legislature could vest certain administrative functions in other bodies where it declared the policy and fixed the legal principles to govern the body in administering the functions. After examining Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-201, the court concluded that the Legislature in fact had established an ascertainable policy and standards to guide the Board of Pharmacy to classify new products that were deemed to have a potential for abuse as controlled dangerous substances. The court noted that the Act provided for notice of hearings. The Act also provided eight standards that were sufficiently specific to set forth the legislative policy and to properly limit the Board's discretion in classifying new products as controlled dangerous substances. Therefore, the trial court erred in entering its order of dismissal.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the district court's judgment, concluding that no error occurred. The court reasoned that the photo was properly admitted because it accurately depicted the victim and the crime scene, it corroborated two witnesses' testimony, and its probative value outweighed a danger of prejudice. The court also held that using the word &quot;damned&quot; in cross-examining defendant was not prejudicial and that arguing that the jury should have only followed the instruction on murder in the second-degree was merely a comment that the evidence showed that he should have been found guilty as charged. The court further found that the provision in &sect; 701.4 that defendant be imprisoned in the state penitentiary did not deprive him of equal protection of the law because the department of corrections had the discretion as to which penitentiary to which he was confined; an indeterminate sentence was not cruel and unusual punishment because the district court had the inherent power to suspend the sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile offender challenged the order of the juvenile division of the District Court of Creek County, Oklahoma, which waived jurisdiction and certified the juvenile to stand trial as an adult on the offense of first degree murder. The issues included whether the juvenile had been denied effective assistance of counsel and whether the standards to certify the juvenile for prosecution as an adult had been met.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was 17 years old and had a long juvenile record when he intentionally killed a state trooper with a shotgun. The trial court certified him for prosecution as an adult, and the child sought review. On review, the court held that a certification proceeding only had to make two findings: that the charges had prosecutive merit and that the juvenile was not amenable to rehabilitation within the juvenile system. The proceeding was not a full scale trial and did not have to meet all of the requirements of a trial or even that of an administrative hearing. By that standard, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling. It held that the juvenile's counsel had adequate opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses, prepare for the case, and to access all records reviewed by the trial judge. The trial court did not have to address the insanity defense at the certification hearing because it could be dealt with at the ultimate trial, whether as an adult or a juvenile offender. It was not necessary to show that the juvenile could not be rehabilitated, just that the juvenile system did not have the ability to do it, especially where he would leave the juvenile system when he turned 18.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's contention that the element of overcoming the victim's will occurred at the first unknown location was not well taken. The victim testified that in the second incident defendant slapped her and ordered her to remove her clothing, and she testified that she did so and had intercourse with defendant out of fear and against her will. In addition, where uncertainty existed as to the county in which a crime was committed, the accused could be tried in any county in which the evidence indicated the crime could have been committed.

Stat. tit. 21, &sect;&sect; 1435, 51 (1971) and sentenced them accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with burglary in the second degree after former conviction of a felony. The evidence showed that defendants had broken into the premises of a company at which one defendant was a former trainee, that they were arrested and read their Miranda rights, and that the reason that defendants had not stolen anything was due to the quick response time of security guards and police. After the prosecution rested, the trial court allowed it to amend its information to correct the name of the building that defendants had entered. On appeal, the court held as follows: (1) The amendment of the information was permitted by Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 304 (1971) because it did not materially prejudice defendants' rights. (2) Defendants had waived their right to complain about jury instructions when they failed to object at trial. (3) Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 51(B) (1976) was unconstitutionally vague because it limited the sentence imposed on a repeat offender with two or more convictions to a lesser sentence than one with a single prior conviction under &sect; 51(A). However, the unconstitutionality of &sect; 51(B) did not constitute reversible error. (4) Section 51(B) was severable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's decision to reduce one defendant's sentence so that both sentences were equal. As modified, it affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The investigator was the sergeant of both defendant and the agent in National Guard. The agent admitted being involved in narcotics previously and that he had been caught smoking marijuana in a National Guard truck months earlier. Defendant maintained his innocence. He argued that the classification of marijuana with amphetamines and barbiturates under &sect; 2-401 violated his due process and equal protection rights. The court found that the classification was not unreasonable or arbitrary. The legislature provided a proper framework to determine when and if certain substances should be reclassified under Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-201 (1971). The court would not substitute its judgment for that of the legislature based on conflicting, contemporary expert opinion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder when he shot two victims closely in time, and he was sentenced to death. The court modified his sentence to life imprisonment after holding that the punishment provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.3 (Supp. 1973) were severable from the definitional provision, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.1 (Supp. 1973). Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.1(8) (1973) was not unconstitutionally vague. The trial court erred in allowing a police officer to testify that he directed his investigation to defendant after talking with a suspected eyewitness, a small child. The police officer would not have been permitted to testify about the eyewitness's extrajudicial identification of defendant claiming defendant was the murderer. By allowing the police officer to state that after talking to the eyewitness, he directed his investigation to defendant, the jury could infer that the eyewitness told the police officer that defendant was the murderer. The testimony was error, but the error was not prejudicial because, even if the testimony had been properly excluded, there was more than enough evidence to justify defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellant's waivers were voluntary and in compliance with the law advising a defendant of his right to counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted for the shooting death of a liquor store clerk while in the commission of an armed robbery. Another clerk testified that two men robbed the store and that she heard two shots fired, but that she could not identify either defendant. A customer identified both defendants at trial and testified that she was shot in the head. A witness testified that he saw a car containing two men pass the liquor store three times and identified one of defendants as the passenger. Both defendants set up an alibi defense. The court held that the United States Supreme Court's holding that Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.3 (Supp. 1974) was unconstitutional did not render unconstitutional the entire act, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect;&sect; 701.1 - 701.6 (Supp. 1974), as that holding only prohibited the imposition of the death penalty in those cases where the jury had no discretion in rendering the sentence. For that reason, the jury instruction on murder in the first degree was not erroneous. The evidence, though sharply conflicting, supported the verdict.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was found guilty by a jury of murdering an insurance investigator during the course of burglarizing his office, in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.1 (Supp. 1974), contended, inter alia, that the statute was unconstitutional. The court agreed, holding that pursuant to the Oklahoma Supreme Court's interpretation of recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court, the death penalty could not be imposed where the jury was not vested with any discretion in the rendering of that sentence. The court therefore ordered that defendant's sentence be modified to life imprisonment. Although the prosecuting attorney made improper remarks in his closing argument, those remarks were made in response to provocative argument from defense counsel, and thereby did not constitute grounds for reversal. Nor were other allegedly improper remarks by the prosecutor so grossly improper and unwarranted as to justify reversal.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the court held that defendant waived an in camera hearing regarding his confession by holding the hearing in front of the jury and failing to request an in camera hearing. Furthermore, the court found that it was not error to allow the medical examiner to testify as to the condition of the victim's body because the State did not dwell on the gory aspects, nor did the testimony unduly emphasize the condition of the victim. The court also refused to find an error with admitting a photograph of the alleged murder weapon. Finally, the court held that the state's death penalty statute, Okla.

IXV and Okla. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 2 and 7 because an adult could only receive a maximum sentence of 30 days for the same violation. The court held that under the concept of parens patriae the legislature had the inherent power and authority to provide protection of the person and property of persons non sui juris, which included juveniles. The very purpose of the juvenile system was to treat juveniles in a different manner from adults. Thus, the challenged classification was constitutionally permissible. The indeterminate commitment authorized by law was not constitutionally impermissible as cruel and unusual punishment. It only provided the Department with the necessary custody of the juvenile in order to effectuate and achieve rehabilitation, and it was not a commitment for the purpose of punishing a juvenile offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with the misdemeanor offense of aggravated assault and battery in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 646(1) (1971). Subsequently, defendant filed a motion challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 646(1). As a result, the district court issued a court minute acquitting defendant and holding &sect; 646(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The State then lodged an appeal under the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1053.1 (1975). The court held that the district court erred in declaring Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 646 (1)&nbsp;unconstitutional because the term &quot;great bodily injury&quot; was not so vague and indefinite that defendant could not have reasonably understood that responsibility would attach for his actions. Regardless, the court found that because a non-jury trial was held, with the district court hearing evidence from both the State and defense, double jeopardy did attach and the constitutional provision against twice putting an accused in jeopardy for the same offense barred further trial of defendant for aggravated assault and battery and any lesser-included offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he was denied adequate private consultation with his attorneys prior to trial, and because of that denial they were unable to adequately prepare for trial. The record indicated that defendant received a fair trial and was represented by competent and well-prepared counsel. Without a showing of prejudice, the court could not say that the trial court abused its discretion when it overruled defendant's motion for continuance. Statements of the victim were properly admitted as part of the res gestae because of the shortness of time between the utterances and the infliction of the mortal wound, together with the fact that at the time the statements were made, the victim was profusely bleeding and gasping for breath and from which he shortly succumbed. Also, no trial court error occurred by admission of a blood stained strip of cloth used to tie the victim, or admission of colored slides of the victim's body taken after the homicide. Although no error was found, the court concluded that Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect;&sect; 701.5, 701.6, and cited case law, mandated a modification of the sentence to life imprisonment due to invalidation of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

Defendant additionally contended that the trial court erred in failing to either sever the two co-defendants' cases, or to grant outside counsel to one of the two co-defendants. The court concluded that no prejudice was shown. Because the granting of a severance was discretionary with the trial court, the court would not disturb the trial court's ruling, absent a showing that prejudice resulted. The court held that photographs of the victim were useful in establishing the corpus delicti of the crime. The court found that confessions of both defendants were properly introduced into evidence after appropriate determinations of voluntariness and adherence to constitutional requirements. The first search of defendant's car was legal because of exigent circumstances. The second search was illegal, but no prejudice was shown.

Stat. tit. 21, &sect;701.1(8) (Supp. 1973), in the District Court, Garfield County (Oklahoma). On appeal the sentence was modified to life imprisonment and affirmed as modified by the court. Defendant timely filed a petition for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended, inter alia, that he was entitled to an instruction on murder in the second degree because the evidence, if believed, tended to show that he was outside the death home at the time the fatal shots were fired, and that the state did not disclose reports that were clearly exculpatory and as such should have been disclosed to defendant before trial. The record showed that the jury was properly instructed on the need for premeditation for a finding of guilt of first degree murder, and from their verdict the court concluded that they did find the requisite premeditation. Defendant suggested that in the court's original opinion the wrong test was applied related to exculpatory evidence. However, defendant had apparently misunderstood the court's opinion. The court previously stated that the chain of speculative possibilities was too long to support defendant's argument of prejudice. The court did not mean that the lack of prejudice made the error harmless; the court meant that defendant's argument was too speculative to support the allegation of error.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that a hitchhiker he had picked up committed the murders. The court affirmed the conviction, but modified the death sentence to life imprisonment. Considering the manner of death and defendant's incriminating statements, the court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the first degree murder conviction for killing two or more persons in the same occurrence and that instructions on murder in the second degree and abandonment were not warranted. The court found no error in the admission of photographs of the crime scene because they were relevant to show premeditation and mass murder. Because the prosecutor's use of a rope during closing argument to show how one of the victims could have tied himself up was fair comment on the evidence, the court determined that defendant was not prejudiced by the argument. Where no state could find the name of the alleged hitchhiker among its driver's license holders, the court concluded that defendant was not prejudiced by not receiving such investigative materials. The court noted that Oklahoma's mandatory death sentence had been declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the court first held that defendant had not had a right to a trial by jury because the potential punishment for the offense charged under Tulsa, Okla., Revised Ordinances tit. 27, &sect; 171, a municipal ordinance, did not reach constitutional and statutory thresholds. Secondly, the court held that the ordinance was not vague or overbroad where the prohibition against public intoxication was well-defined and within the province of the State or municipality to regulate. Next, the court rejected defendant's argument that the ordinance meant to include only intoxication induced by liquor and not intoxication induced by the use of prescription drugs.

The court held that while the accuracy of a radar device could be determinative of defendant's guilt or innocence, it did not affect the validity of defendant's arrest. Defendant also argued that his arrest for speeding was a noncustodial arrest and that he was therefore entitled to be released upon his presentation of his driver's license to the patrolman. The court affirmed the judgment and the sentence imposed. The court held that defendant as a traffic violator was subject to the officer's authority and restraint from the moment he was stopped until such time as he was expressly released subsequent to the issuance of the applicable citation.</SPAN></P>

Defendants claimed the trial court erred by failing to treat one of the witnesses as an accomplice. The court held that the witness was an accomplice in the robbery as a matter of law, which made it incumbent upon the trial court to include an instruction concerning the testimony of the witness. The witness admitted that he was present when two accomplices discussed the robbery in his home, and the participants returned to his home after the robbery to divide up the proceeds. The witness also admitted that he helped to hide the proceeds. The court found the conduct of the witness would have supported an indictment and conviction for the crime with which defendants were charged. Thus, the witness was an accomplice whose testimony could not be used to corroborate the testimony of another accomplice who also testified at trial. The court found that there was sufficient direct evidence against the first offender to uphold her conviction. The evidence, however, was not sufficient to convict the repeat offender. The repeat offender had claimed an alibi for the time of the offense, and the State failed to link him to the crime.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that referring to the parole and the pardon procedures did not constitute prosecutorial misconduct because the State only argued what was the law and that which the jury would have ultimately read on a proper verdict form. The court further determined that the provisions in Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 750 (1975) constitutionally limited defendant's right to cross-examine the victim as to irrelevant sexual contact with someone other than him or her husband because there was no evidence that she consented to having sex with defendant and because his questions were only designed to embarrass her.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the district court's judgment and remanded the action for a clerical error's correction, finding that there was sufficient evidence of guilt and that the challenged statutes were constitutional. The court reasoned that there was clear evidence that defendant presented a false and bogus check when his account was overdrawn and rejected the claim that Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1541.1 et seq. violated his due process rights. The court concluded that a comparison to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-14-20, which was held to be unconstitutional, was improper due to differences such as the lack of a need to find criminal intent in &sect; 40-14-20 and that a bank's dishonoring of a bad check was not dispositive of guilt as defendant claimed, noting that a jury had to find the essential intent to cheat and defraud. The court also determined that not defining &quot;insufficient funds&quot; in the challenged statutes did not render them unconstitutionally vague because a person of ordinary intelligence could have understood that term's meaning.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was nothing to indicate an improper cross-examination of defendant by the state. The state's accusation during closing that defendant had obtained the state's &quot;game plan&quot; and formulated a defense therefrom was properly handled by the trial court by sustaining defendant's objection and admonishing the jury to disregard the statement. The court held that there was no evidence to support defendant's requested instruction of second-degree manslaughter. Nor did the trial court err in refusing to instruct on second-degree murder. Under either the state's or the defense's theory of the case, defendant intended to shoot his victims. Any error in failing to suppress the rifle that defendant owned was harmless because defendant admitted shooting the victims with it. There was sufficient evidence that defendant waived his self-incrimination rights, and that he received sufficient Miranda warnings at all times.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought an answer to a question of law related to a trial court order that held part of Okla.

In the trial court, the judge had challenged the part of &sect; 991a that limited the court's authority to suspend sentences of defendants with three or more felony convictions. The defendant in the trial court had four prior state court convictions and one prior federal court conviction. This defendant had pled guilty to larceny of merchandise from a retailer and received a two year suspended sentence. The court held that the trial judge committed fundamental and reversible error and noted that the legislature, under its general police powers, had vested authority to define criminal acts and their punishment and that in this case the exercise of that police power was reasonable and bore a reasonable relationship to a legitimate purpose, thus the courts could not interfere.

Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 11-902 (1971) was affirmed on appeal, filed a petition for rehearing, contending that he was prejudiced by the introduction of evidence at trial revealing his prior felony convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the prior felony convictions were void because they were incurred when he was a 16-year-old juvenile and he was not afforded the safeguards and benefits of the Juvenile Code. On review, the court noted that the record failed to establish that defendant was 16 years old but rather appeared to establish that he was 20 years old at the time he incurred the prior felony convictions. The only evidence that defendant had any involvement with the law as a juvenile was initially elicited by defense counsel on direct examination of defendant and no specificity of this involvement was presented. Therefore, defendant might not be heard to complain of one particular question of the prosecutor on cross-examination which elicited the same fact, which was that defendant had been in trouble when he was 16 or 17 years old.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's speedy trial claim because ten months between arrest and trial was not unconstitutionally lengthy given the amount of defendants, attorneys, motions and venue changes. The juvenile court's certification of defendant for trial as an adult was not error considering the seriousness of the crime and defendant's statements indicating no remorse. The state did not rely on defendant's statements for gathering evidence of his guilt, as there was sufficient independent evidence indicating his guilt. The trial court did not err in failing to exclude three veniremen for cause. The veniremen stated they understood the law, and would follow the trial court's instructions. The prosecutor's statements during opening statements were erroneous, but did not prejudice defendant. Defendant's death sentence was unconstitutional, and thus changed to a life sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that the dismissal of the petition was predicated upon noncompliance with Okla.

It argued that &sect; 1103(a) violated the separation of powers provision of Okla. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1, because the juvenile court, an arm of the judicial branch, was improperly delegated authority that was exclusively within the province of the executive branch, and also argued that the prosecuting attorney was the only arm of the executive branch authorized to prosecute juvenile cases. The court affirmed the order. It held that the intake function of the juvenile court, as delineated in Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 1103(a), 1109(c), did not encroach upon the executive branch, and that the legislature properly granted the juvenile court the necessary discretion in the intake process. The State further argued that the petition was dismissed without good cause as required by Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1116(4) (1971).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were previously convicted in the federal system of bank robbery. Their first-degree murder convictions arose from the murder of a hostage that was taken during the bank robbery. The court rejected defendants' contention that their prosecution for murder was prohibited by double jeopardy because the bank robbery offense was not the same in law and in fact as the murder offense and their first-degree murder convictions required an element of premeditated design that was not required for their bank robbery convictions. The court found that the State was not under the burden of negating any and all possibility of evidence tampering. The brief period when one defendant's car was left unlocked and unattended went to the weight rather than the admissibility of the evidence found inside it. The trial court's admission of a photograph of the victim's body at the scene of the homicide was within its discretion because it was probative and aided the jury in corroborating testimony. The court affirmed defendants' convictions, modified their sentences to life imprisonment because the jury had no discretion in rendering the mandatory sentence, and affirmed their sentences as modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death, he asserted on appeal that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss his case after the original trial was continued and a mistrial declared because he was denied his right to a speedy trial. The court noted that Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 817 (1971), provided that a dismissal under Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 812 was not a bar to any other prosecution for the same offense. The court therefore held that &sect; 812 was not a speedy trial statute. Defendant also asserted that the trial court erred in failing to sustain his motion for new trial on grounds of misconduct of a juror, who failed to reveal during voir dire that his father was murdered when the juror was a young child. The court held that the trial court did not err in finding that there was no bias of the juror and no prejudice to defendant and in denying the motion for new trial. The court affirmed the judgment but modified the sentence to life imprisonment at hard labor. The court noted that the United States Supreme Court had held that Oklahoma's statutory scheme in reference to the death penalty was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contented that lewdness may be in the eye of the beholder i.e., what seemed to be a compassionate and loving hug to one party may be an obscene action to another. The court rejected this argument finding that there was a night and day distinction between acts of compassion and those motivated by wanton salacity, a distinction which the reasonable person could not confuse. The court also held that there was no evidence supportive of giving the lesser included charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction by holding that sufficient circumstantial evidence at a preliminary hearing established the corpus delicti of injury of a minor child to permit the admission of defendant's confession. The State properly sought conviction under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 843, which was not unconstitutionally vague and intended to more severely punish child batterers.

The court first rejected defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. Premeditation was shown by evidence that defendant threatened the victim's life, that he had a gun in his possession, and that he pointed it at the victim on two occasions, the last time being a moment before the shooting. The court also held that defendant was not entitled to instructions on the lesser included offenses of second degree murder and manslaughter because defendant's testimony was consistent with only the theory that he did not kill the deceased, and neither the State nor defendant introduced evidence that tended to prove a reduced degree of homicide. The court also held that the trial court had not committed reversible error in selecting jurors during voir dire. Defendant's conviction was affirmed. However, the statute under which defendant had been convicted, which imposed a mandatory death penalty, was declared unconstitutional after defendant's conviction. Therefore defendant's sentence was modified to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, as modified to reduce the sentence to life imprisonment. The court first held that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to excuse jurors who stated during voir dire that they had formed opinions of the case. The jurors, who learned of the case through the news media, indicated that they were able to impartially consider the matters at issue, and so were competent, under Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 662. The court also found that the denial of defendant's change of venue request was not an abuse of discretion; defendant was not prevented from receiving a fair trial by an impartial jury. Further, the testimony by defendant's ballistics expert properly was excluded because the gun employed in the tests was two inches longer than the one used by defendant. Finally, the court modified the death sentences because the death penalty was prohibited in cases in which the jury had no discretion regarding imposition of the penalty. The death penalty was mandatory under the first-degree murder statute, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.3 (Supp. 1974).</SPAN></P>

Further, there was positive testimony that the informant's comment did not relate to sex, prostitution, or anything involved in the investigation. The record, which indicated that defendant asked the officers what they would like, quoted a list of available acts and the expenses of each act and entered a bedroom with one of them and started to undress, supported the verdict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner alleged that the statutory homicide murder scheme under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.1 et seq. was unconstitutional because the U.S. Supreme Court, in declaring the death penalty unconstitutional, left the statutory scheme without an expressed penalty provision for violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.1, which was the first degree murder provision. The court had to determine the status of those defendants either charged with or convicted of murder prior to the effective date of the new revised murder statutes. The new murder statute could not be applied retroactively by judicial construction under the Ex Post Facto Clause. The court found that the remaining provisions of the prior homicide murder statute remained in effect after the striking of the death penalty provision. The legislative intent was to give effect to the severability clause in the statutory scheme because a constitutionally permissible penalty remained. The appropriate penalty for murder in the first degree was life in the penitentiary at hard labor. As to murder in the second degree, the court found that the only constitutional sentence was mandatory punishment of 10 years to life.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus, defendant argued that recent United States Supreme Court decisions had rendered Oklahoma's homicide murder statute,&nbsp;Okla.

The court found that the United States Supreme Court had not declared Oklahoma's homicide murder statutes unconstitutional, but, merely had stricken the death penalty provision, Okla.

The court determined that even a cursory examination of the affidavit for the search warrant demonstrated that it established probable cause. The warrant described with particularity the premises to be searched and the contraband sought to be seized. Further, the court found no error in the trial court's admission of a detective's testimony regarding the street value of marijuana and the amount that could be consumed by a normal user. That was properly admissible to show defendant's intent to distribute. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict based on the large quantity of marijuana, wrappers, packages, and scales, which were seized during the execution of the warrant.

A security guard testified that there had been an attempted burglary the previous night, in an apartment 75 feet from where he found defendant. The court did not find this to be evidence of defendant's involvement in other crimes. The court further found that any error which may have occurred in a police officer's testimony relating that defendant had been taken into custody apparently for some other crime did not constitute reversible error, and was harmless in light of the trial court's sustaining defendant's objection and admonishing the jury.</SPAN></P>

The officer performed an inventory search and found a bag of marijuana in the glove box. Defendant was convicted for possession of marijuana. Defendant appealed and contended that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion to suppress because the safety and license check amounted to an unreasonable search and seizure. The court affirmed and held that the State had a right under Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 6-112 to make routine and reasonable driver's license checks designed to insure the safety and welfare of its citizens by assuring that only licensed drivers were on the highways. The court also held that the search was reasonable because defendant was arrested under reasonable cause. The inventory search was for the protection of defendant and his property and was incident to a valid arrest. The court also held that Okla. Stat. tit. 60, &sect; 2-402B.2, pertaining to the use of marijuana, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding, petitioner, the owner of apartment buildings with outdoor swimming pools, sought a writ of prohibition directed to respondents, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and the judge of the Municipal Court in and for Oklahoma City (Oklahoma), commanding them to desist and refrain from further proceedings in three cases requiring petitioner to install protective devices at the pools, which petitioner had appealed to a district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first considered under what conditions it had authority to issue the writ. The court considered Okla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4, Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect;&sect; 40, 41 (1971), and cases from Oklahoma and New Mexico. The import of the court's inquiry was that a writ of prohibition could be issued only from a superior court to an inferior court, and a court was inferior when it had been placed under the supervisory or appellate control of the superior court. The court assumed, without deciding, that Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 958.14 (1971) authorized a defendant to appeal a conviction from a municipal court, and that &sect; 958.14, under which petitioner appealed his convictions, was constitutional. The court then considered whether petitioner's appeal could be taken to the court. There was no statutory authority for such appeal. Petitioner's appeal to the district court under &sect; 958.14 was final. Thus, the court exercised no appellate jurisdiction over the district court in petitioner's three cases then pending before the district court. The relationship of superior and inferior did not exist between the court and the district court, so the court had no authority to issue a writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the writ.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the burglary instructions given by the trial court were broader than the information under which he was charged. He further contended that the trial court erred in refusing to give an instruction on the lesser-included offense of breaking and entering. The court noted that there was essentially no transcript of the evidence presented at trial. An examination of the instructions complained of revealed that they were simply a restatement of the statute under which defendant was charged and were not erroneous on their face. With no evidence or record to review, the court could not say that the trial court erred in giving the instructions complained of or in failing to instruct on the lesser-included offense. As to defendant's contention that Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1435 (1971) was unconstitutional for the reason that it implied that anyone who committed a breaking and entering was guilty of burglary in the second degree, the court was unable to determine without a transcript whether the State presented sufficient evidence to prove the material elements of the crime charged.</SPAN></P>

Regarding defendant's argument that the portion of &sect; 2-401 that prohibited deferred or suspended sentences in cases of violation of &sect; 2-401 was unconstitutional, the court held that the argument had become moot, given the court's assumption that the case sub judice involved defendant's first conviction for a violation of &sect; 2-401. Under a recent statutory amendment, the trial court, at the time of the appeal, had authority to consider defendant for a deferred or suspended sentence, and defendant could seek relief under the recent amendment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the District Court, Tulsa County (Oklahoma) of assault with a deadly weapon after former conviction of a felony. He was sentenced to a term of 199 years' imprisonment. On appeal, the issues included whether defendant's conviction when he was 15 years old, which was later ruled constitutionally invalid, tainted several later convictions considered by the jury in assessing his punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The early conviction was ruled invalid because the then-applicable juvenile certification statute had been held to have been discriminatorily applied. On appeal, the court pointed out that the problem of convictions purportedly incurred during the effective period of such juvenile statutes had been resolved by the court in an earlier decision, so the cases relied upon by defendant had no merit. Further, the only evidence before the court indicated that, as to the earlier conviction, defendant was properly ordered for prosecution under a valid statute. There were no facts before the court upon which to conclude that the earlier conviction had been invalid. The court pointed out that the proceeding at bar was not the proper forum for collaterally attacking the earlier conviction. Finally, the court held that, given that defendant had four other convictions after the first one, any taint caused by the first one was harmless error. But, the prosecutor's closing argument, although not in bad faith, made reference to the pardon and parole policy of the State in such a way as to contribute to defendant's sentence. Therefore, the court modified the sentence to a term of 75 years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The district judge contended the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-401 (Supp. 1975) vested him with jurisdiction to entertain the defendant's application. The court granted the writ of prohibition, holding that the Legislature never intended the act to vest in the district court the right to entertain jurisdiction in a case which had been affirmed on appeal and the judgment and sentence served and satisfied, and if it had, it would have constituted an unconstitutional infringement upon the powers of the Chief Executive of the State of Oklahoma and the Pardon and Parole Board.

The State filed a motion to dismiss charges against defendants for possession of heroin because there was insufficient evidence to prosecute absent the fruits of the illegal search and seizure.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Furman, the Oklahoma legislature had eliminated sentencing discretion for the crime of first degree murder by making the death penalty mandatory upon conviction. In &sect;&sect; 701.5 and 701.6 (1974), the legislature further granted to the court, upon appellate review, the authority to modify a death sentence to life imprisonment when the death sentence was discriminatory or disproportionate. The court concluded, however, that &sect;&sect; 701.5 and 701.6 failed to provide standards for determining whether a death sentence was disproportionate, and, in the event that a death sentence was discriminatory, the proper remedy would be a new trial. The court therefore held that &sect;&sect; 701.5 and 701.6 were unconstitutional. However, the severability clause enacted along with the bill adopting Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.1 et seq. (1974) could be invoked to sever the unconstitutional provisions from the remaining portions of the enactment. Defendants' death sentence were properly imposed pursuant to the remaining statutory scheme. Furthermore, the court's decision did not operate as an ex post facto law against defendants nor deny them due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision previously entered was reaffirmed, and the previous order of the court staying execution of sentence pending appeal was set aside. A date was set for defendants' execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court, Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), in which he was convicted and sentenced for the offense of first degree murder, in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.1(9) (Supp. 1974). In accordance with the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.3 (Supp. 1974), defendant was sentenced to suffer death. Defendant contended on appeal that the death sentence was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After he left a motel, defendant was seen picking up a 13-year-old boy for a ride to the bus station. The boy's partially burned body was later found in the motel, along with defendant's partially burned wallet. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his application for an order committing him for mental observation and examination. The court found that the unsworn and inconclusive representations of defense counsel as to defendant's sanity were refuted by the prosecutor's own observations. The court also found that the voir dire examination was proper, as the veniremen who were excused responded affirmatively that they could not inflict the death penalty. In affirming, the court held that the scheme for enforcement of capital punishment under the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.1 did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. As this was the first decision to discuss the constitutionality of a conviction under &sect; 701.1, the court held that the classification of the offense by the Legislature was a reasonable exercise of its police power as the imposition of capital punishment served to deter such brutal offenses against children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment and sentence of the District Court, Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which convicted him of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, after former conviction of the same offense, in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 11-902 (1971), and fixed punishment at three years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was charged by information with the offense, an order of admission to hospital was filed declaring defendant mentally ill. Within a month, defendant was discharged from the hospital and a certificate of restoration was filed declaring the defendant restored to soundness of mind. The jury found defendant guilty as charged. The trial court overruled defendant's motion to set aside the verdict by reason of insanity. On appeal, defendant argued that the certificate of restoration was not valid because of the unconstitutionality of Okla. Stat. tit. 43A, &sect; 75 (1971) of the Mental Health Act. Therefore, he was insane at the time of the trial based on the order of admission to the hospital, which, he argued, was still in effect. The court found defendant's contention was without merit. First, it was not supported by any authority. Second, the determination of mental incompetency in criminal proceedings and in civil proceedings was governed by separate provisions. A determination in a civil proceeding of mental illness was not binding in a criminal court. The issue of insanity had to be raised at the trial court in relation to the criminal charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial on the robbery by fear charge, employees of a store testified that defendant went to a check cashing booth at the store and gave the manager a note that stated that it was a robbery and that he had a gun in his pants. The store manager gave defendant $ 1,150, and defendant shoved the money into his pants and walked out. The employees all positively identified defendant in photo lineups and in court. The prosecutor was allowed to present evidence of defendant's prior past felony, including a conviction when defendant was 17 years old. The prosecutor, during closing argument, delineated the various sentences that defendant had received and urged the jury to give defendant a 206-year sentence. The jury found defendant guilty as charged and returned a 201-year prison verdict. The court affirmed the conviction but modified the sentence downward to 60 years, holding that the failure to certify defendant as an adult during the first conviction did not render that conviction void for habitual offender evidentiary purposes. The prosecutor's comments amounted to an improper comment on the possibility of parole, however, the evidence of guilt was overwhelming.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the District Court of Cleveland County (Oklahoma), which convicted him on a guilty plea of unlawful delivery of marihuana, in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-401 (1971), and sentenced him to two years in prison and a fine of $ 1.00. The trial court denied defendant's motion to withdraw his plea of guilty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the imposition of judgment and sentence in his case was to be indefinitely postponed if his pre-sentence investigation report favored probation, even though &sect; 2-401 then prohibited suspended, deferred, or probationary sentences. The court opined that the claim was contradicted by the record, which showed that defendant was a 23-year-old university senior of above average intelligence, who knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently pleaded guilty after a lengthy, sworn examination by defense counsel, the prosecutor, and the trial court. Further, the delay in imposing sentence did not cause the trial court to lose jurisdiction. Finally, the court noted that &sect; 2-401 was amended after defendant's conviction, which mooted defendant's claims that it was unconstitutional. The amended statute excepted first offenders from the prohibition against suspended and deferred sentences. Thus, assuming defendant was not later convicted of another offense of &sect; 2-401, the court concluded that he was eligible to apply to the trial court to vacate the sentence and defer sentencing, or to suspend the execution of the judgment and sentence.</SPAN></P>

Several witnesses observed defendant's car in the vicinity of the crime at the time of the crime. Defendant was read his Miranda rights, waived his right to an attorney, and voluntarily confessed to the murder after talking to his father and his wife. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motions for a continuance and a change of venue, in admitting defendant's confession, in empaneling the jury, in admitting demonstrative evidence, in charging the jury, and in permitting certain prosecutorial comments. The court held that defendant's confession was admissible because defendant voluntarily waived his Miranda rights and voluntarily confessed. The court reversed its holdings in Reese and Schorr insofar as they conflicted with the court's ruling and adopted the reasoning of Wright v. North Carolina, relative to defendant's waiver of his Miranda rights.

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.1(2) (Supp. 1974). In accordance with the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.3 (Supp. 1974), the death penalty was imposed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree for the shooting death of a cab driver in the course of a robbery. Defendant first contended that the death sentence was unconstitutional by virtue of federal case law. The argument had already been thoroughly analyzed and rejected by the court in an unrelated case. In his final assignment of error defendant contends that the death penalty could not be imposed because five veniremen were improperly excused for cause in violation of Witherspoon. The court determined that applicability of the federal case was limited to those cases where, upon conviction for the offense charged, the jury has discretion to resolve whether a defendant suffered death or some lesser degree of punishment. The provisions under which defendant was convicted, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.1 et seq., (1974) made the assessment of the death penalty mandatory upon conviction for first degree murder. The appropriate basis for exclusion for cause of jurors antagonistic to capital punishment in defendant's case was for implied bias or actual bias to the extent that the personal scruples or opinions of a venireman would not yield to the law. No error was found.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the in-court identification of defendant by a deputy was inadmissible because it was tainted by pre-trial identifications. Error, if any, was cured by defense counsel's trial stipulation and defendant's similar testimony that defendant was the individual who sold the marijuana to the deputy, which were made in support an entrapment defense. The claim of entrapment was frivolous. Officers merely told defendant that they would like to buy some marijuana, to which defendant readily assented without any pressure or undue influence. The State was not barred from maintaining the prosecution because the case was twice dismissed at preliminary hearing. The dismissal orders were made before the introduction of any evidence, and were made because of the nonappearance of witnesses. They were not &quot;adverse&quot; rulings on the merits of the State's evidence so as to bar prosecution for failure to comply with Okla. Ct. Crim. App. R. 6, Okla. Stat. tit. 22, ch. 18, app. (1971). Neither would subsequent refiling under those facts constitute double jeopardy, denial of due process, or denial of speedy trial in view of Okla.

The court further found that neither witness wavered during cross-examination and each stated that he immediately recognized defendant at the lineup and recognized defendant's photographs because of independent recollection of defendant during the robbery.

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.1 (2) (1974), and, in accordance with the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.3 (1974), imposed the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant initially contended that the death sentence was unconstitutional. However, the court noted that it had rejected such a claim in another case. Defendant also claimed that the death penalty could not be imposed because five veniremen were improperly excused for cause. The court rejected this claim. The court held that defendant's contention only applied when the jury had discretion as to whether to impose the death penalty, and under Oklahoma law, when a defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, the jury was required to impose the death penalty. Furthermore, according to the court, the State was entitled to dismissal for cause of a juror who announced that, because of his personal beliefs, he could not follow the law. The court concluded that the veniremen had been properly excused for cause and affirmed the district court's judgment to the extent that it found that the record was free of any error of law requiring reversal or modification.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed their convictions, arguing that they were improperly tried and that the death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that the trial court did not err in excluding veniremen for cause because they expressed conscientious or religious scruples against imposing the death penalty because the veniremen refused to be fair and impartial and would not impose the law as given by the trial court. The court also determined that one of the defendants' confessions was correctly admitted into trial because it was voluntarily made and was not produced by threats, mistreatment, or promises. Further, the court stated that the State's imposition of the death penalty did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amends.

They appealed, claiming that they were denied due process of law by virtue of the statutory presumption contained in an instruction to the jury as to Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect;&sect; 1728, 1729 (1971). The court reversed and remanded. The court found that there was no reasonable connection between the possession of the copper wire, cable, or tubing, the fact proved, and knowledge that the copper products were stolen, the fact presumed, in the absence of some evidence to the contrary; therefore, such presumption was arbitrary. It was a question for the jury as to whether defendants' explanation of possession was to be believed. However, to place upon defendants the burden of a presumption of guilt and require an affirmative defense destroyed the constitutional presumption of innocence until proven guilty. Therefore, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1729 (1971) was unconstitutional in that it violated the due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Okla. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court assumed original jurisdiction and denied petitioner's writ. The court found that Okla. Const. art.

However, while recognizing petitioner's right to both a jury trial and its waiver, the court determined that the State, too, was entitled to a trial by jury in a criminal case. The court noted that the State constitution contemplated that, in order for a waiver to be effective, all parties should waive the right to have issues of fact determined by a jury. The court held that, before any waiver of a jury trial by petitioner could become effective, the State's consent and the sanction of the trial court was required. The court failed to see how compelling petitioner to submit to a jury trial prejudiced him, deprived him his right to a fair trial, or deprived him of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute under which defendant was convicted was constitutionally sound and that no substantial right of defendant was violated by the application of the standards for judging obscenity.

This was not the law. The State was required to show by introduction of the material itself that acts of sexual intercourse or unnatural copulation were depicted in a patently offensive way and that the material offended the standards of obscenity. The district attorney during closing argument made improper and inflammatory comments beyond the bounds of reasonableness.

On appeal, the issues included whether the trial court should have treated &sect; 1040.51 as an obscenity statute thereby requiring application of the standards established by the United State Supreme Court in A Book v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants operated a store through which a person could purchase print materials and movies. The charges arose out of an undercover operation. On appeal, the court noted that, despite the trial court's recognition of the nature of the materials sold, it was obvious the trial court had not considered &sect; 1040.51 to be an obscenity statute and thus did not apply the Supreme Court standards. Based on a recent decision of the court, the trial court had to apply those standards and it was reversible error not to have done so. But, the court had also held in that case that &sect; 1040.51 met the constitutional standards established by Miller v. California and its companion cases. The retroactive application of Miller did not violate the constitutional ex post facto law proscription and defendants' claims of vagueness and lack of fair notice also failed. Further, &sect; 1040.51 had always met the requirements of notice and due process in sufficiently defining that material which was proscribed by the statute. Given that the materials at issue were obtained by purchase, no preliminary adversary hearing was required either to determine the issue of obscenity or as a predicate for defendants' arrests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma) of the offense of the sale of a magazine showing acts of sexual intercourse in violation of Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An agent for the Oklahoma Crime Bureau testified that he purchased an allegedly obscene magazine from defendant, who was working at an adult bookstore. The magazine contained explicit photographs of persons engaged in sexual intercourse. Defendant called three witnesses. One testified that many volumes of sexually explicit material were sold in the Tulsa area, and other two testified that they did not object to the content of the magazine or to its availability to adults who wished to purchase it. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and rejected his attack on the constitutionality of the statute. The court noted that the issue of the statute's constitutionality had been previously decided. The magazine was properly introduced into evidence. No prior adversary hearing was required because the magazine was purchased rather than seized. The court modified defendant's sentence and held that the prosecutor's comments regarding the effect on children of being exposed to obscene material, where there was no evidence that any children had been exposed to such material, served to inflame the passions and prejudices of the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed an application for habeas corpus, alleging that trial court erred in failing to certify him as an adult to stand trial on charges of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, robbery with a dangerous weapon, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and rape in the first degree. According to defendant, the trial court's failure to do so rendered his convictions void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his application for habeas corpus, defendant alleged that he was between the ages of 16 and 18 when he committed his crimes and that the trial court's failure to certify him to stand trial as an adult rendered his convictions void. Defendant premised his argument upon two decisions of federal district courts. In denying defendant's application, the court noted that it was not bound by decisions of the inferior federal courts and that it, along with the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma, had authority to interpret the state constitution and statutes. After reviewing Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1101(a) (Supp. 1969), which treated females as adults at age 18 and males as adults at age 16, the court concluded that the statute was unconstitutionally discriminatory between the genders in defining &quot;delinquent child.&quot; As such, the prior statute was controlling as to the definition. Under Okla. Comp. Laws ch. 13, art. I, &sect; 594 (1909), a delinquent child was any child, regardless of gender, under the age of 16 who violated the law. Because defendant was above the age of 16 at the time of his convictions, it was unnecessary to certify him as an adult to stand trial.</SPAN></P>

It included sexually explicit photos, which the jury viewed. In affirming defendant's conviction the court first held that Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1040.51, was not unconstitutional. The court also held that the application of the Miller standards to the statute did not make obscene material which previously was not. The court held that Miller only added to obscenity statutes a &quot;clarifying gloss&quot; that served to define obscenity more specifically and remove doubt about the vagueness or overbreadth of these statutes. The court then held that because the magazine was not seized, but was purchased, a prior adversary hearing regarding obscenity was not required. The court also held that the State was not required to present evidence of the Miller standards to make a prima facie case, noting that the introduction of the allegedly obscene material and submission of the same to the jury was sufficient. The court held that the prosecutor transgressed in relating defendant's conduct to drug trafficking and organized crime where no evidence of this connection appeared of record, but held that this evidence only enhanced the punishment.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the provisions of Okla.

However, the court found that the district court failed to properly instruct the jury concerning the standards and definitions set on in the post-Miller decision; therefore, the court ordered the judgment reversed and remanded for new trial under proper instruction.</SPAN></P>

Prior to the transfer, defendant filed a motion to vacate the transfer order. Defendant filed a motion seeking bail and change of venue. The motion to change venue was sustained and the case was transferred to a fourth district. Here, the court found that the original change of trial venue, in so far as defendant's motion for change of venue, was correct. As to the other defendants, the court held that the change of trial venue was in violation of Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 20 and Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 561 (1971). The court held that the second transfer of venue, after the mistrial was declared, was void. The court ordered that the records in the case should be transferred to the original transfer district.

Defendant then filed an application to the court to assume jurisdiction and enter an order permanently prohibiting the district court from further proceedings. The court granted the application. The court found that the orders dismissing the informations were final and that the district court was without jurisdiction thereafter to attempt to vacate such orders, even though they may have been based on an erroneous interpretation of law. The court relied on Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 508 (1971) in its decision. The court then held that Okla.

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1283 (1971) and sentenced him to five years of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State and defendant stipulated that he was arrested for being drunk in public while getting into a vehicle and that the arresting officer observed a gun on the floorboard in the vehicle. The overall length of the gun was 32 and 1/4 inches and the barrel measured 28 inches. Defendant contended that the firearm found in his possession was not a restricted firearm contemplated within the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1283 (1971). The court noted that the firearm in defendant's possession did not constitute a sawed-off shotgun as prohibited by &sect; 1283, but that a sawed-off shotgun was not the only firearm prohibited by &sect; 1283. The evidence of the shortened stock and overall length was sufficient to place within the province of the jury the question of whether the firearm could have been as easily concealed as a sawed-off shotgun. The court would not disturb the factual finding of the jury that the firearm was prohibited under the provisions of &sect; 1283. The language of the statute was not unconstitutionally vague but rather clearly set forth that a weapon which might be as easily concealed as a sawed-off shotgun was a prohibited firearm.</SPAN></P>

Regarding the sentence imposed on defendant, the court found that it met the statutory limitation and that it was not excessive. This determination re excessiveness was made, per the court, partly on the basis of the overpowering evidence of guilt. Defendant argued that a search warrant issued for his mother's residence was unconstitutional; regarding this, the court found that no evidence obtained from the search was introduced and no information procured from that search was in any manner utilized against defendant and that thus it was not required that the court rule on this argument.

The court ruled that the punishment assessed was well within the limitations provided by tit. 47, &sect; 11-902 and that generally a sentence imposed within the limitations provided in a statute would not constitute &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; as contemplated by either the U.S. or Oklahoma Constitution.

On review, the court found that there was no error in forcing the jury to stay in deliberation until 3 a.m., that the rule of sequestration of witnesses was within the trial court's discretion, that opening statements by the prosecution were not prejudicial, that defendant did not object to in-court identification by the witnesses, and that the lineup and photographic identifications preceded the formal charge and were not prejudicial.

The court held that the instruction was a clear statement of the law and that the term &quot;prima facie evidence&quot; did not shift the burden of proof from the State to defendant. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of other bogus checks written on the same date. The court held that the evidence was relevant and was clearly admissible for the purpose of proving guilty knowledge or intent. Finally, defendant argued that her conviction was improper because she had established the defense of coverture. The court affirmed the judgment.

The court held that where an appeal was taken by an accused from a judgment entered upon a plea of guilty, the appeal would ordinarily present only such questions as to go to the free and voluntary character of the plea, or that accused was not of competent intelligence, or was not advised of his legal rights and the nature and consequences of his plea, or as to the sufficiency of the indictment or information to confer jurisdiction, or the legality of the sentence.

The court found that its prior opinion in this case holding defendant's challenge to the legality of the search without merit was compatible with recent decisions of the Supreme Court. The materials were found and seized at a place in which defendant maintained no possessory interest. The occupant of the premises permitted the search and thereby waived his Fourth Amendment rights. Defendant had raised an issue concerning the expert witnesses presented by the State. After consideration of recent Supreme Court cases, the court found its original opinion to be consistent with those decisions. The court cited cases in which it was held that, although both the State and the prosecution could present expert testimony in an obscenity case, it was not a mandatory prerequisite to establishing a prima facie case under an obscenity statute. The court therefore expressly overruled its holding in Ramirez v. State, Okl. Cr., 430 P.2d 826, concerning the necessity of ancillary evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a valid search warrant issued upon a determination of probable obscenity by the magistrate satisfied the requirement of a procedure designed to focus searchingly upon the question of obscenity such that preliminary hearing was not required. The court then agreed with the State's contention that Okla.

He argued that the ordinance was overbroad and on its face violated the guarantee of freedom of expression provided under U.S. Const. amend. I. The court ruled that the ordinance ran afoul of the overbreadth doctrine. The language proscribed did not have to be loud, boisterous, or uttered in a public place. There was no requirement that the speaker have knowledge that someone within hearing might be offended. The ordinance could not be rendered acceptable through application of the rules of statutory construction because it was simply too broadly worded. It was not susceptible to an appropriately narrow interpretation. The court rejected the city's argument that the ordinance was similar to a state statute that outlawed fighting words. The ordinance was more punitive than the statute so that if they were directed at the same thing the ordinance was invalid.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. IV, &sect; 1, was in violation of the equal protection clause and due process clause, and further constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court disagreed.

The court affirmed the district court's judgment as modified to reduce defendant's sentence to three years, concluding that defendant's role in the offense and his testifying for the State at the co-defendant's trial and the co-defendant's sentence justified reducing defendant's sentence. The court reasoned that the district court ordered the State to provide defendant with the relevant available documents and that the State's failure to timely inform defendant that no recording of his confession existed was not reversible error. The court also held that &sect; 264 was not unconstitutionally vague because a person of reasonable intelligence could have understood what it prohibited.

The court held that there were essential differences between the making of an oral statement and the taking of a chemical test which made the giving of warnings precisely analogous to those set down in Miranda neither necessary nor practicable. Defendant consented to take that test only after the arresting officer had: 1) read to him the Miranda warnings; 2) ascertained that he understood those warnings; 3) told him he was under arrest for driving while under the influence of intoxicants and fully informed him of his rights regarding taking of the chemical test, including his right to refuse to take either a blood test or a breathalyzer test. This procedure protected defendant's privilege under Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 21. Also, Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to suppress the evidence on the reasoning that his privilege against self-incrimination was violated. The district court determined defendant's blood alcohol results were illegally obtained because defendant was not advised of his right to counsel prior to, or during the administration of the test. Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the breath test was suppressed and the case was dismissed for want of sufficient evidence. The court stated that it was apparent the Sixth Amendment did not give rise to a right to be informed of his right to counsel prior to having the blood alcohol test administered. Defendant was not entitled to be advised of a right to counsel prior to being administered the blood alcohol test. It was further contended that the district court erred in dismissing the case upon the sustaining of its motion to suppress as there was still sufficient evidence excluding the blood alcohol content results to hold defendant for trial. The court agreed, but because the State appealed the case on a reserve question of law the district court's order of dismissal was final.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's arrest was valid because the offense was committed in the presence of the police officers and the evidence seized was in their view. The court found that there was no constitutional requirement that the arrest for a violation of obscenity laws be conducted in a different manner than other offenses.

Defendants were 15 years of age and were certified for criminal prosecution as adults pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1112 (1971).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the juvenile court waived its jurisdiction and certified defendants for prosecution only after a full hearing, assisted by counsel, with the right of confrontation, with testimony by witnesses for the State and the juveniles, and with proper notice to the parents prior to the hearing. The juvenile court reviewed the extensive records of defendants in their prior contacts with the juvenile court and did not act until it had the benefit of a psychiatric evaluation. The court concluded that the juvenile court's reasons for its rulings and findings were stated in the record and supported by the evidence. Thus, its waiver and certification satisfied due process requirements. In the court's view, the waiver and certification was not in error without evidence of defendants' emotional maturity beyond their chronological age because an advanced emotional maturity was not a statutory criteria for certification. The court found some validity to defendants' assertion that the statute was lacking meaningful guidelines, but did not find the statute so void of standards as to render it unconstitutional. The court adopted standards for use by juvenile courts in the future.</SPAN></P>

The court so held based on its finding that, under Okla.

The court affirmed. First, the court held that the question of the exclusion of jurors for cause based upon their scruples against the death penalty was rendered moot by the fact that defendant received a sentence of 99 years' imprisonment. Second, the court held that under Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 927 (1972), the trial court had the authority to impose sentence if the jury could not agree on the punishment. The record showed that the jury was instructed to continue their deliberation as required by statute. Third, the court held that defendant's sentence was not excessive given the nature of the offense. The sentence was within the statutory range. Fourth, the court held that permitting introduction of more than one previous conviction to establish the &quot;after former&quot; accusation was not reversible error.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, who had been convicted of violating the statute, asserted that it contained an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority in the portion of the statute that excepted motion pictures that obtained a seal of approval from a privately-controlled, out-of-state motion picture association. The court affirmed. The statute was unconstitutional because it lacked narrowly drawn, reasonable, and definite standards to govern the motion picture association or the U.S. Customs Office and provided for no hearings or review. The portion of &sect; 1040.51 in which the legislature delegated censorship power to an association wholly outside the jurisdiction of the State of Oklahoma without establishing some standards for guidance was declared invalid.

The question was not a definition of reasonable doubt, nor was it an instruction on reasonable doubt. As such, it was not prejudicial to defendant. His right to a fair trial also was not prejudiced by the State's cross-examination of a character witness, a minister, because the asserted error was not properly preserved due to defendant's failure to object to the cross-examination. Further, had the alleged error been preserved, the questions asked were proper because a witness testifying to the good reputation or character of a defendant could be cross-examined with respect to rumors or reports of particular acts imputed to the defendant and as to what the witness had heard of specific charges of misconduct made against the defendant.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 37, &sect; 537(e) (1971), attempted to bind operators of cafes, restaurants, clubs, or other places of recreation, regardless of whether those places traded in alcoholic beverages, while the Act purported to control operations performed upon alcoholic beverages themselves.

Each category of proscription in the Act's title went to affect persons who directly dealt in or with alcoholic beverages.

The court noted that none of the issues which were in conflict in defendant's trial shed any reasonable doubt on defendant's actually committing the offense. The court held that there was competent evidence in the record and that the jury's determination would not be disturbed. Defendant also argued that the verdict was excessive. The court noted that defendant was sentenced to serve one year in each case for a total of two years where he possibly could have received five years for each offense. The court upheld the verdict because it was clearly within the range provided by law and was not excessive. The court affirmed the judgment. The court rejected defendant's claim that he had been held to answer to charges the prosecution of which constituted a violation of the principle of former jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Griswold allowed states to regulate sexual promiscuity and misconduct. The court also found that the placement of prisoners was an administrative and not a judicial act and the state legislature had the right to provide prisons and determine where prisoners were to be confined. Therefore defendant had no constitutional right to have facilities provided for him that would rehabilitate his conduct and personality.

Defendant perfected a timely writ of certiorari to the court to challenge his sentence. He argued &sect; 2-401(B)(2) was unconstitutional because the legislature exceeded its constitutionally limited powers by invading the judicial domain and the denial of the possibility of probation constituted cruel and unusual punishment and violates due process and equal protection of the laws. The court found the legislature properly exercised its power to prohibit suspension of a sentence as an inherent part of its power to prescribe punishment for the acts which it prohibited as criminal. Moreover, the legislative history of &sect; 2-401(B)(2) showed the reasoning behind the prohibition was not to impose cruel and unusual punishment.

They contended that the Oklahoma Obscenity Statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1040.12 (1971), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consolidated cases involved the sale of 14 alleged obscene materials to adults. Defendants alleged that the obscenity statute was unconstitutional because there was no procedure for an adversary hearing on obscenity prior to seizure of the materials. On appeal, the court noted that none of the exhibits were seized and that there was a significant distinction between seizing a magazine and merely obtaining a copy as evidence of a criminal offense. Thus, no adversary hearing was required. The court held that the statute was constitutional, even though it did not incorporate obscenity elements set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court, i.e., lack of redeeming social value and a national contemporary community standard, because those elements were implied. The statute was not required to recite a concern for the welfare of certain classes of people, such as juveniles. The court noted that defendants' bookstore was posted &quot;Adults Only,&quot; which warranted an inference that defendants were aware of what the magazines contained and proved scienter. However, of the 14 challenged materials, only one magazine that overtly depicted a sexual act between two males was adjudged obscene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court on the possession of one obscene magazine. The court reversed the trial court judgments on the other 13 materials.</SPAN></P>

Defendant produced a white powdery substance that he claimed to have been &quot;coke,&quot; placed a portion in a small sheet of aluminum foil and sold it to the officers. There was a further conversation about future purchases of hashish or heroin from defendant. One officer testified that a second purchase of cocaine from defendant had been made. The other officer testified that he knew that the informant had been a drug user, who after his arrest decided to work with the police. Defendant testified that he was a high school senior who knew the informant for approximately one year. Defendant claimed that the informant pleaded with defendant to acquire either heroin or cocaine. Defendant claimed to have nothing to do with the sale of drugs, but eventually relented and made the sale to the informant and officers. The court affirmed and rejected defendant's assertion that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss for reason of entrapment. The court held that entrapment could not be decided as a matter of law, and the issue was properly submitted and decided by the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of a trial court (Oklahoma) convicting him of driving an automobile which did not bear a current official inspection sticker in violation of Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, &sect; 851. Defendant contended that the Motor Vehicle Inspection Act, Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, &sect; 851 to 861, was unconstitutional because it deprived him of due process of law and violated the governmental separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that the Act was unconstitutional because it denied him due process of law under Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 7, and violated the constitutional provision for separation of power contained in Okla. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. Defendant claimed that the standard of workable and safe equipment was to vague to provide real guidelines for an inspection and that giving the Commissioner of Public Safety the power to test was an unlimited delegation of legislative power to the executive branch. He also claimed that the purpose of the Act was to avoid the loss of federal funds, and that fleet owners were treated differently under the Act. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the Act was constitutional. The court reasoned that the same standards of workable and safe equipment contained throughout other provisions of state motor vehicle equipment law were per se violations, regardless of the inspection required under the Act. The court found that the legislature had the power to regulate the operation of vehicles, provide rules for inspections that applied to different classes of car owners, and its motive for passing legislation was not subject to review.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that only one juror claimed to have detected the odor of alcohol on another juror, and that the trial court had observed nothing about the juror's manner to suggest he was intoxicated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence admitted in his trial was obtained by an unlawful search. The court decided that defendant's motion to suppress the evidence of the car search was properly denied because the search of a motor vehicle that was occupied by defendant was justified where a police officer saw a firearm in the hand of an occupant of the vehicle. Defendant contended that the trial court should have granted a mistrial when the State during its closing argument mentioned that a police officer was shot. Defense counsel objected to the comment and the trial court admonished the jury not to consider the comment. The court agreed with the trial court that the comment was improper because it was a matter outside the evidence in the case. The court determined that there was no reversible error where the evidence of defendant's guilt was conclusive and where there was no evidence to refute guilt. Defendant contended that Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1283 (1971) was unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection. The court ruled that Okla.

The right of the State to regulate sexual promiscuity and sexual misconduct between non-married persons was far superior to defendant's right to express sexual unity by performing an unnatural sex act with a young male child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The date of the alleged offense was March 28, 1972, and on that date, the defendant, a female, was 17 years old. The previous statutory scheme fixing the ages at which males and females were held to be competent to stand trial as adults had been ruled unconstitutional prior to the commission of the offense. The legislature had since amended Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1101 (1971) to provide that all persons who were not yet 18 at the time they committed an offense were entitled to a competency hearing before they could be tried as an adult. In denying the petition the court held that the amendment to &sect; 1101 was not retroactive. That left only two statutes,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 152 (1971), and Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1112 (1971), bearing on the question of whether the defendant was entitled to a hearing. In concluding the defendant was not, the court held that a person, like the defendant, who committed a criminal act between March 16, 1972 and 4:00 p.m. on April 4, 1972, and had passed his or her 14th birthday, was presumed to be competent and no juvenile proceedings were required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's vehicle did not have a license plate light. When a police officer requested defendant to produce his driver's license, defendant reached under the front seat. A police officer observed a partially burned marijuana cigarette and found marijuana seeds. The trial court convicted defendant of possession of marijuana. The court modified and affirmed. There was no showing that the officers knew who was in the vehicle or suspected there was any contraband in the automobile. Defendant did not deny the traffic violations. By reaching under the front seat, defendant provided special circumstances that gave the necessary and probable cause to justify the officer's entry. The court found the evidence admissible. Defendant admitted having used marijuana and presented no evidence to corroborate the access others had to his automobile. The jury was properly instructed as to the manner that they were to consider defendant's testimony. The court could not consider issues that were not raised in the trial court and preserved for review. The trial court imposed the sentence and fine recommended by the jury. The court reduced defendant's sentence and fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant minor was 17 years old and was certified to stand trial as an adult for burglary. Defendant brought an original proceeding asking the court to require the district court judge to transfer his case back to the juvenile division on the ground that Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1101(a) (1968), which allowed females between the ages of 16 and 18 the benefits of juvenile court proceedings but denied the same benefits to males between the ages of 16 and 18, was unconstitutional. The court denied the writ of mandamus and held that defendant could be tried as an adult without certification under the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 152 (1910). The court held that both Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1101(a) (1968) and Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1101(A) (1970) were unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 152, although enacted in 1910, had not been repealed and remained valid until the Oklahoma Legislature enacted legislation to correct the harshness of &sect; 152, which defined adults as all persons over the age of 14.</SPAN></P>
