</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff under G.S. 7A-30 from the Court of Appeals decision, reported in 36 N.C. App. 456, 245 S.E. 2d 82 (1978), which affirmed the North Carolina Industrial Commission's opinion entered 10 February 1977.  This case was docketed and argued as Case No. 48 at the Fall Term 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eula Wood, plaintiff, instituted this action under the Workmen's Compensation Act to recover for a disease allegedly contracted in her employment with J.P. Stevens.  In her claim for compensation (NCIC Form 18), filed 5 December 1975, Miss Wood alleges that she contracted byssinosis &quot;prior to the 1st day of July, 1958, at Roanoke Rapids, Halifax [County]&quot;; that the disease was &quot;caused by regular exposure to cotton dust for approximately 48 years in spinning area&quot;; and that as a result of this disease she suffered &quot;permanent total disability from impairment of respiratory pulmonary functions&quot; beginning November 12, 1975.  Her doctor filled out page 2 of NCIC form B-1 and stated that it was his diagnostic impression that plaintiff was suffering from &quot;byssinosis Grade III [and] chronic bronchitis in a non-smoker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to plaintiff's claim the defendants (her employer and its insurance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  carrier) denied liability on the ground that the alleged occupational disease was not covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act as it existed at the time the disease was contracted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing before Deputy Commissioner Denson on 7 December 1976 the parties stipulated to the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. The legal issue of coverage should be determined before proceeding with further medical examination or hearing for the purpose of presenting factual evidence in this cause . . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. This cause shall hereafter be treated as a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. At the time of the alleged contracting of the alleged occupational disease, the parties were subject to and bound by the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. The employer-employee relationship existed between plaintiff and defendant employer at that time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In accordance with the stipulation no evidence was introduced in the case and Deputy Commissioner Denson heard the matter on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  In her opinion she took judicial notice that &quot;byssinosis is an irritation of the pulmonary air passages&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  caused by the inhalation of cotton dust&quot; and held that it was not a compensable occupational disease covered by G.S. 97-53 as it appeared in 1958.  She therefore denied plaintiff's claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff appealed to the full Commission from the denial of her claim and moved the Commission for leave to present expert medical testimony as to the meaning of the term &quot;oral or nasal cavities&quot; as used in the 1958 version of G.S. 97-53.  Plaintiff alleged that &quot;there are expert witnesses available from the field of pulmonary medicine who are of the opinion that a definition of 'oral or nasal cavities' includes pulmonary air passages and lungs when those words are assigned their normal meaning as used in the field.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 10 February 1977 the full Commission filed an &quot;opinion and award&quot; in which it denied plaintiff's motion and affirmed the ruling of Deputy Commissioner Denson.  Plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals.  In an opinion written by Judge Hedrick, Judge Brock concurring, the Court of Appeals affirmed the full Commission.  Judge Mitchell having dissented, plaintiff appealed as a matter of right to this Court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee sought review of a decision from the Industrial Commission (North Carolina), denying her worker's compensation benefits for a disabling occupational disease, byssinosis, caused by prolonged inhalation of cotton dust over 48 years of spinning cotton.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee challenged the industrial commission's decision to deny her permanent total disability compensation for an occupational disease, byssinosis, a chronic lung disease that she had developed over the course of 48 years of spinning cotton for her employer. The industrial commission denied the claim without hearing evidence, holding that as a matter of law, byssinosis was not covered by the Workman's Compensation Act (Act), N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-53(13), as it existed at the time she contracted the disease. On appeal, the court held that disablement resulting from an occupational disease must be treated the same as an injury by accident as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-52; therefore, the compensability of the employee's injury was governed by the law in effect at the time of disablement. The employee claimed the disease developed after July 1, 1971, the effective date of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-53(13); the employer claimed the disease developed under previous versions of the Act. The court reversed and remanded, ordering the industrial commission to hear evidence and make findings of fact as to the date of injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the industrial commission's decision to summarily deny the employee total permanent disability benefits and ordered a remand for the purpose of developing evidence as to which date the employee became disabled by an occupational lung disorder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant under G.S. 7A-27(a) from the judgment imposed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Long, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 10 October 1977 Session of Chatham County Superior Court.  This case was docketed and argued as Case No. 93 in the Spring Term, 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In four separate bills of indictment defendant was charged with (1) the kidnapping of Johnny Marvin Johnson, (2) the kidnapping of Suzanne Daniel Johnson, (3) crime against nature performed upon Suzanne Daniel Johnson and (4) assault with intent to rape Suzanne Daniel Johnson.  The jury found defendant guilty of all four offenses.  Evidence for the State tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About noon on Saturday, 25 September 1976, Johnny Marvin Johnson and his wife Suzanne Daniel Johnson, both over 16 years old, were fishing in the Buckhorn Dam area of Chatham County.  The Dam area was almost deserted and, except for some children fishing above the dam, they saw no other person except defendant.  Johnny testified, &quot;I first observed another person when we were fishing below the dam.  He was walking from the dam toward us and would fish every now and then.  That person was Mr. Silhan.  He had on blue jeans, a shirt, a camouflage coat and black boots.  He was wearing dark glasses.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later that afternoon the Johnsons having had little success fishing, decided to return home.  On the way to their car, which was in a parking area above the river, they passed the person they had seen fishing.  Johnny was walking ahead of Suzanne when he &quot;heard something that sounded like a person running&quot; behind him.  He turned around and saw that this man had grabbed Suzanne &quot;around the neck and had a gun pointed to her head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suzanne described the assault as follows: &quot;The man told Johnny to break open his gun and take the shells out and lay it on the ground.  Johnny was carrying a tackle box and shotgun at the time.  The man then told Johnny to go to the blue van which was parked in the parking area with the cars.  When we got to the van he told Johnny to lay down flat on his stomach on the floor of the van.  He then gave me some long rope or nylon cord and told me to tie Johnny's hands.  After I tied Johnny, the man then tied my hands, got into the driver's seat and drove a short distance away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the van came to a stop, he took off his belt and wrapped it around Johnny's legs.  He then blindfolded Johnny and put something in his mouth.  The man then covered Johnny with some&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  green clothes that were laying in the van.  Then he came over to me and pulled my T-shirt over my head.  He removed my britches, shoes, socks and underwear.  After he pulled my bra down I told him to take out my tampax if he was going to do anything.  He pulled it out and threw it out the back of the van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The man next pulled down his britches and took out his private parts and put it in my mouth.  He told me that if I didn't swallow it he would kill us.  When he reached a climax he untied my hands and told me to dress.  He released us and told us to run toward the creek and left.&quot; After getting safely away from their assailant the Johnsons drove home and immediately reported the incident to the county sheriff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Johnsons described their assailant to the police and, in accordance with their description, an SBI agent made a composite picture of the man who had assaulted Suzanne and kidnapped them.  They also provided a description of his van: blue with plaid seats, a bluish rug, a torn latch decal on the rear doors, and a North Carolina license plate with a military decal on the bumper.  Later, when shown a photographic lineup which did not include a picture of defendant Silhan, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Johnsons did not identify any of the photographs as being of their assailant.  However, at a lineup in Sanford on 4 May 1977, independently of each other, both Suzanne and Johnny Johnson identified defendant.  They also made in-court identifications of defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Wildlife Resources Commission enforcement officers who work at the Buckhorn Dam area testified that in May of 1976 they had seen a blue Chevrolet van with a Fort Bragg decal on the bumper parked in the area and that they had also seen defendant carrying a rifle and a side arm.  The van these officers saw fitted the description provided by the Johnsons, and it was eventually traced to the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was a soldier stationed at Fort Bragg, and he and his wife Connie Silhan lived in Sanford, North Carolina.  Defendant offered the following evidence which tended to establish an alibi:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day of the assault and kidnapping he was not required to be at the base.  At approximately 9:30 a.m. he and his friend Bobby Moore left his home and drove his blue van to the Economy T.V. and Appliance Company where defendant's wife worked.  There he exchanged car keys with his wife and drove her Plymouth &quot;Baracuda&quot; back&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to their home.  Defendant and Bobby Moore planned to sand Mrs. Silhan's automobile in preparation for a painting.  When the compressor which powered the sander was found to be inadequate they went to Coggin's Heating and Air Conditioning business to use a larger compressor.  They remained on the Coggin's premises from 11:00 or 11:30 a.m. until almost 5:00 p.m., when the two men returned to defendant's home.  Defendant testified that he did not drive the van again that day after leaving it with his wife at work, nor did he drive the van to Buckhorn Dam at any time on 25 September 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination defendant admitted that prior to September 1976 he had driven his van to the Buckhorn Dam area, and that he always carried his guns.  Notwithstanding, on redirect examination, defendant stated that on 25 September 1976 his pistol was not in his possession, but was at the home of his father-in-law.  Defendant's mother-in-law, Mrs. Violet Mae Wicker, corroborated this assertion by testifying, &quot;The gun was in my house in September of 1976.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's wife also corroborated his story and testified that he and Bobby Moore arrived at her place of employment on 25 September 1976 at approximately&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  9:30 a.m. At that time defendant told her he was leaving the van with her so that he could sand her car.  The van was parked on the corner outside and she could see it from where she stood at work.  About noon that day Connie Silhan and a friend drove by Coggin's, where they saw defendant working on the car.  When Connie returned to her work that afternoon the van had not been moved, and when she &quot;got off work at approximately 3:15 to 3:30&quot; she drove the van &quot;straight home.&quot; Defendant was not there, but he arrived around 4:30 or 4:45 p.m. and did not leave home again that day.  Bobby Moore also remained at defendant's house watching television, eating &quot;some sandwiches, and drinking Pepsi, Coke and things like that&quot; until 10:30 or 11:00 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bobby Moore testified that although he remembered helping defendant sand Mrs. Silhan's car, he could be no more specific about the date than to say it occurred in &quot;September of '76.&quot; However, Clyde Moore, Bobby's father, testified that on 25 September 1976 he saw defendant and his son Bobby at Economy T.V. and Appliance.  Clyde Moore was certain of the date because he was working &quot;on an odd-type dryer&quot; that day and had checked his records to verify&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the date.  He further testified that defendant did indeed leave the blue van with Mrs. Silhan at work and that no one could have moved the van prior to Mrs. Silhan's departure, because it was impossible to back out the van.  &quot;She was [only] able to drive it home that day by waiting until the man at the barber shop moved his car so she could pull out of the parking place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury having found the defendant guilty as charged in each of the four indictments returned against him, the judge imposed the following sentences: For the kidnapping of Suzanne Johnson, imprisonment for life; for the kidnapping of Johnny Johnson, imprisonment for not less than 20 nor more than 25 years to commence at the expiration of the life sentence; for crime against nature performed upon Suzanne Johnson, 10 years' imprisonment to run concurrently with the kidnapping sentence; and, for the assault upon Suzanne Johnson with intent to commit rape, 10 years' imprisonment also to run concurrently.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Chatham County Superior Court (North Carolina) which, following a jury trial, convicted defendant of kidnapping, a crime against nature performed on one of the victims, and assault with intent to rape.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant grabbed the female victim around the neck and pointed a gun at her head. Defendant told the male victim to get into his van and lay flat down on the floor. Defendant drove a short distance and then forced the female victim to commit fellatio. The victims separately identified defendant in a lineup. Defendant presented a number of alibi witnesses. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion for change of venue and in failing to suppress the victim's in-court and out-of-court identifications. Defendant also asserted that he was denied his right to counsel at the line-up and that the trial court erred in denying his motion to discover &quot;favorable evidence.&quot; The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a change of venue because, although a number of jurors were familiar with the case, they stated they could be impartial. The court also concluded that the line-up was not impermissibly suggestive and that defendant was not required to be advised of his right to counsel because the lineup was still an investigatory proceeding. Finally, the court found that prosecution's discovery misconduct was not prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On plaintiffs' petition under G.S. 7A-31(a) to review the decision of the Court of Appeals reversing an award of the North Carolina Industrial Commission in plaintiffs' favor, 32 N.C. App. 185 (1977), docketed and argued as Case No. 9 at the Fall Term 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proceeding was begun before the Industrial Commission as a compensation claim for death benefits filed by the widow and four minor children, the sole dependents of Robert S. Booker (Booker), deceased employee of Duke University Medical Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stipulations and plaintiffs' evidence show the following facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker began working for Duke Medical Center on 24 October 1966.  From that date until the first part of July 1971 he worked as a laboratory technician in the Clinical Chemistry Laboratory, where he performed various chemical determinations on serum blood, blood serum, whole blood, and other body fluids.  In the process he manually tested blood samples and, although he was a careful and experienced employee, he routinely spilled blood upon his fingers.  Each day one or more of the blood samples he tested was infected with serum hepatitis.  These samples bore no diagnostic label when they came in or went out, and the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lab technicians never knew whether the patient's blood was diseased.  The blood samples tested were divided about equally between Duke's in-patients and out-patients.  The first of July 1971 Duke began to label all diagnosed hepatic patients' blood which came to the lab, but not all infected blood had been diagnosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 3 July 1971 Booker, who had been totally asymptomatic up until 3 or 4 days prior to that date, developed symptoms which caused him to consult Dr. Joe B. Currin, a specialist in internal medicine.  Dr. Currin ascertained that Booker was suffering from serum hepatitis and hospitalized him for ten days.  Thereafter Booker, who had worked continually with blood samples, ceased handling blood and worked in the lab as an &quot;electronical engineer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July 1972 Dr. Michael E. McLeod of the Department of Medicine at Duke Hospital, Duke Medical Center, took Booker as a patient and treated him for serum hepatitis until Booker's death on 3 January 1974.  During this interim Booker was &quot;in and out&quot; of the hospital on sick leave.  About 1 October 1973 he became unable &quot;to sustain his performance&quot; at the lab, and on 15 October 1973 Dr. McLeod certified that Booker was no longer able&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to work.  The autopsy, performed 3 January 1974 at Duke Medical Center, showed that Booker &quot;died of a disease due to serum hepatitis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, Booker filed a claim with the Industrial Commission in his own behalf.  A hearing was held before Commissioner William H. Stephenson on 18 October 1973.  Thereafter, on 14 December 1973 an order was entered resetting the case on 1 March 1974 for the taking of additional evidence.  Because of Booker's death on 3 January 1974 the case was removed from the hearing docket.  On 16 December 1974 the plaintiffs filed their claims for death benefits, and Commissioner Stephenson conducted a hearing on 10 September 1975.  At that time plaintiffs offered sufficient evidence to establish the facts summarized below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serum hepatitis is a virus disease of the liver which is transmitted when any amount of blood from one infected with the disease is introduced into the blood of another.  It is usually transmitted by transfusions, injections, or contact with blood or blood products through some point of entry such as nicks, cuts, and scratches on the skin.  It might also be transmitted by the handling of feces or orally, as for example, by the use of unsterilized&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  instruments in a dentist's office.  An accidental contact with an &quot;almost microscopic&quot; amount of contaminated blood can transmit serum hepatitis.  Dr. McLeod testified, &quot;Even with our assay of the hepatic antigen, which is the most sensitive assay, one can dilute the blood a million times and still transmit the illness serum hepatitis.&quot; It takes only one exposure to contaminated blood to originate the disease.  Dr. Currin testified that &quot;the incubation period of serum hepatitis is generally considered to be six weeks to six months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serum hepatitis is not a disease limited to persons who handle blood.  Members of the general public are from time to time afflicted with this disease.  Thus, it was not possible for Booker himself or the medical experts and chemist who testified for plaintiffs to state with absolute certainty the time or place at which Booker became infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs offered in evidence the transcript of Booker's testimony given on 18 October 1973 at the hearing upon his claim for disability benefits.  Booker's testimony tended to show that he had never had hepatitis before working as a lab technician at Duke Medical Center and had never known any person who had had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the disease; that he had never had any disabling diseases before contracting serum hepatitis; that he had never handled any fecal materials of any kind in his daily activities; that he had donated blood to the Duke Blood Bank about every six months and &quot;these were the only injections&quot; he ever had.  It was stipulated that Booker donated blood to the Blood Bank at Duke Medical Center on 8 December 1970 and on 26 June 1971, and that the blood was taken by disposable needles which had not previously been used or exposed to any blood other than the donor's.  Booker testified, &quot;[A]lthough I do not know that I contracted hepatitis at Duke or away from Duke, I do know that I had no injections or any blood contact outside of my duties at work.  As far as I am concerned, there is no other way that I could have contracted it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Booker's testimony at the hearing on 10 September 1975 corroborated that of her deceased husband.  She further testified that he &quot;did not make any use of alcoholic beverages&quot;; that one of Booker's hobbies was gardening; that he liked to work in his garden; and that he had &quot;the normal number of scratches, abrasions or whatever about his hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Robert F. Wilderman, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the chemist in charge of the laboratory where Booker worked, testified that as far as he knew Booker was not exposed to hepatitis other than in his work at Duke; that in the performance of his work there he did know that Booker handled many samples of blood and that he came in contact with blood cells from hepatic patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the opinion of Doctors Currin and McLeod there is a much greater likelihood that laboratory technicians in clinical labs at major medical centers will contract serum hepatitis than that persons working in other places will do so, for &quot;the public is generally not nearly so exposed to the hazard.&quot; Booker's situation, Dr. Currin said, was such &quot;that in all likelihood he contracted it through his employment.&quot; Dr. McLeod's testimony was that the conditions under which Booker worked put him &quot;at a much, much higher risk to contract the disease serum hepatitis than other employees in the hospital and people who are not employed in the hospital.&quot; Public health surveys, he said, supported this conclusion.  Further, &quot;all the evidence [Dr. McLeod] could gather did not indicate any other contacts&quot; by Booker &quot;with anybody with hepatitis, jaundice or liver disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  21 October 1975 Commissioner Stephenson filed his opinion and award in which he made findings in accordance with plaintiffs' evidence.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he found: &quot;At sometime between December of 1970 and May 1971, Booker contracted an infection of an internal organ of the body due to exposure to hepatic blood in his employment, the said disease being serum hepatitis.  This disease is characteristic of the occupation of a laboratory worker such as Booker.  The general public is not as exposed to this disease as is a laboratory technician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon these findings he concluded: &quot;(1) . . . Booker contracted an infection of an internal organ of the body [serum hepatitis] due to exposure to materials and substances in his employment.  G.S. 97-53(13) [as amended 1 July 1963.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">See</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1963 N.C. Sess. Laws, ch. 965.] (2) Said occupational disease resulted in his death on January 3, 1974; (3) The rights and liabilities of the parties are governed by the statute as it existed in May of 1971.  G.S. 97-52.  (4) Defendants are obligated to pay plaintiff compensation at the rate of $ 50.00 per week for 350 weeks beginning January 1, 1974 by reason of Booker's death.  G.S. 97-38.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the award&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entered upon these findings and conclusions all parties appealed to the full Commission.  On appeal, with two significant alterations, the full Commission adopted the findings and conclusions of the hearing commissioner as its own.  First, it concluded that Booker's disease was a compensable occupational disease because it &quot;was caused by conditions characteristic of and peculiar to his occupation of lab technician, and is one to which the general public is not equally exposed.  G.S. 97-53(13) [as amended 1 July 1971.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">See</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-53(13) (1972).]&quot; Second, it reversed the hearing commissioner's ruling that &quot;[t]he rights and liabilities of the parties are governed by the statute as it existed in May 1971,&quot; the latest possible date for Booker's contraction of hepatitis, and concluded that &quot;[t]he rights and liabilities of the parties to this action are governed by the statute as it existed on 3 January 1974 [the date of Booker's death].&quot; G.S. 97-38 (as amended 1 July 1973); G.S. 97-52; G.S. 97-53(13) (as amended 1 July 1971).  Amendments to the Act, enacted in the interim between the dates of contraction and death, were thereby rendered applicable to plaintiffs' &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  claims.  Those changes made &quot;the appropriate maximum benefits to be applied $ 80.00 per week and $ 32,500.00 overall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duke Medical Center and its carrier appealed the full Commission's decision to the Court of Appeals, which reversed the award.  This Court allowed claimants' petition for discretionary review.  Under App. R.16(a) defendant-appellees bring forward assignments of error to the Industrial Commission's award which were not considered by the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

Decedent filed a claim with the Industrial Commission, but died before the hearing could be held. Plaintiff dependents filed claims for death benefits, and a hearing was conducted which resulted in an award to plaintiffs. Defendants appealed, and the decision was reversed, with the reviewing court holding that the injury was not the result of an accident because no specific incident could be identified which led to the contracting of the disease and the claim should have been governed by the law in effect at the time he contracted the disease. On further review, the court reversed and remanded, holding that plaintiffs' right to compensation did not arise until decedent's death, so the date of his death governed which statute applied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On plaintiff's petition under G.S. 7A-31(a) for discretionary review of the judgment entered by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Browning, S.J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 13 February 1978 special civil session of Halifax, docketed and argued as Case No. 100 at the Fall Term 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 5 July 1977, by and through his duly appointed guardian ad litem, plaintiff brought this action for a declaratory judgment adjudicating his right to one third of the estate of William Henry Freuler, who died intestate on 25 December 1976.  Plaintiff claims to be the illegitimate son of Freuler.  The defendants are Freuler's two daughters, their husbands, and Freuler's administrator, who was appointed on 6 January 1977.  In his complaint plaintiff alleges:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 29 March 1962 plaintiff was born to Evelyn Mitchell and William Freuler.  Evelyn Mitchell and Freuler were never married; nor did Freuler either legitimate or adopt plaintiff.  During the last seven years of his life, however, Freuler lived with Miss Mitchell and plaintiff.  He &quot;acknowledged&quot; plaintiff to be his son, purchased insurance policies for him, maintained savings accounts for him, and had plaintiff work with him at his automobile parts shop.  Although he had expressed his intention&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to provide for plaintiff after his death, he died suddenly without having executed a will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff further avers that, under the statutory law of North Carolina -- G.S. 29-19 (1976) and the statutes referred to therein -- he is not entitled to share in Freuler's estate.  He asserts, however, that the United States Supreme Court, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Trimble v. Gordon</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 430 U.S. 762, 52 L.Ed. 2d 31, 97 S.Ct. 1459 (1977), has invalidated G.S. 29-19 as &quot;an invidious discrimination on the basis of illegitimacy . . . and is, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff's prayer for relief is that the Court (1) set aside the State's intestate succession statutes insofar as they operate to prevent plaintiff from sharing Freuler's estate equally with his two daughters, and (2) order Freuler's administrator to distribute his net estate in equal shares to the two daughters and plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In answering the complaint, inter alia, defendants deny that plaintiff is Freuler's child and assert that the decision of the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Trimble v. Gordon</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has no application to the North Carolina statutes with reference to the right of an illegitimate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  child to inherit from his father.  However, in the event the Court should hold G.S. 29-19 invalid, defendants request a jury trial on the issue whether plaintiff is the son of Freuler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 17 January 1978, pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rule 12(b), defendants moved to dismiss the complaint because it shows that plaintiff is an illegitimate child who does not meet the requirements of G.S. 29-19.  Judge Browning granted defendants' motion and dismissed the case.  Plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals and, upon his petition to bypass that court, we allowed discretionary review under G.S. 7A-31(a).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, illegitimate son and guardian ad litem, sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Halifax County (North Carolina), which granted the motion to dismiss of defendants, daughters and spouses, administrator, and the State of North Carolina (state), in a declaratory judgment action seeking the adjudication of the son's right to one-third of the intestate's estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The intestate lived with the illegitimate son and the son's mother for the last years of the intestate's life, and he acknowledged the son as his own. The son's mother and the intestate never married. After the intestate died suddenly, the son and his guardian ad litem filed a declaratory judgment action seeking an adjudication of the son's right to one-third of the intestate's estate. The superior court granted the motion to dismiss filed by the daughters and spouses, the administrator, and the state. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that an illegitimate child was allowed to inherit, by, through, and from his putative father upon proof of paternity as set forth under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-19, N.C. Gen. Stat.&nbsp;&sect;&sect; 49-10 through -12, and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 49-14 through -16. Further, by specifying the manner and time in which an illegitimate could establish his paternity, the state sought to equalize the inheritance rights of legitimate and illegitimate children. Thus, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-19 and the statutes in pari materia did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because they were substantially related to the lawful state interests that they were intended to promote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged with the crime of murder in the first degree.  Prior to trial, his counsel filed a &quot;motion in limine&quot; seeking a ruling that all evidence relating to defendant's association with a motorcycle club known as &quot;The Outlaws&quot; be excluded.  Judge Thornburg reserved ruling until the &quot;approximate time during the course of trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In summary, the State's evidence was as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Cearley, a student at UNCC, testified that on 25 October 1975 at about 10:30 p.m., he went into an establishment in Mecklenburg County known as &quot;The Hut.&quot; After about 45 minutes, he went to the bathroom, and as he returned to the main area of the establishment, he saw three men fighting in the center of the dance floor.  As he moved through the crowd toward the fighting men, he observed that there were only two men engaged in the fight.  He then saw defendant, whom he described as being about five feet seven inches tall, weighing approximately 215 pounds, wearing a full beard and having long reddish brown hair walk up to the two men and shoot one of them in the back of the head. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was later told that the man who was wounded was Roger Bartee.  He noted that at trial defendant was much thinner than he was on the night of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglas Rhyne, who was also at &quot;The Hut&quot; on the night of 25 October 1975 and the early morning hours of 26 October 1975, stated that he had seen defendant on prior occasions but had never been &quot;introduced&quot; to him.  He had noticed defendant because he wore clothes which identified him as belonging to a motorcycle group known as &quot;The Outlaws.&quot; The witness stated that he had known Roger Bartee for over three years.  He was standing outside &quot;The Hut&quot; when he heard a &quot;scuffle&quot; and upon entering he saw Roger Bartee and a man he had also previously noticed because he too wore &quot;Outlaw colors.&quot; The two were locked together near the juke box.  He then saw defendant grab Bartee by the shoulder and shoot him in the back of the head with a .45 caliber automatic pistol.  The pistol was about four or five inches from Bartee's head when it was fired.  Defendant then left the scene.  The witness was shown a photograph of defendant, and he stated that it correctly portrayed defendant's appearance as of October, 1975.  He testified that defendant's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appearance at trial differed in that at the time of the shooting defendant had long hair, a full beard and was much heavier.  The photograph was admitted into evidence over defendant's objection as State's Exhibit 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Garcia, the manager and bartender of &quot;The Hut&quot; at the time of the shooting, stated that the establishment was frequented by a motorcycle club known as &quot;The Outlaws.&quot; These men would bring pistols to the establishment and store them in an area behind the bar.  Donald &quot;Gangrene&quot; Sears and Edgar Curtis &quot;Moe&quot; Ruof were members of &quot;The Outlaws&quot; club.  On the night of the shooting, Roger Bartee and his girlfriend were dancing.  The witness observed Bartee twirling a two inch knife, and he told Bartee to put the knife away.  At this point, &quot;Gangrene&quot; who had been sitting at the bar approached Bartee and a fistfight started between the two.  He then saw defendant go behind the bar, return and join in the fight.  He saw a handgun in defendant's hand and thereafter heard a shot.  After observing Bartee lying on the floor, he called the police.  He did not see a weapon in Bartee's hand during the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debra Jean Payne testified that she accompanied her fiance Roger Bartee&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to &quot;The Hut&quot; on the night of 25 October 1975.  Sometime after midnight, they were standing near the bar talking with friends about an incident which had occurred the night before when a man came up and asked Roger what they were talking about.  When Roger answered, the man struck at Roger who then removed and handed her his glasses.  The men started a fistfight, and she saw another man, who came from the area of the bar, shoot Roger in the head at close range.  She was unable to make an in-court identification of defendant as the man who did the shooting but identified State's Exhibit 5 as correctly portraying the man who shot Roger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott Moody testified that during the early morning hours of 26 October 1975, he was standing outside &quot;The Hut,&quot; and upon hearing a &quot;rumpus,&quot; he looked inside.  He observed two men wrestling, and he then saw the defendant walk up to the men and shoot Bartee in the head.  He knew both Bartee and defendant by sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered evidence to the effect that defendant was arrested in Florida where he was living under an assumed name.  There was also medical testimony that Bartee died as a result of a gunshot wound to the head fired by a weapon at almost&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contact range.  The State's other evidence was corroborative in nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified that he was at &quot;The Hut&quot; on the evening of 25 October 1975.  He was sitting at the bar with Donald &quot;Gangrene&quot; Sears and some girlfriends when he noticed Roger Bartee standing in the dance floor with an opened knife in his hand.  Bartee looked at him and said that he &quot;was the baddest one in the bar.&quot; The witness said that he immediately went into the back room behind the bar where he picked up his .45 caliber Colt automatic pistol and stuck it in his belt.  When he reentered the main area, he saw Bartee strike Sears in the chest in a manner which drove Sears across the room.  Defendant stated that he thought Bartee was stabbing Sears, and he, thereupon, pulled his gun and hit Bartee on the head.  The gun accidentally discharged, and he fled because he was frightened.  He thought that his pistol was on safety or &quot;half-cocked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant also offered evidence tending to show that Bartee had the reputation of being a violent fighting man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In rebuttal, the State offered Eric Johnson, a qualified firearms examiner, who testified that the weapon that defendant used on the morning of 26 October 1975&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  did not fire in a &quot;half-cocked&quot; position unless the trigger was pulled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree, and defendant appealed from judgment imposing a sentence of life imprisonment.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder, and the court affirmed his conviction. Although defendant asserted that the trial court failed to grant his motion in limine for exclusion of allegedly prejudicial material, the court found that the trial court had acted within its discretion. Similarly, the court found that the trial court correctly admitted relevant evidence even though that evidence may have excited the jury's sympathy. Defendant asserted that the prosecution's failure to comply with his discovery request under N.C Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-910 comprised error but the court noted that under the terms of that statute the trial court had discretion in choosing to prohibit the party that offered nondisclosed evidence from introducing it. The court also noted that the trial court had wide discretion in determining whether defendant's cross-examination had been unfair and found that the prosecution's closing argument was not so prejudicial as to have deprived defendant of a fair trial. Finally, the court found that the jury charge was adequate and that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have concluded that defendant, after premeditation, deliberately committed murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants from the judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Thornburg, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered in the 24 October 1977 Criminal Session of Madison County Superior Court.  This case was docketed and argued during Fall Term 1978 as Number 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In indictments, proper in form, the defendants were each charged with the first degree murder of Bennie Hudgins and the first degree murder of Tommy Norton.  They entered pleas of not guilty as to all the charges, which were consolidated for trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial the evidence for the State tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 12 June 1977 Mrs. Evelyn Alemany, Lloyd Romero, age thirteen, Raymond Romero, age fifteen, Debbie Romero, age sixteen, and the two defendants were camping in some woods near Big Laurel River in Madison County.  Mrs. Alemany is the mother of the three Romeros and defendant Turpin; the Romero children are the half-brothers and half-sister of defendant Turpin.  Defendant Crews is unrelated to all the others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These people came to Madison County in Mrs. Alemany's Buick with a U-Haul trailer attached to it.  The car developed two flat tires, and on 12 June 1977 the defendants decided they had to leave the area.  The defendants told Debbie Romero to go out to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  highway and stop someone &quot;and make sure there are no women in the car and . . . make sure there are only two people in the car.&quot; They told Debbie that if she did not, they would hurt Raymond or Lloyd.  At that time both defendants had guns with them.  Debbie stopped a pickup truck containing an elderly man and a young boy, but she became frightened and told them to keep going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At defendants' suggestion, Lloyd Romero then went to the road, and a pickup truck containing Bennie Hudgins and Tommy Norton stopped.  The boy told them his mother had two flat tires and asked if they could help.  Lloyd got in the truck with the two men, and the three of them drove toward the camp site.  Lloyd jumped out of the truck and hid next to the creek.  He was scared the men were going to be shot because of statements previously made by defendant Crews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants came out of the bushes and approached the truck.  Defendant Crews yelled for the two men to get out and put their wallets on top of the truck.  Tommy Norton complied.  Bennie Hudgins refused, so defendant Crews shot him in the back, took Mr. Hudgins' wallet from his pocket and threw the body next to the creek.  Mr. Hudgins died as a result&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of that wound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Crews then told defendant Turpin to shoot Tommy Norton &quot;and let's get out of here.&quot; Defendant Crews then returned to camp with the pickup truck.  He told Mrs. Alemany, Debbie and Raymond to take the things out of the truck and throw them in the creek, which they did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, defendant Turpin and Tommy Norton were still up by the road.  Tommy Norton was crying and begged defendant Turpin three times not to shoot him because he had children at home.  Mr. Norton started running up a hill, and defendant Turpin shot him in the arm with a scope rifle.  He fell, and defendant Turpin ran up to him and shot him in the head.  Mr. Norton died from this head wound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Turpin and Lloyd Romero returned to camp.  Defendant Turpin stated that he did not shoot the second man because &quot;he [defendant Turpin] didn't want us [Lloyd and Raymond Romero] to know that he was a killer.&quot; Lloyd Romero testified, however, that he actually saw defendant Turpin shoot Tommy Norton in the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some gasoline was siphoned from the pickup truck and was sprinkled on Mrs. Alemany's car.  The car was then set on fire.  Defendant Crews had stated that he wanted this done &quot;because&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he didn't want his fingerprints or anything there to show that he had been there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Alemany, the three Romero children and the two defendants all got in the pickup truck and drove to Dresden, Tennessee so that defendant Crews could visit with his family.  Once there, defendant Crews decided to remain with his family, and Debbie Romero stayed with him.  She claimed that she did not want to stay, but her family just left her there.  Mrs. Alemany testified that defendant Crews made Debbie Romero stay with him &quot;to guarantee that I [Mrs. Alemany] kept my mouth shut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After leaving defendant Crews and Debbie in Dresden, Tennessee, Mrs. Alemany, Lloyd and Raymond Romero and defendant Turpin began driving to California in Tommy Norton's pickup truck.  On 14 June 1977 they were seen siphoning gas out of a church bus by Reverend Grant Atkinson in Cripple Creek, Colorado.  The police were notified, and a chase ensued between the truck and the officers.  Eventually the pickup truck was forced to stop near an open field, but no one was in it by the time the police arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About an hour later the officers apprehended Mrs. Alemany, Raymond and Lloyd in a field near the truck.  They informed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the police there was a fourth occupant, defendant Turpin, who may be armed.  Defendant Turpin was arrested one hour later after he was discovered riding in a red pickup truck that was stopped at a roadblock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Alemany and the two Romero boys told the officers in Colorado that the pickup truck they were riding in had been stolen.  They also mentioned the murders that had occurred in North Carolina, although there was some question as to whether Tommy Norton had been killed or had gotten away.  This information was relayed to Sheriff Ponder of Madison County, and the bodies of Bennie Hudgins and Tommy Norton were found that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for defendant Crews tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven members of defendant Crews' family testified to his good reputation in the Dresden, Tennessee community.  His wife also testified to defendant Crews' good reputation at Fort Jackson, South Carolina and Fort Campbell, Kentucky, places he had been stationed in the Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlotte Crews, defendant Crews' wife, testified that she and defendant Crews got married in January, 1975, and he joined the Army in December of that year.  They have a daughter who is fifteen months old.  In the Spring&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of 1977 they were living at Fort Campbell.  Mrs. Crews discovered that defendant Crews was having an affair with Debbie Romero, so she left him and went to California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Kathleen Crews, defendant Crews' mother, testified that Mrs. Alemany and Debbie Romero had been to her home in Tennessee with defendant Crews two times before June of 1977.  On one occasion Mrs. Crews told Mrs. Alemany that she &quot;didn't approve&quot; of her and asked her to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 June 1977 her son, defendant Turpin, Mrs. Alemany, Debbie Romero and the two Romero boys came to her house about 10:30 a.m. They stayed about one hour, and then all of them except Debbie and defendant Crews left.  Mrs. Crews stated that she had told Mrs. Alemany Debbie could not stay there, and Mrs. Alemany replied that &quot;she was going to leave her there anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Crews' sister, Mrs. Elizabeth Poag, testified that she had discussed the events of 12 June 1977 with Debbie Romero.  Debbie had told her that Debbie's brother had killed one of the men and her mother had killed the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Crews took the stand on his own behalf.  He testified that on 12 May 1977 he went AWOL from the Army because &quot;I [defendant Crews] was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  depressed with the way the Army was treating me.&quot; He and Debbie Romero went to Dresden, Tennessee to get his car fixed.  They returned to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and the next day he, defendant Turpin, Mrs. Alemany, Debbie Romero and the two Romero boys left Kentucky.  The two defendants were in defendant Crews' car, and the others were in Mrs. Alemany's Buick.  They all went to Chicago to visit some of defendant Crews' relatives, and defendant Crews left his car with some cousins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 10 June 1977 Mrs. Alemany decided that the group would camp along Big Laurel River in Madison County.  On Sunday, 12 June 1977 defendant Turpin and Mrs. Alemany got into an argument during breakfast.  Mrs. Alemany broke a plate over her son's hand and threw a butcher knife at him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That morning, about 11:00 a.m., defendant Crews left the camp site and sat down in the woods.  He was thinking about his wife and child and about getting back to Fort Campbell.  He heard some shots and thought someone was target shooting.  As he returned to the camp, he saw a roadblock and &quot;thought I [defendant Crews] saw a body.&quot; At the camp he noticed the others taking things from the U-Haul trailer and putting them into&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the back of a pickup truck.  After they were finished, Mrs. Alemany's car was set on fire, and all of them left in the truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Crews stated he never asked anyone what had happened or how the truck had gotten there.  The first time he knew two men were killed was when he was arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group drove to Dresden, Tennessee, and defendant Crews decided to stay with his family.  Debbie Romero also stayed because she wanted to go back to Fort Campbell with him and get a job.  Defendant Crews denied ever having told Mrs. Alemany he would harm Debbie if her mother talked to the police, and there was no indication Debbie did not want to stay in Dresden or was doing so involuntarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Turpin presented no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court charged the jury that they could find either or both defendants guilty of first degree murder, second degree murder or not guilty as to the deaths of Bennie Hudgins and Tommy Norton.  The jury found both defendants guilty of two first degree murders.  After hearing evidence concerning the sentencing of defendants, the jury recommended life imprisonment for each defendant.  After an imposition of two consecutive life sentences for both defendants, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  they appealed to this Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other facts relevant to the decision will be included in the opinion below.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed from a judgment entered in the Madison County Superior Court (North Carolina) that convicted and sentenced defendants of first-degree murder and denied defendants' motions for change of venue or, in the alternative, for a special venire to be summoned from outside the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both defendants claimed the trial court erred in denying their motions for change of venue or, in the alternative, for a special venire to be summoned from outside the county. Defendants based their motions primarily on the pretrial publicity of the crimes that was contained in local newspapers. The court found that none of the jurors that were impaneled were biased or prejudiced in any way and overruled the assignment of error. Defendants next argued that the trial court erred in denying their motions for severance. The court found that neither defendant made an extrajudicial statement or confession that was introduced at trial, and neither defendant had shown any prejudice stemming from the joint trial. Defendants also claimed the trial court erred in denying them access to all the requested material. The court stated that the material asked for was privileged and consisted of reports and test results on the children by practicing psychologists and the trial judge had the discretion to refuse the inspection. Finally, the court found that failure of defendants to receive a pretrial psychiatric examination was not error because defendants did not have a right to the examination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment that convicted and sentenced defendants for first-degree murder was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff registered voters sought an injunction and a writ of mandamus against defendant county election board alleging that it systematically violated the state's election laws by registering as voters intervenor students who were not residents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to filing suit, the registered voters unsuccessfully attempted to resolve this dispute administratively. The action was initially filed against the county election board and the state election board. The trial court dismissed the state election board as a party, denied the students' motion to intervene, and granted a preliminary injunction. This appeal followed, which was certified to this court prior to the appellate court rendering a decision. The court affirmed the order dismissing the state election board as a party; otherwise, the trial court's order was vacated. The trial court had original jurisdiction because the administrative proceeding was not a contested case. Thus, the registered voters' failure to appeal therefrom did not warrant a dismissal. The complaint stated a claim upon which relief could be granted. There was insufficient evidence to support the preliminary injunction because the registered voters failed to show the county election board had not required the students to prove their domicile. The court declined to modify the principles set forth in prior case law, which governed registration of student voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants and cross-appeal by the State from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Small, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 4 January 1978 Session of Onslow Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 12 December 1977 the State, through William H. Andrews, District Attorney for the Fourth District, filed a complaint against defendants, a South Carolina corporation doing business in Jacksonville, North Carolina and its officers and employees.  The complaint alleged that defendants maintained a business, Chateau X Theater and Bookstore, for the purpose of illegal exhibitions and sales to the public of obscene and lewd films and publications as a regular and predominant course of business.  Among other relief not relevant to this appeal, it prayed that Chateau X be declared a nuisance under Chapter 19 of North Carolina General Statutes.  The State also asked that an injunction issue ordering that defendants be &quot;perpetually enjoined from maintaining, using, continuing, owning or leasing said place known as Chateau X Theater and Bookstore . . . as a nuisance&quot; and &quot;any place in the State of North Carolina as a nuisance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 20 December 1977 defendants made a motion to dismiss the action or, in the alternative, to continue it.  They based this motion on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the fact that there was a declaratory judgment action pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina to test the constitutionality of Chapter 19.  On 4 January 1978 defendants filed their answer along with a motion to dismiss the State's complaint on the ground that Chapter 19 is unconstitutional.  After argument, the trial court denied defendants' motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties, by mutual stipulation, waived a jury trial.  Trial was conducted before the judge beginning on 4 January 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial the State introduced twenty exhibits into evidence without objection by defendants.  Nineteen of these were copies of magazines and films possessed for sale or shown by Chateau X. State's Exhibit Number 20 was an inventory of materials found at that operation on 12 December 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge personally viewed State's Exhibit Number 15, a film called &quot;Airline Cockpit,&quot; and State's Exhibit Number 3, a magazine entitled &quot;Spread Your Legs.&quot; The parties mutually stipulated that all the films and magazines listed in the inventory, State's Exhibit Number 20, &quot;contain substantially similar material&quot; as is found in State's Exhibit Number 15 and State's Exhibit Number&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants presented no evidence.  The parties stipulated, however, &quot;[t]hat if the defendants would testify, the evidence would indicate that the motion pictures exhibited and the books distributed and sold were done to consenting adults.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge found that State's Exhibits Numbers 15 and 3 are obscene, that the remainder of the nineteen films and magazines introduced into evidence are obscene, and that all the materials listed in the inventory are obscene.  He held that all the above films and magazines are nuisances.  He also declared Chateau X itself to be a nuisance under Chapter 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge ordered that all the material listed on the inventory, State's Exhibit Number 20, be confiscated and destroyed.  He enjoined the defendants from exhibiting or selling any of these items.  The defendants also were enjoined from selling or showing any other obscene matter in the future which depicted certain specific sexual conduct listed in the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his final order the trial judge interpreted a part of G.S. 19-5 as authorizing the actual closing of a business after it had been declared a nuisance.  He held this portion unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the defendants and the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State gave timely notice of appeal from the trial court's final judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 24 April 1978 the parties petitioned this Court pursuant to G.S. 7A-31(b) for review prior to it being determined by the Court of Appeals.  We allowed the petition on 8 May 1978.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both the state and defendants, adult bookstore and its officers and employees, appealed a decision of the Onslow Superior Court (North Carolina), which declared defendant bookstore to be a nuisance and enjoined defendants from selling or showing obscene material depicting specific sexual conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court declared defendant adult bookstore to be a nuisance and enjoined defendants, bookstore and its officers and employees, from selling or showing obscene material depicting specific sexual conduct, and defendants and the state appealed. The court held that the trial court had some discretion to define what conduct was prohibited by the injunction as long as it fell within constitutional and statutory mandates, and that it had a duty to specifically warn defendants of the prohibited conduct. The court held that not every isolated obscene publication was a nuisance that could be abated. The court held that even if N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19-5&nbsp;unconstitutionally authorized the complete closing of a business for past sales of obscene material, such provision was divisible from the remainder of the statute and could be adequately enforced without it. The court held that the state had the burden of proving obscenity. The court held that the failure of the injunction to specifically state that the enjoined sexual conduct being depicted was patently offensive was not fatal, and that the injunction was not an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

In addition to the evidence given by the victim, there was eyewitness testimony by Ethel Jones to the effect that on 11 September 1977 she saw Tanya Joyce Suggs enter a green Buick automobile which was being operated by defendant.  Police officers testified in corroboration of the witnesses Suggs and Jones concerning prior statements made by the witnesses to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Rudolph I. Mintz, Jr., who was qualified as a medical expert in gynecology, testified that he examined Tanya Suggs on 11 September 1977 and found lacerations and bruises around the entrance to the vagina.  Spermatozoa was also found in the vagina.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of first-degree rape and kidnapping, and received concurrent life sentences. Defendant appealed, alleging errors by the trial court. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that admission of in-court identification testimony of the girl and another witness was not error because the taking of defendant's photograph prior to his arrest did not violate N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-502, which clearly did not prevent such photographs for evidentiary use and because the photographic procedures were not so conducive to misidentification as to violate defendant's due process rights. Admission of certain physical evidence, photographs, and testimony obtained from a search of defendant's apartment and car pursuant to warrants was not error because there were no irregularities as to the searches that would taint the evidence. The denial of a directed verdict was proper because the alleged lack of proof of penetration was without merit. Section 14-21(1)(a) was not violative of equal protection as gender-based because it was rationally related to the legitimate government objective of protecting young girls.</SPAN></P>

He received sentences of life imprisonment for the rape, one of the kidnappings and one of the armed robberies, a sentence of 40 years for the other armed robbery, and a sentence of 20 years for the felonious assault, all to be served consecutively.  He also received a life sentence for the other kidnapping to be served concurrently with the first kidnapping sentence.

After taking them to a deserted place defendant robbed both victims at gunpoint, shot one person twice causing serious injury but not death, and raped the other. The defense was alibi. The question presented was whether it was permissible under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-39 to sentence defendant for the rape, the felonious assault, and each of the armed robberies, while at the same time sentencing him to life imprisonment for the kidnappings, without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause of U.S. Const. amend. V and the Law of the Land Clause of the North Carolina Constitution. The court found no error and affirmed his convictions. The court held that the kidnapping indictments charged that defendant confined, restrained, and removed his victims from one place to another for the purpose of facilitating the commission of robberies and other felonies. In order to prove kidnapping it was only necessary to prove a purpose of robbery or the other felonies and not the commission of the felonies themselves.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs Jack Adams, et al., instituted their action on 5 November 1976.  Plaintiffs Alphious K. Everett, Sr., et al., instituted their action on 24 March 1977.  Upon joint motion of plaintiffs and defendants these actions were consolidated for trial on 29 August 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this consolidated action, brought under the Declaratory Judgment Act, plaintiffs attack the constitutionality of the Coastal Area Management Act of 1974, G.S. 113A-100, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, hereinafter referred to as the Act.  Plaintiffs allege in pertinent part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. That the Act is a prohibited local act under Article II, section 24 of the North Carolina Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That the Act delegates authority to the Coastal Resources Commission (hereinafter referred to as CRC) to develop and adopt &quot;State Guidelines&quot; for the coastal area without providing adequate standards to govern the exercise of the power delegated in violation of Article I, section 6 and Article II, section 1 of the North Carolina Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. That the provisions of the Act, and the State guidelines adopted by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the CRC, deprive them of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and in violation of Article I, section 19 of the North Carolina Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. That Section 113A-126 of the Act authorizes warrantless searches by the CRC which are repugnant to the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, section 20 of the North Carolina Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. That the guidelines for the coastal area promulgated by the CRC exceed the powers delegated by the Act and are impermissibly inconsistent with the goals of the Act as set forth in Section 113A-102.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coastal Area Management Act of 1974 is a &quot;cooperative program of coastal area management between local and state governments.&quot; (G.S. 113A-101).  Its basic objective is to &quot;establish a comprehensive plan for the protection, preservation, orderly development and management of the coastal area of North Carolina.&quot; (G.S. 113A-102(a)).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Primary responsibility for implementing the Act is given to a fifteen-member citizen panel, the CRC, all but three of whom must have expertise in a specific phase of coastal activity such as commercial fishing, coastal engineering, coastal agriculture&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or coastal land development, or in local government in the twenty-county coastal area.  Twelve of the fifteen are nominees of local government; all are appointed by the Governor.  (G.S. 113A-104).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CRC is assisted by the Coastal Resources Advisory Council (CRAC), composed of representatives appointed by each of the twenty coastal counties, plus four from coastal multi-county planning groups and eight from coastal towns and cities, as well as marine scientists and representatives of State agencies involved in coastal programs (G.S. 113A-105(b)).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coastal area is generally defined as including all counties bordering the Atlantic Ocean or one of the coastal sounds.  G.S. 113A-103(2).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of activities, including certain agricultural activities, are exempted from coverage of the Act by G.S. 113A-103(5)b.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four basic mechanisms are utilized by the Act to accomplish its objectives:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. State Guidelines For The Coastal Area Are To Be Promulgated By The CRC. G.S. 113A-106 through 108.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CRC is to develop State guidelines for the coastal area, specifying objectives, policies and standards to be followed in public and private use of land and water in the coastal area.  These&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  guidelines are to give particular attention to the nature of development which shall be appropriate within the various types of area of environmental concern designated by the CRC.  (See Part III, infra.) G.S. 113A-107.  The State guidelines have a threefold effect.  All county land use plans (see Part II, infra) must be consistent with the guidelines.  All development permits granted (see Part IV, infra) must be consistent with the guidelines.  Finally, all land policies of the State relating to acquisition, use, disposition, and classification of coastal land shall be consistent with the guidelines.  G.S. 113A-108.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. Land Use Plans Are To Be Adopted By Each County Within The Coastal Area.  G.S. 113A-109 through 112.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A land use plan is to &quot;consist of statements of objectives, policies, and standards to be followed in public and private use of land within the county&quot; which shall be supplemented by maps showing the appropriate location of particular types of land or water use in particular areas.  The plan shall give special attention to the protection and appropriate development of areas of environmental concern designated by the CRC. G.S. 113A-110(a).  If a coastal county fails&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to adopt a land use plan the CRC shall promptly prepare such a plan.  G.S. 113A-109.  The land use plans are to be consistent with the State guidelines promulgated by the CRC. G.S. 113A-110(a).  No land use plan shall become effective until it is approved by the CRC. G.S. 113A-110(f).  The county land use plans have a twofold effect.  No development permit shall be issued under Part IV (infra) which is inconsistent with the approved land use plan for the county in which the development is proposed.  G.S. 113A-111.  No local ordinance or regulation shall be adopted within an area of environmental concern (see Part III, infra) which is inconsistent with the land use plan of the county in which said ordinance or regulation is effected.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Id.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. Designation Of Areas Of Environmental Concern By The CRC Through Rule Making.  G.S. 113A-113 through 115.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The [CRC] shall by rule designate geographic areas of the coastal area as areas of environmental concern and specify the boundaries thereof. . . .&quot; G.S. 113A-113(a).  In specifying areas of environmental concern (AEC) the CRC is to consider the criteria listed in G.S. 113A-113(b).  &quot;Prior to adopting any rule permanently designating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any [AEC] the Secretary and the [CRC] shall hold a public hearing in each county in which lands to be affected are located, at which public and private parties shall have the opportunity to present comment and views.&quot; G.S. 113A-115(a).  The CRC shall review the designated AEC's at least biennially.  New AEC's may be added and others deleted in accordance with the procedures outlined above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IV. Permits Must Be Obtained For Development Within AEC's.  G.S. 113A-116 through 125.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every person before undertaking any development in any AEC must obtain a permit.  G.S. 113A-118(a).  Permits for major developments are obtained from the CRC and permits for minor developments are obtained in the first instance from the county in which the development is to take place.  Permits for major development are obtained through a formal, quasi-judicial proceeding.  G.S. 113A-122.  All permit applicants for major development are entitled to a hearing in which evidence is taken and the rules of procedure applicable to civil actions are followed insofar as practicable.  A transcript of this hearing is forwarded to the CRC which renders a decision supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Id.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Any person directly affected by any final decision or order of the CRC may appeal to the superior court for judicial review.  G.S. 113A-123.  Permits for minor development are procured from the designated local official pursuant to an expedited system of review.  These expedited procedures are formulated at the local level.  G.S. 113A-121.  Any person directly affected by a decision of the designated local official may request a hearing before the CRC. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Id.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The procedure followed at this hearing is identical to that followed at hearings for major development permits.  G.S. 113A-122.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court upheld in all respects the constitutionality of the Act and the State guidelines promulgated by the CRC.  Plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals, and we allowed motion to bypass that court to the end that initial appellate review be had in the Supreme Court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owners challenged judgments from the Carteret Superior Court (North Carolina), which ruled in favor of defendants, state environmental entities, upholding the constitutionality of the Coastal Area Management Act of 1974, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 113A-100 et seq., and the state guidelines promulgated by defendant Coastal Resources Commission. Plaintiffs sought review in a consolidated action brought under the Declaratory Judgment Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In plaintiff property owners' constitutional challenge of the Coastal Area Management Act of 1974 (Act), N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 113A-100 et seq., the court found that the coastal counties' natural resources and environmental needs, unique, fragile, and irreplaceable nature, and its significance to the public welfare were sufficiently unique and amply justified special legislative treatment. The court asserted that the constitutional prohibition against local legislation required only that the legislative definition be reasonably related to the Act's purpose and concluded that the coastal zone's western boundary, determined by the seawater encroachment criterion, was reasonably related to the Act's purpose. The court held that the Act was a general law that the state legislature had power to enact and that it properly delegated authority to defendant Coastal Resources Commission to develop, adopt, and amend state guidelines for the coastal area. The court agreed with the trial court that there was no taking of plaintiffs' property, that plaintiffs' assertions rested on speculative assumptions, and that apprehension of diminished land values was premature. The judgments were affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgments, which upheld the constitutionality of the Coastal Area Management Act from plaintiff property owners' challenge. Delegation of power by the state legislature to defendants, state environmental entities, was proper. Allegations of taking were too speculative to be justiciable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. The Petitioners, Charles E. Dail and Hans A. Staps, through counsel and in open court, in addition to the written stipulations, stipulate and agree that the City of Goldsboro has followed the statutory procedures within the meaning of G.S. 160A-50(f)(1) and that no objections are raised in this regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. The City of Goldsboro, within the time required by law, transmitted to the Superior Court a transcript of that portion of the City's Minute Book in which the procedure for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  annexation had been set out and a copy of the report setting forth the plans for extending services to the annexed area as required by G.S. 160A-47.  The report of the proceeding so certified was admitted as evidence and duly considered by the Court as a part of the record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. The evidence showed plans to provide services to the area annexed within the meaning of the statutory requirements:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) The maps of the municipality and the area to be annexed were introduced showing the present and proposed boundaries of the municipality and the present major trunk water mains and sewers interceptors and outfall and extensions thereof.  Further, said maps showed the general land use patterns in the area to be annexed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) The City of Goldsboro extended police protection to the area to be annexed on the date of annexation on substantially the same basis and in the same manner as such services are provided within the rest of the municipality prior to annexation.  The City of Goldsboro has concurrent jurisdiction with the United States of America within the 3157 acre tract owned by the United States of America.  The City of Goldsboro exercises its criminal jurisdiction over civilian personnel&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for violation of criminal laws committed within the 3157 acre tract, but it has no jurisdiction over the military personnel located thereon.  The City of Goldsboro has employed five (5) additional police officers, and since February 7, 1977, it has provided police protecton to the 59.25 acre tract and the 3157 acre tract.  That in the event the United States of America shall cease to provide police protection, the City of Goldsboro would provide said service provided it had the jurisdiction to act accordingly.  The City of Goldsboro has sufficient monies to provide and finance said service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(c) The City of Goldsboro extended fire protection to the area to be annexed and has provided said protection since February 7, 1977, on substantially the same basis and in the same manner as such services are provided within the rest of the municipality prior to annexation.  That the United States Government maintains its own fire department on Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, and the City of Goldsboro has a mutual aid agreement with Seymour Johnson Air Force Base.  That for military and security reasons, the United States of America has not called upon the City of Goldsboro to provide fire protection&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the 3157 acre tract.  In the event the United States of America shall cease to provide fire protection on Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, then the City of Goldsboro would provide this service.  The City of Goldsboro has sufficient monies to provide and finance said service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(d) The City of Goldsboro extended garbage collection to the area to be annexed on the date of annexation on substantially the same basis and in the same manner as such services are provided within the rest of the municipality prior to annexation.  Since February 7, 1977, garbage collection has been provided in the 59.25 acre tract by the City of Goldsboro.  The United States of America has provided its own garbage collection service on Seymour Johnson Air Force Base and has not requested the City of Goldsboro to provide said service.  That in the event the United States of America shall cease to provide said service, then the City of Goldsboro would provide this service.  The City of Goldsboro has sufficient monies to provide and finance said service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(e) The City of Goldsboro is providing street maintenance to the area to be annexed and has provided said service since the date of annexation on substantially&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the same basis as that provided within the rest of the municipality.  In said 59.25 acre tract there are several unpaved streets which the City of Goldsboro has repaired and has maintained on substantially the same basis as it has maintained other streets within the City of Goldsboro.  Prior to February 7, 1977, Randolph Street was impassable, and the City of Goldsboro has repaired said street since February 7, 1977.  All of the streets in the 3157 acre tract owned by the United States of America are private ways and have not been dedicated as public streets and as such are not maintained by the City of Goldsboro.  In the event the United States of America dedicated said streets to public use, then the City of Goldsboro would maintain said streets on the same basis as other streets within the City of Goldsboro.  The City of Goldsboro has sufficient monies to provide and finance said service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(f) On February 7, 1977, there existed a water distribution system in the area to be annexed which provides fire protection on substantially the same basis and in the same manner as that provided within the rest of the municipality prior to annexation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(g) On February 7, 1977, the City of Goldsboro&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had located in the area to be annexed major trunk water mains and sewer outfall lines to serve said area on substantially the same basis and in the same manner as such services are provided within the rest of the municipality prior to annexation.  The Petitioner, Charles E. Dail, is not receiving public water or sewer service at the present time since he does not desire either public water or sewer service.  The City of Goldsboro can provide the Petitioner, Charles E. Dail, and other residents of the 59.25 acre tract with public water and sewer service in accordance with uniform policies in existence within the City of Goldsboro.  The residents of the Seymour Johnson Air Force Base are receiving public water and sewer service at the present time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(h) The City of Goldsboro has sufficient revenues or plans for financing the extension of all services in the area to be annexed.  The City of Goldsboro has sufficient revenues to provide all services required under the annexation laws on substantially the same basis and in the same manner as such services are provided within the rest of the municipality prior to annexation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. The area annexed is located on the eastern edge of Goldsboro&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and, on February 7, 1977, there were approximately 1,007 housing structures located on Seymour Johnson Air Force Base and within the 59.25 acre area.  On February 7, 1977, an estimated 8,852 persons resided in the 3,216.25 acre tract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) Within the said annexed area, 3,157 acres are classified as having a governmental purpose or use, that 8,827 persons resided in said area and over 1,000 housing structures are located on Seymour Johnson Air Force Base.  In the 59.25 acre tract, there are seven (7) residential lots comprising 2.44 acres and 29 vacant lots comprising 54.11 acres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) The area annexed was adjacent or contiguous to the City of Goldsboro at the time of annexation within the meaning of G.S. 160A-48 in that the aggregate external boundary of the area to be annexed is 66,343.5 feet of which 10,886 feet (or more than one-eighth) coincided with the City of Goldsboro's boundary prior to annexation.  That 15.9 percent of the aggregate external boundary of the area to be annexed coincided with the boundary of the City of Goldsboro at the time of annexation.  That no part of the area annexed was included within the boundary of another incorporated municipality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(c) The area&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  annexed was developed for urban purposes within the meaning of G.S. 160A-48 in that it had a resident population equal to 2.75 persons for each acre of land included within its boundaries.  There were 8,852 persons residing on 3216.25 acres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(d) The northeastern section of the City of Goldsboro and the surrounding area outside of the corporate limits of the City of Goldsboro (but adjacent to the City of Goldsboro and the area to be annexed) have the largest shopping area in eastern North Carolina and a heavily populated area which requires sound urban development and planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17. The Petitioner, Charles E. Dail, has not presented any evidence that tends to show that he has in any way suffered any material injury by reason of any failure of the City of Goldsboro to comply with procedure set forth in the statute or any failure to meet the requirements set forth in G.S. 160A-48 as they apply to his property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">18. The Petitioner, Hans A. Staps was not present at the trial and presented no evidence, and as a result failed to show that he has in any way suffered any material injury by reason of any failure of the City of Goldsboro to comply with the procedures set forth in the statute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or any failure to meet the requirements set forth in G.S. 160A-48 as they apply to his property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon The Foregoing Findings Of Fact, the Court makes the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. That Part III, Article 4A, of Chapter 160A of the General Statutes of North Carolina, as it applies to the area annexed, does not violate Article 1, Section 1; Article 1, Section 6; Article 1, Section 19; Article 2, Section 1; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Article 5, Section 2 of the Constitution of North Carolina, nor the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. That the Petitioner, Charles E. Dail, as a resident of the 59.25 acre tract, and the Petitioner, Hans A.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Mills, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 12 December 1977 Criminal Session of Davidson Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By an indictment proper in form, defendant was charged with the murder of her sister, Minnie Lee Kiger.  The first attempt to try defendant ended in a mistrial on 3 November 1977.  At her second trial she pled not guilty by reason of insanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 8:30 and 9:00 p.m. on 17 May 1977 the decedent, her son, and her daughter were seated in the living room of their home in Lexington.  Decedent was assisting her daughter with some schoolwork.  A car drove into the driveway in front of the house and decedent went to the window to see who was in the car.  She told the children that defendant was in the car.  After locking the front door, she went out the side door, through the carport, and down the driveway toward defendant's car.  Decedent carried nothing in her hands.  The two children watched from the house's front window as their mother approached to within four or five feet of the car.  At that point, defendant stepped out, shot decedent several times with a small rifle and then fled in a yellow car.  The children summoned neighbors&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and police to assist their mother.  Both children identified the defendant at trial and testified she was the assailant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A member of the Davidson County Sheriff's Department testified concerning statements given to him by the two children on the night of the incident, both of which corroborated their testimony at trial.  A second member of the sheriff's department testified that he arrested the defendant, who owned a yellow car, on the basis of these statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of the state's evidence, the parties stipulated that decedent's death resulted from multiple gunshot wounds.  Defendant then moved for dismissal on the ground that the state had failed to prove her sanity.  This motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant did not testify; nor did she offer any evidence tending to contradict the state's version of the events culminating in the death of Minnie Lee Kiger.  Evidence offered for the defendant related solely to the issue of sanity and tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant had a history of mental illness dating back to 1967.  At the request of her mother, defendant, in March, 1972, had been committed to Dorothea Dix Hospital for several weeks.  On that occasion she had wandered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  away from home and had attacked her mother.  After the shooting death of her sister defendant was again committed to Dorothea Dix Hospital for observation.  Two expert psychiatrists who examined her testified that she was incapable of knowing right from wrong at the time of the shooting, that she suffered various delusions -- among them, the belief that God had directed the killing of her sister, and that her thought processes were irrational.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state offered no rebuttal of the testimony concerning insanity.  The experts were cross-examined, however.  The first of them testified on cross-examination that defendant understood the charges against her and could aid her attorney in preparing her defense.  He further testified that &quot;circumstances could arise that she would again assault somebody and that could result in death.&quot; The second expert was questioned about the length of time in which he had observed defendant; he stated that he interviewed her for 45 minutes in jail after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of all the evidence defendant again moved for dismissal, which was denied.  Following arguments and instructions to the jury, defendant moved for a mistrial.  This motion was also&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  denied.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty of first-degree murder and from judgment imposing a life sentence of imprisonment, defendant appeals.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Davidson County Superior Court (North Carolina) that convicted her of first-degree murder and sentenced her to life imprisonment. Defendant's motions for dismissal and for a mistrial were denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant arrived at the home of the victim, who was defendant's sister, and as the victim met her in the driveway, defendant shot her several times with a rifle. Defendant fled in her car. The victim's children witnessed the shooting. Defendant had a history of mental illness, and two experts testified that she was incapable of knowing right from wrong at the time of the shooting and that she suffered from a delusion that God had directed the killing. On appeal, the court ruled that: (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by not permitting her counsel to ask each prospective juror, rather than the entire panel, whether the juror would be willing to return a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity; (2) she was not improperly denied 14 peremptory challenges because the State did not seek the death penalty; (3) the trial court erred when, after defendant had exhausted her peremptory challenges, it denied her motion to excuse for cause three prospective jurors who indicated that they were not willing to return a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, even though her insanity was proven to them; and (4) the trial court's jury instructions on insanity were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Mecklenburg County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted him of armed robbery and sentenced him to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and an accomplice entered a motel office. When defendant brandished a sawed-off rifle and demanded money, the wife of the motel's owner activated a silent alarm. After receiving money, the men fled in a car, and a high-speed chase ensued when it did not stop for a police officer responding to the alarm. The car later came to stop and the occupants fled on foot. Many other police cars responded to the scene and one car struck defendant's car. A saw-off rifle was seized from the car. Defendant was arrested by another officer who saw defendant near where the car had been abandoned. On appeal, the court ruled that the rifle was properly admitted into evidence under the plain view doctrine. Although it was unclear whether the car door was left open by the occupants as they fled or because of the collision with a police car, there was nothing in the record that suggested that the collision was a subterfuge designed by the officers to get at the contents of the car. Because defendant's arrest was lawful, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-401(b)(2), the chasing-officer's identification of defendant at a show-up, and the wife's line-up identification of him, were properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried and convicted of the possession with intent to sell methylenedioxy amphetamine (MDA), a controlled substance, and of the sale and delivery of MDA on 27 February 1975.  From sentences imposed, defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals.  That court found no error in the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tended to show that on the night of 27 February 1975, R. T.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified and offered evidence by family members and employees of Carolina Fire Equipment Sales &amp; Service, Inc., his place of employment.

Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in allowing the district attorney to cross-examine him regarding drugs found in his home during a prior unrelated search. Defendant maintained that the admission of the evidence was a violation of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule. The court held that the exclusionary rule did not apply to defendant's case because there was nothing to indicate in the record that the prior unrelated search of defendant's home was declared unlawful for constitutional reasons. The exclusionary rule did not apply when there was a violation of the statutory procedures regulating searches and seizures, unless there was a substantial violation, and the record gave no such indication. The cross-examination of defendant for impeachment purposes regarding his prior unrelated convictions and acts of misconduct was proper because the trial court instructed the jury that it was limited to defendant's credibility as a witness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant complained that the State was permitted to &quot;impeach&quot; its witness by asking him leading questions. The court held that there was no attempt by the State to discredit any testimony that that witness gave after being recalled from an out-of-court conference with the district attorney. The jury was fully apprised of the fact of the conference and the manner in which the witness gave his testimony. Several leading questions were permitted. However, most of the questions were not leading, and the trial court was alert to sustain an objection to a question that it deemed to be unnecessarily leading. Defendant argued that a remark made by the trial court during his cross-examination of a State's witness was error. The court held that there was nothing to suggest the trial court improperly sustained the district attorney's objection or that he was unnecessarily harsh in instructing defense counsel to let the witness finish his answer. Defendant argued that the instructions employed an unconstitutional presumption of malice and unlawfulness. The court held that there was no merit in that contention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants from their conviction of first degree murder in a trial before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Tillery, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 18 August 1975 Session of Wilson Superior Court.  The case was docketed and argued as Case No. 2 at the Fall Term 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Mayo owned and operated the Spur Go Shop, a Spur gasoline service station on South Goldsboro Street in Wilson, North Carolina.  The entire front of the building, including both corners, is clear glass except for the clapboard just below the roof and about two feet of brick construction just above the ground.  The two swinging doors which afforded entrance to the service station are entirely glass.  In addition to gasoline, Mayo also carried a small stock of groceries and other items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayo was shot during the course of an armed robbery at his station on the night of 11 February 1975.  He died one month later as a result of his wound.  Defendants William Matthews (Matthews) and Victor Foust (Foust) and two other black youths, Ronnie Lee Matthews and Lawrence Matthews, were charged with the armed robbery in warrants issued on 12 February 1975.  New warrants were issued on 12 March 1975 charging them with the murder of Mayo.  They were rearrested on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  13 March 1975.  True bills of indictment were returned against the four at the May 1975 Session of the Wilson Superior Court.  Defendants Matthews and Foust were first tried at the 7 July Session.  The jury was unable to agree upon a verdict and a mistrial was declared on 20 July 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To properly evaluate the testimony of the State's witnesses it is necessary to locate the Spur station with reference to its surroundings.  The record indicates that Goldsboro Street runs north and south, and the Spurstation is located on the west side, where Bank Street intersects Goldsboro, immediately south of the tracks of the Norfolk and Southern Railroad.  Banks Street is discontinuous at Goldsboro, the western segment being on the south side of the railroad tracks and the eastern segment on the north side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linwood Williams (Williams), who was working for Mayo as a station attendant on the night of the robbery, testified in brief summary as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 8:30 p.m. a solid green 1965 Cadillac, with pink carpet trim around the rear window and covering the rear deck behind the back seat, drove up to the station.  Four young black men got out and entered the station.  One of them asked for &quot;directions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to a woman's house on Spruce Street&quot;; Mayo told them how to get to Spruce Street and all four left.  Something about the men aroused Mayo's suspicions and he noted the license number of the Cadillac on a pad by the cash register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that night, about 10:30 or 10:45 p.m., Mayo was behind the counter putting up cigarettes and Williams was standing at the corner of the door in front of the cash register talking to him, when four black youths arrived at the station on foot.  The two who entered first (later identified by Williams as defendants Matthews and Foust) went to the &quot;display island&quot; to the left of the door.  There they had a whispered conversation while Mayo and Williams continued to talk.  A minute or so later the other two (whom Williams could not identify as Ronnie and Lawrence Matthews) entered the station and purchased a box of matches from Mayo.  Thereafter, Matthews came toward Williams, pulled a gun from his shirt, and &quot;leaned up against&quot; Williams, pushing him against the entrance door so that he could not move.  At that moment Williams heard Foust coming up behind him and he saw the other two move to the end of the counter.  Matthews aimed his gun across the counter&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at Mayo and told him &quot;to hand the money over.&quot; Instead, Mayo stepped back and attempted to pull his own gun.  The two youths standing near him (allegedly Lawrence Matthews and Ronnie Matthews) disarmed Mayo in a brief scuffle and knocked him to his knees on the floor.  William Matthews called out, &quot;Shoot him, shoot him!&quot; whereupon one of them shot Mayo in the back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams could not testify who fired the shot because, he said, &quot;once he [Matthews] pulled that pistol out, I kept my eyes fastened on it.  . . . I'm still staring at that pistol while he is aiming it at Mr. Mayo.&quot; Immediately after he was shot one of the four began to search the prostrate Mayo.  Matthews told Wiliams to hand over his wallet (which contained six dollars), and Williams handed it to him.  Matthews then took forty to fifty dollars, money collected that evening from customers, from Williams' shirt pocket.  Matthews then tried to open the cash register, failed, and ordered Williams to open it.  All four then took money from the register.  Three of the robbers then left; the fourth, Matthews, threw his gun in Mayo's face and asked where the rest of the money was.  When Mayo did not respond Matthews also left. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Williams observed the three men run across Goldsboro Street and through the yard at 715 S. Goldsboro Street directly opposite the gas pumps of the Spur station.  They crossed the railroad tracks and then &quot;catercornered through that weight scale yard there.  From there they went on the other side of that warehouse across the street.&quot; When Matthews left he ran in the same direction as the other three.  All four recrossed Goldsboro Street at the B. J. High Home Improvement Company just north of the railroad tracks, and &quot;disappeared behind the Spur Station.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective R. H. Broadwell was the first to arrive at the Spur station.  At that time he spoke briefly with Williams, who was &quot;highly nervous&quot; and very pale.  The detective could &quot;make no sense out of what he was saying.  He was just talking in riddles.&quot; Williams did, however, give Broadwell the license number of the green Cadillac, from which it was ascertained that the car belonged to Ronnie Matthews, Chestnut Street, Greenville, North Carolina.  Broadwell then alerted the Greenville police to be on the lookout &quot;for four blacks in a green Cadillac&quot;; that there was reason to believe &quot;it might be connected with the shooting and robbery&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at the Spur station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony of William Branch, aged 17, who drove into Mayo's service station around 10:35 or 10:40 p.m. on the night of the robbery tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After parking his car at the self-service pump, Branch went into the station and prepaid three dollars for gasoline.  He exchanged greetings with Mayo and observed the presence of Williams and four black men.  Two were standing in front of the beer cooler.  Another was standing by Williams, and the fourth was at the end of the counter.  The latter two he later identified as defendants Matthews and Foust.  Branch returned to his car, unfastened the gas cap and picked up the hose.  When he turned toward the station to signal Mayo to turn on the pump he saw him down on his hands and knees.  Sensing trouble, Branch got into his car and drove south on Goldsboro Street.  He described his activities thereafter as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went down about a block away to White's Tire Service where I stopped and parked my car.  I got out and walked across the street to New Planters Warehouse No. 2, mainly so I could see if I could see into the station from that corner of the warehouse there.&quot; Branch then returned to his car and drove&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  north on Goldsboro Street, toward the Spur station.  He said he was in front of Exclusive Cleaners when &quot;three black guys&quot; ran across the street in front of the station.  He then pulled into the station lot.  Upon seeing that Mr. Mayo had been shot he pulled back out of the station lot onto Goldsboro Street and was headed north when his headlights hit Matthews in the face.  Matthews was &quot;maybe 25 feet away,&quot; running across the street from B. J. High, right across the street from Statewide Scale Company.  He was headed east down Banks Street on the north side of the railroad.  Branch returned to the station.  There he found Williams upset and silent, &quot;like he was in a daze or in shock.&quot; Since no one else was at the station he waited until the Police and Rescue Squad arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Ellis, who was driving south on Goldsboro Street around 10:45 p.m. on 11 February 1975, testified in brief summary as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had slowed down for the railroad tracks and was traveling 20-25 MPH when he glanced to his right into the Spur station.  Inside he saw four black men.  One was behind the counter moving from one end to the other.  Another was standing by Mr. Williams, who was standing over next&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the wall against the storage room door.  This scene struck Ellis as &quot;sort of suspicious.&quot; He went on by, turned around, and started back toward the station.  When he came abreast of the vacant lot adjoining the Spur station on the south, he saw three of the black males cross the street, running very fast.  These men he could not identify.  He drove on by the station, and just as he crossed the railroad track another one ran across the street in front of his car.  He was so close that Ellis had to stop to keep from hitting him.  When asked if he saw that man in the courtroom Ellis pointed and said, &quot;Yes, sir, the defendant Matthews.&quot; After that Ellis saw the defendant Matthews and the other three running down Banks Street and disappear.  In a few minutes he returned to the station as the police were driving up.  He went in and saw Mr. Mayo on the floor behind the counter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence further tends to show that the Wilson police received information that the Greenville police had picked up some individuals who might have been connected with Wilson's &quot;shooting and robbery.&quot; About 1:00 a.m. that same night, Detective Broadwell and another officer tooks Williams, Branch, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ellis to the police department in Greenville.  There the three witnesses were taken into a darkened room from which they could look through a one-way glass into a well-lighted room where they saw four black men and a uniformed officer.  Broadwell testified, &quot;I told the fellows, 'Look in there and see if you see anybody you have seen before.' I said, 'Take your time, we've got plenty of time,' and they did.&quot; The testimony of each of the three witnesses with reference to this episode is summarized below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams' version: When the police called him &quot;they said they had picked up four blacks in a green Cadillac and wanted [him] to identify them.&quot; Upon arrival at the police station in Greenville, Williams noticed in the parking lot a green Cadillac with &quot;pink carpet in the back glass.&quot; It was the same vehicle he had seen about 8:30 p.m. at the Spur station in Wilson.  After looking at the four men in the lighted room he positively identified two of them as defendants Matthews and Foust.  However, he could not identify Ronnie Matthews or Lawrence Matthews (both of whom were present in court) as the other two men who were in the Spur station at the time of the robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Williams conceded that at the first trial he might have identified Ronnie and Lawrence Matthews as the other two men but said he was confused at that time.  He would not identify them now.  On redirect examination he said that there was no doubt at all in his mind that Matthews and Foust were two of the four men who robbed the station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branch's version: &quot;Later on that night&quot; Detective Broadwell called Branch's father and told him that &quot;they had a lineup of some people at Greenville.&quot; The detective said that he wanted to take Branch along with Williams and Ellis to Greenville to see if they could identify anyone they had seen at Mayo's Spur station.  Upon arrival at the police station Branch did not see any green Cadillac, but he did see one when he left.  Inside the station they were escorted to a room in which there was a &quot;one-way mirror&quot; and told to look in it to see if they could identify anybody.  After about 15 minutes Branch was asked if he &quot;noticed&quot; anybody, and he pointed out Matthews and Foust as two of the four men he had seen at the Spur station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With reference to Ronnie and Lawrence Matthews, Branch said, &quot;I've seen both of them in court before.  They were in the room&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at Greenville and they were in court today.  I can't say, though, that they were the other two that were in the Spur station that night.  They were standing in front of that refrigeration unit in the back, so I didn't get a good look at them.  I can't identify them for sure.&quot; Branch contended that at the first trial he had said the same thing, that he could not be sure Ronnie and Lawrence Matthews were the other two in the station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Ellis testified before the jury neither the State's attorney nor defense counsel asked him any questions about his trip to Greenville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Broadwell testified that after Williams, Branch and Ellis had viewed the four men at Greenville, &quot;Linwood Wiliams identified Victor Foust . . ., and Bill Branch and Linwood Williams identified Lawrence Matthews . . . Williams and Ellis identified William Earl Matthews to me, but nobody identified Ronnie Matthews.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, before the introduction of any evidence, and in the absence of the jury, Judge Tillery heard defendants' motion to suppress all testimony from Williams, Branch and Ellis which tended to identify Matthews and Foust as two of the four men who were engaged in robbing Mayo's Spur&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  station.  At this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the testimony of Williams, Branch, and Ellis was substantially the same as that later given before the jury.  In the main, it differed only in that a few details supplied in one were omitted in the other.  For instance, on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Williams told the judge that while the four men were in the station for the second time Branch came in and laid down money for gas from the self-service pump and went out just before the robbery.  However, he did not mention this incident in his testimony to the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Williams said that before going to Greenville, Broadwell told him he wanted him &quot;to go over there and see if the four [men] and the green Cadillac were the same ones who came there.&quot; Further, he told Judge Tillery that the four men who robbed the station were in the building from 12-15 minutes; that there was &quot;plently of light in the station&quot;; that Foust had been standing at the end of the counter on which Williams was leaning; that he had not only observed Matthews but he had looked into his face as he came toward him with the pistol; that thereafter he kept his eyes on the gun as Matthews leaned against him, pinning him against&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the door, that as Matthews advanced upon him he saw that Foust moved in behind.  He knew, therefore, that it was neither Matthews nor Foust who attacked Mayo behind the counter.  However, it was Matthews who told one of the other two men behind the counter to shoot Mayo.  It was also Matthews who threatened to shoot Williams if he did not hand over his wallet, and it was Matthews to whom he handed it.  Williams insisted, therefore, that he had correctly identified Matthews and Foust in Greenville as two of the men who robbed the Spur station and that he would have identified them in court had he not seen them in Greenville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams was also positive that the four men who robbed the station were the same four men who came there in the green Cadillac at 8:30 p.m. In explanation of his inability to say whether Ronnie and Lawrence Matthews were the &quot;other two&quot; Wiliams said his glasses needed cleaning; that he had become very upset when he saw Matthews aim the pistol at him, and more upset after Mayo was shot; that he became highly agitated, nervous and confused, this condition lasting several weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Williams said he believed the last man to leave the station was the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  one who bent over Mayo with a gun and told him &quot;he was going to finish him off if he didn't tell him where the other money was,&quot; but he didn't know.  However, he told the jury that &quot;William Earl Matthews was the one who got left behind when the three fled together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Branch testified that when he looked into the station to see if Mayo had turned on the pump, he saw Mayo looking at him.  He said he also saw defendants Matthews and Foust.  &quot;One of them had a gun or something at Mr. Williams&quot; and the other was standing up beside the counter, and that's when he left.  These statements were omitted from his testimony before the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the way to Greenville, Branch said Broadwell told them they were going to Greenville for a lineup to identify the people they saw in Wilson at the Spur station at the time of the shooting.  However, he futher testified, &quot;No, no one at the station told me that they had a license number of a green Cadillac.  I didn't know anything about a green Cadillac.  I didn't see one when I got to Greenville.  . . . No, there was no discussion about a green Cadillac on the way to Greenville.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After viewing the four men in Greenville, Branch told Broadwell&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he believed that Ronnie and Lawrence Matthews were the two men he saw standing at the refrigerator when he went into the Spur station to pay for gas.  However, he could not be positive because he did not see them face to face as he had seen defendants Matthews and Foust.  Matthews had a scar on his face and Foust had certain facial hair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ellis' account of seeing the four men in the Spur station and in flight thereafter did not differ from his account on direct examination.  It did, however, include the following testimony which was not adduced before the jury: After the men had fled he returned to the station.  The police had arrived and he &quot;heard some people talking about it&quot; (the green Cadillac), and &quot;someone said they had the license number.&quot; However, nobody mentioned it to him.  He went home where he later received a call from Detective Broadwell, who told him they had picked up four guys in a green Cadillac in Greenville.  &quot;He didn't say the four guys; he just said they had four guys,&quot; and he wanted Ellis to go see if he had seen them in Wilson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Greenville, Ellis and the others viewed four black men from the small dark room with the one-way mirror.  After&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  looking at the suspects, the witnesses entered the room with them and Ellis got just a few feet from them.  It took him just a few seconds to identify Matthews, but Matthews was the only one he could identify.  He said he had no problem identifying Matthews in Greenville because he had seen him crossing in front of him on Goldsboro Street; that nobody suggested to him in any way that he should identify him; and that he &quot;could identify him today in court even if [he] had not seen him in Greenville.&quot; On cross-examination Ellis reiterated that he was sure that his identification now had nothing to do with his identification in Greenville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> testimony, the trial judge made findings of fact in substantial conformity to the above outlined testimony and then concluded as a matter of law, &quot;that the in-court identification of the defendants Matthews and Foust by Williams and Branch and Matthews by Ellis was of independent origin and not tainted by any illegal pre-trial identification procedure.&quot; Judge Tillery further concluded: &quot;[T]he totality of the circumstances does not reveal pretrial procedures so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  mistaken identification as to offend fundamental standards of decency, fairness and justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, all three witnesses were allowed to identify defendants at trial and were also allowed to testify as to their identification at the Greenville lineup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense presented extensive testimony which tended to establish an alibi for each of the defendants, as well as for Lawrence and Ronnie Matthews, who were then also charged with murder. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William Earl Matthews (defendant) is the first cousin of Lawrence and Ronnie Matthews, who are brothers.  All three live in Greenville in a big, two-story house belonging to Annie Matthews, their grandmother.  Eleven or twelve other members of the Matthews family representing five generations, also live there.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;On 1 December 1977, pursuant to G.S. 15A-931, the District Attorney dismissed the indictment charging Ronnie and Lawrence Matthews with the murder of Donald Mayo.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to defendant Matthews he played basketball on the afternoon of 11 February 1975.  Around 6:00 p.m. he met his cousin Ronnie, who drives a green 1965 Cadillac with pink carpet trim in the back.  Ronnie gave him and Victor Foust a ride to the Matthews home. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (Foust was temporarily staying there, visiting Patricia Matthews, his girl friend.) Defendant Matthews ate, bathed, and watched television with other members of the family.  He testified as to the programs he saw.  According to Matthews, Victor Foust went out with Patricia at 10:00 p.m. to buy beer and returned shortly thereafter.  Lawrence Matthews came home at 11:00 p.m. from his job at Fieldcrest Mills.  Defendant Matthews stopped working at Fieldcrest in November and had been doing &quot;part time&quot; work since then.  He was not working on February 11th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 11:00 defendant Matthews and Lawrence went upstairs to bed.  Shortly thereafter, Ronnie returned home and announced to them that he had been to Wilson with Charles Norfleet, Tyrone Dixon and &quot;Boots.&quot; All three, defendant Matthews, Ronnie and Lawrence, then fell asleep.  They were awakened later by the arrival of the police.  When Sergeant Laughinghouse of the Wilson police asked Ronnie to go with him to the police station, defendant Matthews, Foust, and Lawrence also volunteered to go.  Thereafter Foust changed his mind, but when the Sergeant asked, &quot;Do you need any help?&quot; he replied, &quot;No, man, I'm coming,&quot; and the three went. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On direct examination, in response to specific questions from his counsel, defendant Matthews said that his hair was the same as it was on February 11th.  &quot;The scar on my nose was there then.  It's right there.  . . . I have been convicted of breaking and entering in 1971.  I have not been convicted of anything else.  I have a tattoo on my face.  It is right there [left corner of his mouth].  I put it on when I was in prison in 1972. That was the breaking and entering thing I talked about.&quot; On cross-examination he said he &quot;went to training school for not going to school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various members of defendant Matthews' family, including his grandparents, Annie and Thurman Matthews, confirmed his account.  Mrs. Matthews, however, testified that Foust never volunteered to go to the police station.  On the contrary, he refused to go until she told him &quot;to go ahead, to keep down trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In brief summary Victor Foust testified in his own behalf as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The week before Christmas 1974 he had come to Greenville, the home of his family, from Washington, D.C., where he had been employed as a machinist.  He worked for one employer two months and for another, seven and one-half months.  On&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  11 February 1975 he was unemployed and, since the first week after New Year's, registered at the unemployment office in Greenville.  He has never at any time been to a Spur station in Wilson.  On February 11th he met Ronnie Matthews around 5:30 p.m. and solicited a ride to Ronnie's home in Ronnie's Cadillac.  There, Victor watched television with his girl friend, Patricia Matthews.  Around 10:00 p.m. they went out to the &quot;Pak-A-Sak&quot; and bought some malt liquor and soda.  On the way back they saw one Marvin Adams, his wife, and an elderly woman.  Pleasantries were exchanged, and Victor and Patricia returned to the Matthews' house, where they continued to watch television until the police arrived.  Marvin Adams corroborated Foust's version of his encounter with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Sergeant asked the others if they would accompany him to the police station Foust volunteered to go too but then, he said, &quot;[W]hen it dawned on me, you know, by past experience about the Greenville Police Department, I changed my mind.&quot; However, when the officers asked him if he &quot;needed any help&quot; he went along.  His previous convictions had been for breach of peace, &quot;disorderly conduct, you know, misdemeanors, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a couple of traffic violations.&quot; Foust had a scar &quot;right across [his] right eye and between [his] eyes,&quot; which he said he had had since he was 13 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After &quot;the people from Wilson&quot; had viewed the group whom the officers had assembled, Foust was retained in jail overnight and was served with a warrant about 9:00 the next morning, Wednesday, February 12th.  He was released on Saturday, February 15th.  In March he was charged with the murder of Mayo and rearrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronnie Lee Matthews, 19 years of age, testified that although the title to the vehicle was in his mother's name he was the real owner of the green Cadillac with pink rug trim in the rear.  On February 11th, between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m., he said he saw his first cousin, William Matthews, on the street and took him home.  Thereafter, at the request of Charles Norfleet, Ronnie drove to Wilson with his friends, Robert Moore, Tyrone Dixon, and Charles Norfleet.  They arrived around 8:30 p.m.; after being misdirected several times they went to a Spur station to get directions to Spruce Street.  Charles Norfleet wanted to see a girl named Nell, who lived there.  A fat man behind the counter gave them directions to Spruce&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Street.  (According to Detective Broadwell Mr. Mayo &quot;would weigh 400 pounds.&quot;) While at the station Ronnie Matthews bought a carton of orange juice.  The others bought something to eat, and Tyrone Dixon and Charles Norfleet used the rest room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group left the station about 9:00 p.m. Although they found Spruce Street they could not find the home of Nell; so they returned to Greenville, arriving around 10:00 p.m. Ronnie Matthews let his friends out and went to visit his girl friend.  Around 11:00 p.m. he, his girl friend, and Robert Moore drove to the Fieldcrest Mills to pick up James Dixon who was getting off work.  Ronnie then went home.  Neither William Matthews nor Victor Foust went with Ronnie to Wilson on the night of February 11th.  His story was corroborated by Tyrone Dixon, Robert Moore, Charles Norfleet, James Dixon, Nell Pender, Phyllis Foreman (his girl friend), her sister, Lou Gail Foreman, and her boy friend, Melvin Roberson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawrence Matthews testified that he worked two shifts at Fieldcrest Mills that day, getting off one hour early at 10:00 p.m. He took two friends home and then went to his own house.  His story was confirmed by his supervisor, William Manning, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  several co-workers, and the guard at the mill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to both defendants, William Matthews and Victor Foust, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree.  Upon these verdicts, under the law then applicable, Judge Tillery entered the mandatory sentences of death.  Defendants' appeal was not timely perfected.  We allowed certiorari on 27 January 1976, and the appeal was docketed 18 June 1976.  </SPAN></P>

They appealed from their convictions, arguing that it was error for the trial court to deny their motion for change of venue. The court affirmed, holding that defendants failed to show prejudicial error requiring a new trial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to change the venue because the fact that defendants were black and the victim was white was mere happenstance and not per se grounds for a change of venue. Defendants made no attempt at trial, or prior thereto, to show that there existed any prejudice which might have deprived them of a fair and impartial jury, and the record suggested no such prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant appeals from judgments of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Browning, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 3 October 1977 Session, Pitt Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in separate bills of indictment, consolidated for trial, with (1) felonious breaking or entering of the Patrick and Joyce Barfield residence, located at Route 3, Stokes, North Carolina, with intent to commit rape therein, (2) crime against nature with Joyce Barfield and (3) first degree rape of Joyce Barfield, all on 3 May 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that on 3 May 1977 Patrick Barfield left home for work at 6:25 a.m. and saw defendant Richardson on the edge of the parking lot at Roebuck and Parker's Store walking toward Mr. Barfield's home.  He had seen defendant several times in and around Stokes and recognized him on this occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Joyce Barfield heard her dog barking shortly after her husband left and looked out the window of her bedroom but did not see anything.  In a few moments she heard a thump on the front porch, then steps in the living room, and then saw a man with a stocking tied around his face and with a gun in his hand pointed at the ceiling.  The stocking he wore on his face was thick like a support hose but the area above the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tip of his nose, including his eyes and a portion of his forehead and part of his hair, was not covered by the stocking.  After closing the door to the children's bedroom, the intruder pushed Mrs. Barfield down on the bed, put the gun barrel between her eyes and said he was going to kill her and the children unless she behaved and cooperated.  He then forced her to have oral sex with him after which he raped her and left.  Her assailant was a white male who appeared to be about her husband's height and was wearing dirty off-white leather gloves, an off-white suit and a dark shirt with a paisley print on it.  After his departure Mrs. Barfield called her husband and officers were alerted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was picked up at 11:30 a.m. on the same day, advised of his rights, and agreed to talk with the officers.  He denied committing the crimes and voluntarily permitted the deputies to search his residence.  They did so and confiscated a pair of pants and a coat which Mrs. Barfield later identified as garments worn by the man who assaulted her.  At 2 p.m. on the same day, after again being warned of his constitutional rights and waiving them, defendant made another statement denying all culpability. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At 6:30 p.m. the same day, after again being warned of his rights and waiving them, defendant agreed to stand in a lineup and was positively identified by Mrs. Barfield as the man who raped her.  After the lineup he was questioned again, and this time he admitted seeing Mrs. Barfield's husband leave for work and stated that he then went to the Barfield home with a toy pistol in hand and a stocking over his head and raped Mrs. Barfield after forcing her to commit oral sex upon him.  He described in detail the Barfield house and the acts which took place.  He said he entered through the front door which was unlocked.  He took the officers to a place where he said he had thrown the &quot;toy&quot; gun and the stocking, but these items were not found.  At 1 p.m. the following afternoon, defendant confessed again and led deputies in a search for the gun but it was never found.  He consented to a search of his toolbox in which a pair of gloves was found and later identified by Mrs. Barfield as the gloves defendant wore when he entered her home and raped her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified in his own behalf.  His testimony tends to show that on the morning of 3 May 1977 he first arose at 6 a.m. but laid back&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  down and finally got up at 7:15 a.m. He talked to Mr. Carter Crandall on his CB radio at about 7:15 a.m. or 7:20 a.m. and then left his home for work at approximately 7:45 a.m. He walked to the post office in Stokes where he mailed a letter, then rode with Stan Cherry in his truck to Crandall's Grocery, stopping on the way to purchase pipe tobacco at Roebuck and Parker's Store.  He got out of the Cherry vehicle at Clark Crandall's Store about 8:10 a.m. and thereafter worked for Mr. Crandall until he was first approached by police officers at 11:30 a.m. Defendant denied entering the Barfield home, raping or otherwise molesting Mrs. Barfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to his various confessions, oral and written, defendant said: &quot;The first statement that I made that was written down . . . is not what happened.  I signed it out of impulse.  . . . I came up with the idea that it was a toy pistol, I was taking a wild guess.  I just said it was a toy gun.  I did not come up with the idea about putting the stocking over my face.  I don't remember if I drew a picture of this pistol for Deputy Sheriff Moye.  I don't remember how in the world I drew a picture of the pistol I used in the commission of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  crime when I don't even have the pistol.  I can't tell you whether State's Exhibit 8 is the floor plan of the house that I drew.  I guess that I drew one.  . . . I had already gotten nervous and shook up.  I have hypertension.  . . . I carried them out there to try to help them find that gun and stockings on two different times.  . . . I was pretty well scared already.  It was my hypertension.  . . . I do not rape women.  . . . I further signed saying that no one had made me any threat or forced me into signing these statements and no one had offered me any reward or hope of reward for making the statement.  That was the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant emphasized that he made the various confessions and signed them because he was tired and hungry.  He denied knowing Mrs. Barfield or knowing where she lived.  He said he told the sheriff that Mr. Barfield was wearing a cowbody hat that morning because he had seen the man once before at Mr. Crandall's Store and he was wearing his cowboy hat.  Defendant said he was twenty-nine years of age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stan Cherry testified that he picked up defendant at the post office at approximately 8 a.m., stopped at Roebuck and Parker's so defendant could get some tobacco, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and then carried him to Crandall's Store, arriving there at 8:10 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carter Crandall testified that the first conversation he had with defendant on the CB that morning was at 7:20 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cecil Crandall testified that defendant worked for him from 8:10 a.m. until he was picked up by the police at 11:30 a.m. on the morning of 3 May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's rebuttal evidence tends to show that, in his confession, defendant described the Barfield house and its surroundings in detail and drew a diagram (State's Exhibit 8) accurately depicting the floor plan.  He told the officers how to get to the Barfield house and described a certain Pepsi-Cola sign, an &quot;old timey&quot; well, a fake well in the front yard, and the screen porch on the house.  He told about a garden and an open field and a thick woodland on one side.  All these references were very accurate.  He also told the officers about a dog and there was a dog there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State's evidence on rebuttal further tends to show that it takes sixteen minutes to walk from the Barfield house to defendant's house by the longest route.  Taking available shortcuts, the distance between the two houses may be traversed in much less time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  guilty as charged in each case.  He was sentenced to life imprisonment for the rape, ten years for crime against nature and ten years for felonious breaking or entering, to run consecutively.  Defendant appealed the life sentence to the Supreme Court, and we allowed motion to bypass the Court of Appeals in the other two cases to the end that initial appellate review be afforded in all cases by this Court.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order from the Pitt Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted him of felonious breaking and entering, committing a crime against nature, and first-degree rape. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the rape, 10 years imprisonment for the crime against nature, and 10 years imprisonment for felonious breaking and entering, to run consecutively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of felonious breaking and entering, committing a crime against nature, and first-degree rape. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for the rape, 10 years imprisonment for the crime against nature, and 10 years imprisonment for felonious breaking and entering, to run consecutively. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences, finding that his confessions were not obtained as the result of a violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-501. All evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that the confessions were admissible. No error was committed by admitting the confessions into evidence. The court further found that drawings and statements made by defendant were admissible for impeachment purposes. The record did not indicate that defendant objected to the impeaching use of his statements and drawings on the ground that they were coerced or otherwise induced by improper means. Defendant did not request a voir dire hearing to determine whether the statements and drawings were coerced. Neither defendant's testimony nor any other evidence suggested that the statements and drawings were induced by force, threat, fear, or promise of reward.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order convicting defendant of felonious breaking and entering, committing a crime against nature, and first-degree rape was affirmed. Defendant's sentences were also affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants contended the trial court erred in admitting the sawed-off shotgun and other items of evidence taken from defendants' automobile because those items were unconstitutionally seized. The trial court concluded that probable cause existed to search the automobile at the police station and that the search was neither unreasonable nor conducted in violation of defendants' constitutional rights. Defendants argued that their pre-trial appearance bonds were so unreasonably high as to violate their constitutional prohibition against &quot;excessive bail.&quot; N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 27. Defendants were charged with armed robbery, in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-87, which at the time provided for imprisonment for not less than five years nor more than life imprisonment in the state's prison upon conviction. While defendants alleged that they and their families were &quot;persons of very modest means,&quot; they also stated their intention to obtain expert assistance at their own expense if released. Because of defendants' prior convictions and because bail was twice reduced, the court held that no prejudicial error appeared in the trial court's denial of defendants' motion for reduction of bail.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McLelland, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 27 September 1976 Session of Wake Superior Court, docketed and argued as Case No. 103 at the Spring Term 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged by indictments with kidnapping, Case No. 76CR27995, robbery with a dangerous weapon, Case No. 76CR27432-A, assault on a female with intent to commit rape, Case No. 76CR27432-B, and crime against nature, Case No. 76CR27432-C.  The State's evidence tends to show that Lucille Wesley, aged 21, arrived at the Raleigh Greyhound Bus Terminal at about 3:30 a.m. on 7 July 1976.  She was a resident of Bishopville, South Carolina, and was en route to Wendell, North Carolina, to visit relatives.  After calling her relatives to notify them of her arrival, Miss Wesley returned to the lobby of the bus terminal and began to read a paperback book.  She felt uncomfortable and went into the lobby of the women's restroom to continue her reading.  However, just as she sat down, a man whom she had never seen before (later identified by her as defendant) burst into the restroom.  He began to ask her personal questions, and when she attempted to leave, he pushed her back into the chair.  Miss Wesley managed to get up and start&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the door, but defendant blocked her, pushed her against the wall and started to kiss her.  When she attempted to get away from him, defendant produced a knife and forced her to go to the last of the stalls in the restroom where he ordered her to disrobe.  After she had partially disrobed, he forced her to sit on the commode and rubbed his private parts against hers, fondled her with his hands and then forced her to perform oral sex.  Thereafter, he demanded and received two dollars from her.  After warning her not to follow him, he left.  Shortly after defendant departed, Miss Wesley told an employee of the bus terminal that she had been attacked while in the restroom of the terminal.  He called the police, and after she told the officers what had happened, she was then taken to Wake Memorial Hospital where she received medical attention.  Miss Wesley testified that she did not go into the stall in the restroom willingly, she did not submit to any of the acts she described willingly, or give defendant money willingly or voluntarily.  She submitted to all of the defendant's demands because she feared he would harm her with the knife which he displayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State also offered testimony&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of police officers who testified that Miss Wesley gave them a detailed description of defendant and the clothing worn by him.  Defendant was apprehended at about 4:30 a.m. about ten blocks from the bus terminal.  His clothing matched the description given by the victim.  He was carrying a knife, and there were two one dollar bills in his shirt pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was expert testimony to the effect that fingerprints &quot;lifted&quot; from a chair in the lobby of the women's restroom at the Greyhound Bus Terminal matched fingerprints taken from defendant after he was placed in custody.  Further, a newspaper carrier, who had known defendant for several years, testified that he observed defendant run from the Greyhound Bus Terminal during the early morning hours of 7 June 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered Ronnie McCullers and Mickey Wilson as his only witnesses.  McCullers testified that Lucille Wesley solicited him to engage in sex for pay and suggested that the act be consummated in the women's restroom of the bus terminal.  He later saw her talking to defendant in the main lobby of the bus terminal.  Wilson testified that he saw Lucille Wesley talking with defendant in the lobby.  He said that he dozed off&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and that he and defendant later left the bus terminal together at about 4:30 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned verdicts of guilty as to each of the four charges.  Defendant appealed from judgments imposing prison sentences of life imprisonment on the verdict of guilty of kidnapping, life imprisonment on the verdict of guilty of armed robbery, fifteen years on the verdict of assault with intent to commit rape and ten years on the verdict of crime against nature.  On 16 February 1977, we allowed defendant's motion to bypass the Court of Appeals on the charge of assault with intent to commit rape and on the charge of crime against nature.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgments of the Wake Superior Court (North Carolina), which imposed prison sentences of life imprisonment on the verdict of guilty of kidnapping, life imprisonment on the verdict of guilty of armed robbery, 15 years on the verdict of assault with intent to commit rape, and 10 years on the verdict of crime against nature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had followed a female bus patron into the bathroom where he then forced her to perform oral sex on defendant. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial judge erred in his charge on assault with intent to commit rape by failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses of assault with a deadly weapon, assault upon a female, and simple assault. The court agreed and held that defendant was entitled to a new trial on the charge of assault with intent to commit rape because the trial court should have submitted to the jury the lesser included offense of assault upon a female as the factual issue that separated the greater offense from the lesser, i.e., intent, was not susceptible to clear cut resolution and there was evidence to support either a conviction of assault with intent to commit rape or a conviction of assault upon a female. The court found no error sufficient to warrant disturbing the verdicts and judgments rendered upon the charges of kidnapping, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and crime against nature. The court also held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-39 was neither unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction for assault with intent to commit rape was overturned, and defendant was granted a new trial on that charge only. Defendant's convictions on all other charges were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 2 September 1977 a juvenile petition was filed against James Shelton Banks, a minor, alleging that he had violated G.S. 14-202 in that he did &quot;unlawfully and wilfully peep secretly into a room occupied by Alvalena Manring, a female person.&quot; Prior to the introduction of evidence Banks' attorney moved to dismiss the petition for the reason that G.S. 14-202 is unconstitutional in that it is &quot;overly broad&quot; and &quot;void for vagueness.&quot; On 21 September 1977 Judge Gentry found the statute unconstitutional &quot;on the grounds listed&quot; and dismissed the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state filed for review of the decision of the trial court, which dismissed a proceeding against defendant for unlawfully and willfully peeping secretly into a room occupied by a female person, after finding the statute unconstitutional because it was overly broad and void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that, interpreting the language of the statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-202 prohibited the wrongful spying into a room upon a female with the intent of violating the female's legitimate expectation of privacy. The court determined that such an interpretation was sufficient to inform a person of ordinary intelligence, with reasonable precision, of those acts the statute intended to prohibit, so that he knew what acts he should avoid in order that he would not bring himself within its provisions. The court held, therefore, that &sect; 14-202 was sufficiently definite to give an individual fair notice of the conduct prohibited, and to guide a judge in its application and a lawyer in defending one charged with its violation, and that this statute violated neither N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, nor the due process clause of the federal constitution by reason of vagueness and uncertainty, nor was the statute unconstitutional for overbreadth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant appeals, pursuant to G.S. 7A-27(a), from a conviction of first degree murder and sentence of life imprisonment, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">James, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 22 August 1977 Term, Wilson County Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's principal witness, Nancy Sessoms, testified to the following: Between December, 1976, and May, 1977, she and the deceased, Charles W. &quot;Tommy&quot; Gregory, had been dating and were planning to be married as soon as they were divorced from their then-current spouses.  On 3 May 1977, she was working as a desk clerk in Wilson at the Cherry Hotel, where the deceased lived.  The witness got off work on this date at 11:00 p.m. and went up to the deceased's room, where she observed the deceased and defendant arguing over $ 20.00 that the deceased allegedly owed defendant.  The two men were drinking from a bottle of liquor in the room.  The deceased, during the argument, told defendant to leave and the two of them went into the hall outside the room, where defendant said that he would be coming back after his $ 20.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness then went downstairs, got her television and returned to the deceased's room, at which time defendant was gone.  Approximately thirty-five minutes later, there was a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  knock at the door and the person outside identified himself as &quot;Andy.&quot; The witness glanced up and saw the deceased admit a man to the room and then resumed watching television.  She heard the man tell the deceased that he needed his $ 20.00 to get a room for the night because his wife had thrown him out.  The deceased responded that he didn't have the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness next heard a gunshot, whereupon she looked up and saw defendant standing over the deceased, who was lying on the floor.  The witness grabbed a stick and began to beat defendant on the back with it until he pointed a pistol at her.  She then dropped the stick and backed away and, when she looked again, saw defendant standing against the door to the room.  The deceased at that time was in a semi-kneeling position with his arms around defendant's waist.  At this point, there was a second shot and the witness moved over to the deceased and knelt beside him, placing her hands around his back.  Defendant then went into the hall, pointed the gun at the deceased, who had not moved, and shot him in the back.  A subsequent autopsy revealed an alcohol content in the deceased's blood of .31 milligrams percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, Joseph&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Andy&quot; Barbour, Jr., testified substantially as follows: He and the deceased met around noon on the day of the killing at Willie's Grill.  While there, they discussed the sale of a pistol by defendant to the deceased.  Defendant subsequently went home, where he ate, took a drink of liquor and slept.  Carrying the pistol he and the deceased had discussed, defendant returned to Willie's Grill at about 4:30 p.m., where he again met the deceased.  The two of them remained at the Grill until approximately 6:45 p.m., during which time they drank five or six beers each.  They then went to the deceased's room at the Cherry Hotel, where they drank two more beers each and some liquor that defendant had sent the deceased out to purchase.  Upon his arrival at the room, defendant had removed the pistol from his pocket and placed it on the floor near the head of the bed.  At about 11:00 p.m., defendant went home.  He returned to the room later to get $ 20.00 he had won from the deceased in a gambling game they were playing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he reached the room, defendant was admitted by the deceased, stepped inside and closed the door behind him.  He then asked the deceased if he was going to pay him his money. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The deceased produced a pistol and told defendant that he was going to kill him.  Defendant at this point grabbed the deceased's arm and hand in which he held the pistol and started wrestling with him, during which time Nancy Sessoms began beating defendant in the back with a stick.  In the midst of this altercation, the pistol fired.  The deceased slipped down and grabbed defendant around the waist.  Defendant then backed toward the door, dragging the deceased with him, all the while being beaten by Nancy Sessoms.  When he reached the door, Sessoms struck at his face with the stick and defendant threw up his arm as a shield, at which point the gun in his hand, which he had wrestled away from the deceased, fired again.  The deceased then relaxed his hold and defendant opened the door and left.  Defendant recalled hearing only two shots fired during this encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical testimony revealed that the deceased had been shot three times.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and sought review of the judgment. The court held that: (1) the trial court did not err in limiting defendant's peremptory strikes because additional strikes permitted under N.C. Gen.

The court noted that although no objection was made to the instruction at trial, the statement of a material fact not in evidence constituted reversible error regardless of whether it was preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by respondent from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Griffin, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 8 August 1977 Civil Session of Mecklenburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal by the respondent from the order of the Board of Medical Examiners of the State of North Carolina, hereinafter called the Board, revoking the respondent's license to practice medicine in North Carolina, the Superior Court reviewed the transcript of the evidence and of the proceedings before the Board.  The court concluded that the Board's findings of fact are supported by susbstantial, material and competent evidence set forth in the record and that its conclusions of law are supported by the said findings of fact and are in accordance with law.  The court overruled the respondent's motion to remand the matter to the Board for purposes of discovery and taking additional evidence and affirmed the Board's order revoking the respondent's license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record discloses that Dr. Wilkins was duly licensed to practice medicine in North Carolina and has engaged in such practice in Charlotte since 1946.  In 1974, he was convicted in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County upon the charge that he wilfully and feloniously prepared and subscribed to a false and fraudulent proof of loss, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  including a false and fraudulent medical bill and a false and fraudulent attending physician's report, with the intent that such documents be presented to an insurance company with reference to an automobile accident.  He was sentenced to imprisonment for two years, suspended upon condition that he pay a fine of $ 2,000 and the costs of the action, and remain of general good behavior and not violate any criminal laws of the State of North Carolina or the United States of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In consequence of this conviction, following a hearing by the Board, upon due notice, the Board, on 23 October 1974, entered its order revoking the respondent's license to practice medicine in North Carolina, but suspended this order upon the condition that for a period of five years the respondent &quot;shall not violate a State or Federal law and that for such period he remain of good behavior and conduct his practice of medicine in accordance with proper professional and ethical standards, that he keep adequate records of every patient treated or attended by him regardless of the nature of the patient's illness or condition, and that he appear before this Board at its meeting to be held in December, 1975, or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at such other times as may be requested by the Board, and that he furnish to the Board such records or other information concerning his practice of medicine that the Board may require from time to time, and furnish evidence satisfactory to the Board of his compliance with the foregoing conditions of suspension of the order as may be requested by the Board.&quot; The record does not indicate any appeal from that order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 31 August 1976, the respondent was duly notified by the Board that the Board had preferred against him the following charges:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;1. On November 5, 1974, you issued a written prescription to John Prillaman for Didrex, 50 mg., quantity 30, not for any legitimate medical purpose and not in the course of the legitimate practice of medicine and in violation of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;2. On November 12, 1974, you issued a written prescription to James Madden for Dexozyn [corrected to Desoxyn], 15 mg., quantity 30, not for any legitimate medical purpose and not in the course of the legitimate practice of medicine and in violation of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;3. On December 10, 1974, you issued a written prescription to John Prillaman for Didrex, 50 mg., quantity 100, and Butasol capsules, 50 mg., quantity 30, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  not for any legitimate medical purpose and not in the course of the legitimate practice of medicine and in violation of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;4. On December 10, 1974, you issued a written prescription to James Madden for Dexozyn [corrected by consent to Desoxyn], 15 mg., quantity 30, not for any legitimate medical purpose and not in the course of the legitimate practice of medicine and in violation of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;5. On January 3, 1975, you issued a written prescription to George Arnold for Didrex, 50 mg., quantity 30, not for any legitimate medical purpose and not in the course of the legitimate practice of medicine and in violation of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;6. On February 20, 1975, you issued a written prescription to John Prillaman for Didrex, 50 mg., quantity 100, and Butacaps, 50 mg., quantity 30, not for any legitimate medical purpose and not in the course of the legitimate practice of medicine and in violation of law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 26 October 1976, the Board duly notified the respondent that it would hold a hearing upon the above charges &quot;for the purpose of the Board determining whether or not you have failed to comply with the terms and conditions upon which the order revoking your license to practice medicine in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the State of North Carolina was suspended by this Board on the 23rd of October, 1974, and particularly whether or not you performed and engaged in the following conduct [the above six charges].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the said hearing, at which the respondent appeared and testified and was represented by counsel, the Board, on 10 January, 1977, entered its order revoking the respondent's license to practice medicine in North Carolina.  The order contained the separate finding of the Board as to each of the above six charges, the Board finding as to each such charge that the respondent had, on the dates specified, issued a prescription to the person specified for the drugs specified &quot;without determining whether or not such drugs were necessary for the treatment of any ailment or disease and not for any legitimate medical purpose and not in the course of the legitimate practice of medicine.&quot; Upon these findings of fact, the Board concluded that the said conduct of the respondent &quot;constituted a violation of the laws of North Carolina and constituted dishonorable and unprofessional conduct affecting the practice of medicine, and constituted a violation of and failure to comply with the terms and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conditions upon which revocation of the license to practice medicine heretofore issued by this Board to Dr. Wilkins was suspended by this Board by order entered by the Board dated October 23, 1974.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the respondent's appeal to the Superior Court, that court stayed the order of the Board &quot;pending the outcome of the review of petitioner's appeal in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County,&quot; and, upon the entry of the judgment of the Superior Court, again stayed the order of the Board and the judgment of the court &quot;pending the outcome of the review of petitioner's appeal in the North Carolina Appellate Division.&quot; Thus, notwithstanding the order of the Board revoking his license and the judgment of the Superior Court affirming that order, the respondent has been permitted for 16 months to continue his practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the taking of evidence at the hearing before the Board on the present charges, the respondent moved that there be stricken from each of the above mentioned six charges the phrase &quot;and in violation of law,&quot; for the reason that the respondent had previously been brought to trial on each of these charges in a criminal proceeding at which &quot;the jury deadlocked in its decision&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the charges were subsequently dismissed.&quot; The respondent further moved to dismiss the entire proceeding before the Board on the ground that he was, thereby, placed twice in jeopardy for the same acts which were the basis for the above mentioned criminal proceeding against him.  The Board denied both of these motions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence at the hearing before the Board upon the present charges was, in substance, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TESTIMONY OF JOHN PRILLAMAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is an undercover agent of the State Bureau of Investigation.  In the course of his duty he went to the office of the respondent on 5 November 1974 and, after a short wait in the reception room, was instructed to go in to see the respondent in his inner office.  The respondent was seated at his desk.  The witness entered and sat down beside the desk.  He had never seen the respondent before.  The respondent made no examination of the body of the witness and asked him no question concerning his health or symptoms.  The witness told the respondent he would like to get some Dexedrine, to which the respondent simply said, &quot;No,&quot; without any other comment.  The witness then told the respondent he wanted to get something and the respondent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  replied he would give the witness &quot;either Ionamin or Didrex.&quot; The witness replied that he would rather have Didrex as he had used it before.  The only reason the witness gave the respondent for desiring a prescription for Didrex was that he was a truck driver and stayed on the road &quot;all the time&quot; and needed something to keep him awake.  The respondent then wrote the prescription for Didrex, quantity 30.  The respondent asked the witness' name and the witness gave him a fictitious name and address.  The witness then asked the respondent how much he owed the respondent and was told, &quot;$ 8.00,&quot; which amount he paid the respondent and left the office.  This was the entire consultation on this visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 10 December 1974, this witness again went to the office of the respondent and, after a short wait, was told to go back to the respondent's inner office, which he did.  There he sat beside the respondent at the latter's desk and told him he wanted to get another prescription for Didrex.  The respondent asked his name again.  The witness gave him the same fictitious name and address.  The respondent then wrote the prescription for Didrex and handed it to the witness.  The witness then told&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the respondent that he drove a truck, that he was taking Didrex which worked &quot;real good&quot; to keep him awake but he couldn't get to sleep, so he needed something so that he could go to sleep when he wanted to and asked the respondent to give him something for that purpose.  The respondent then took the same prescription back from the witness and wrote &quot;Butacaps,&quot; quantity 30, thereon, and returned the prescription to the witness.  The witness then paid the respondent $ 10.00 and left the office.  This was the entire consultation on this visit to the respondent's office.  No one then made any examination of the body of the witness or asked him any other questions concerning his reason for wanting these medications.  No nurse or any other member of the respondent's staff took the witness' temperature or blood pressure or made any other type of preparation.  On each visit of this witness to the respondent's office, the respondent asked the name and address of the witness and referred to &quot;a calendar-type thing, a big calendar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 20 February 1975, this witness again went to the office of the respondent, entered the reception room and gave his name and stated he wanted to see the respondent. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After a short wait, he was told to go back into the respondent's inner office, which he did.  He sat down and told the respondent he wanted another prescription for Didrex.  Again, the respondent asked his name and was given by the witness the same fictitious name and address.  The respondent immediately wrote a prescription for Didrex, quantity 100, and handed it to the witness.  The witness then told the respondent he would like another prescription for the Butacaps.  The respondent then wrote another prescription for Butacaps, quantity 30.  The respondent asked the witness on this occasion &quot;how they were doing,&quot; the witness responded that the Didrex were doing &quot;real well,&quot; that he could stay awake as long as he wanted to with them and drive the truck and when he wanted to go to sleep he could take the Butacaps and get to sleep.  Upon receiving the two prescriptions, the witness asked the respondent how much he owed him for the visit and the prescriptions and was told $ 12.00, which the witness paid the respondent and left the office.  This was the entire consultation on that visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Each prescription given to this witness was introduced into evidence.  Each bore directions as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to how the drug was to be taken and each specified &quot;No refill.&quot; The witness had the prescriptions filled and turned the substances received by him from the drug store over to Agent Holbrook of the State Bureau of Investigation.  The witness did not take any of the drugs so obtained by him.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness never indicated to the respondent that the witness wanted these drugs for any use other than his own personal use.  At the time of his visits to the office of the respondent, the witness weighed approximately 190 pounds.  He never mentioned to the respondent that he wanted the pills in order to lose weight.  He was never weighed while in the respondent's office.  At the time of the hearing, the witness weighed approximately 178 pounds and was five feet ten inches in height.  At the time of his visits to the respondent's office, he was not under the influence of any drugs and there was nothing about his appearance to indicate he was a user of drugs.  On the second visit, he did not ask for a larger quantity of Didrex than the amount specified in the first prescription.  The respondent simply wrote the prescription for a larger number of pills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TESTIMONY OF JAMES W. MADDEN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This witness&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is a special agent of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration.  On 12 November 1974, acting in cooperation with the State agency, he went to the office of the respondent and asked the receptionist if he could see the respondent.  She asked his name and he gave his correct name.  After a short wait in the reception room, he was instructed to go in to see the doctor and went into the respondent's inner office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent was standing just inside the doorway and the witness asked, &quot;Doc, can I get some Desoxyn?&quot; The respondent said, &quot;I guess so.&quot; The respondent sat at his desk and the witness took a chair beside the desk.  The respondent started writing a prescription.  He asked the witness his name and address, which he put at the top of the prescription.  He then handed the witness the prescription.  The witness asked how much he owed the respondent and was told, &quot;$ 10.00.&quot; The witness paid the respondent $ 10.00 and left the office.  This was the entire consultation on the occasion of that visit by this witness to the office of the respondent.  While in the respondent's presence, he did not remove his jacket or any of his clothing and he was in the presence of the respondent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  less than two minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the first visit of this witness to the office of the respondent.  On this occasion he received no physical examination from the respondent or any member of his staff.  No medical history was taken.  The witness gave no reason why he needed the medication and no inquiry was made by the respondent as to any such reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 10 December 1974, this witness returned to the office of the respondent and, after a short wait in the reception room, went in to see the doctor.  When he went into the inner office, he asked the respondent if he could get some more Desoxyn.  The respondent asked how long it had been since he had been there before.  The witness said, &quot;About a month ago.&quot; The respondent glanced at the book that he had upon his desk and said, &quot;All right.&quot; He then started writing the prescription for 30 Desoxyn.  He again asked the name and address of the witness and entered this on top of the prescription.  The witness asked him how much he owed him and the respondent said, &quot;$ 10.00,&quot; which amount the witness paid the respondent and thereupon left the office with the prescription.  This was the entire consultation on the occasion of the witness' second&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  visit to the respondent's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness did not observe the respondent make any entry in any record.  He did not observe any card with his name on it or any folder or anything which looked as if it might contain information concerning the witness.  Neither the respondent nor any member of his staff made any examination of the witness or took any information concerning his medical history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The above mentioned prescriptions given to the witness Madden were introduced in evidence.  Each specified, &quot;No refill,&quot; and bore directions as to how the pills were to be used.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness had these prescriptions filled and delivered the substance received to Agent Holbrook of the State Bureau of Investigation.  When he went into the office of the respondent, the witness was not under the influence of any intoxicant or narcotic.  He had not used any of the drugs himself and his appearance did not indicate use of drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TESTIMONY OF GEORGE ARNOLD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This witness is an agent of the State Bureau of Investigation.  At the time of his visit to the office of the respondent, he was engaged in investigating diversion of pharmaceutical drugs which were &quot;diverted to illegitimate channels and eventually&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ended up in street use.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 3 January 1975, the witness visited the office of the respondent and gave a fictitious name to the receptionist, telling her that he wished to see the doctor.  After a short wait in the reception room, he went back to the interior office of the respondent who was sitting at his desk.  The witness told the respondent that, when the witness formerly worked in Fayetteville, there was a doctor who prescribed Preludin to keep the witness awake while he worked and asked if the respondent could help him.  The respondent said, &quot;No.&quot; The witness then said, &quot;How about Didrex?&quot; The respondent asked the name of the witness and was given a fictitious name and address.  The respondent then wrote a prescription for 30 Didrex, 50 mgs., with directions to take one at 10:00 a.m. The witness then stood up, paid the respondent $ 10.00 and left the office.  This was the entire consultation on this visit to the office of the respondent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The prescription so given to this witness was introduced in evidence, it being for Didrex with directions as to its use and specifying, &quot;No refill.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent did not ask this witness any question about the state of his health or symptoms&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and made no examination of his body.  The witness did not remove any part of his clothing during the visit to the office of the respondent.  On this visit to that office, the witness was not under the influence of any drug, narcotic or alcohol.  The story as to the obtaining of Preludin from the doctor in Fayetteville was fictitious.  The witness did not tell the respondent that he wanted to convert these drugs to some illegal use but merely told him that he wanted to stay awake while he worked.  The respondent did not encourage the witness to come back and get more pills or to tell his friends to do so.  On this visit to the respondent's office, this witness was not examined and no history was taken and no questions were asked him, except as to his name and address.  The respondent wrote the name &quot;on a calendar&quot; which was &quot;like a log book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TESTIMONY OF C. D. HOLBROOK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This witness is a special agent of the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation.  Possessed with a search warrant, he searched the office of the respondent on 27 March 1975 for records pertaining to the visits to that office of each of the above witnesses.  He found in the office a &quot;Doctor's Daily Record Book&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  containing a page for each date of the year; the name of each individual patient was entered on a line of such page, together with the medication and the charge.  There was nothing else entered on the page.  The book contained pages showing the visits of Prillaman, Madden and Arnold.  In each instance, the fee recorded in the book was $ 2.00 less than the fee which the above witnesses actually testified they paid the respondent.  The respondent advised this witness that he had no other records concerning these visits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book did not contain any entries of diagnoses of any patients and, in only two or three instances per page, was there an entry showing a patient's blood pressure.  This witness did not find in the record book any &quot;preponderance&quot; of entries of prescriptions.  He did not find in the office what he would consider an abundance of drugs on hand.  His search was limited to a search for records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TESTIMONY OF THE RESPONDENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent recalls the visit of the witness Prillaman to his office on 5 November 1974.  He is quite certain he listened to him and made notes and that Prillaman did not ask for anything to keep him awake.  He recalls prescribing for him Didrex&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as a weight control medicine.  On the second visit Prillaman mentioned that the prescription was not controlling his appetite so he increased the dosage.  He did not weigh Prillaman on any occasion.  He seldom weighs his patients.  He did take Prillaman's blood pressure and found it normal.  Since it was normal, he did not enter it on the book referred to in the testimony of the witness Holbrook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the visit of the witness Prillaman to the office on 20 February 1975, the respondent wrote a prescription for Butacaps because Prillaman said he was unable to sleep and the respondent considered Butacaps a mild sedative, one not used &quot;on the street&quot; as a &quot;downer.&quot; The respondent uses Butacaps frequently for elderly patients and others who need a mild sedative and, in his opinion, it is an appropriate drug for that purpose.  He does not use Didrex for any purpose other than weight control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent recalls that the witness Madden asked for appetite control pills and the respondent prescribed Desoxyn.  The purpose of the prescription was to control his appetite.  He checked Madden's blood pressure but did not weigh him or measure his height.  On Madden's second visit, he requested&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the respondent to give him a prescription for Desoxyn.  The respondent checked his book to make sure it was appropriate with reference to the amount of time between the two prescriptions.  Finding out the time was approximately correct, he gave Madden another prescription for Desoxyn.  He does not recall whether he took Madden's blood pressure on this second visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the occasion of Arnold's visit to his office, the respondent refused to write a prescription for Preludin.  Arnold said he wanted something to control his appetite, to keep his weight down, so the respondent gave him Didrex after checking his blood pressure.  Since the blood pressure was normal, he did not make an entry of it in the book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whenever a patient comes into his office, he has an opportunity to see the patient as he comes through the door and observes his appearance.  Based upon his observation and experience in 30 years of practice, he did not note any condition in these three witnesses which would indicate the likelihood of any reaction to the type of medication prescribed.  Each appeared to be healthy and normal looking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In writing prescriptions for Prillaman, Madden and Arnold, the respondent exercised&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his best medical judgment as to whether or not the prescriptions written by him were appropriate for the uses for which he wrote them on those occasions.  He had no notion that there was any attempt on the part of any of them to obtain drugs for any unlawful purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not think that Didrex was a stimulant or &quot;upper.&quot; He was a little taken aback when the witness Holbrook informed him that it was classified as such.  At the time the prescriptions were written, he did not know this.  He used it solely as an appetite control pill.  He now knows it is an amphetamine.  He is aware that the use of amphetamines as an appetite control substance is disapproved by the Medical Profession generally, but he has never had any adverse complications from such use during his practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prillaman did not mention to the respondent that he needed to stay awake and, had he done so, the respondent would not have given him a prescription.  He knew that Dexedrine, for which Prillaman first asked, was used as an &quot;upper&quot; and that is the reason he refused to give a prescription for it.  He would not have prescribed Didrex to keep the patient awake.  In his opinion, it is not proper medical practice for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a doctor to prescribe a stimulant to enable the patient to stay awake.  Such a request from the patient would be a request for &quot;uppers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was, at the time of the visits of these agents, prescribing Desoxyn for some of his patients for appetite control.  He knows that Desoxyn has amphetamine in it.  He would not consider prescribing Desoxyn just to keep a person awake as proper medical practice.  He knew, at the time of the visits of these agents, that Desoxyn was a Class II controlled substance under the laws of the United States and the laws of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not prescribe these drugs for the reasons given by the above witnesses.  To prescribe these drugs for the purposes testified to by Prillaman, Madden and Arnold would not, in his opinion, constitute proper medical practice, and for him to prescribe such drugs, under the circumstances and for the purposes testified to by these witnesses, would be a violation of the Controlled Substances Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prillaman appeared to him to be overweight, though he did not weigh him.  Madden also appeared to be overweight.  The respondent would not say that Arnold was overweight but he appeared, at the time of his visit, to be &quot;a little&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  heavier&quot; than at the time of the hearing.  He has many patients who come in and say they want to lose a few pounds, so he gives them appetite control pills for about 30 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his opinion, he has kept the records required by the previous order of the Board.  He did not understand this to require a medical history of the patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Prillaman, Madden nor Arnold requested the respondent to give him something to keep him awake.  None of these asked specifically for an appetite suppressant.  One of them came in and asked for something to control his weight.  He does not know whether the other two specifically mentioned appetite or weight control but he does know none of these witnesses asked for something to keep him awake.  Each either asked for an appetite depressant or expressed a desire to lose weight or the respondent assumed that was what he wanted.  Prillaman, Madden and Arnold did not testify truthfully.  In his opinion, they did not forget what had occurred on their visits to his office and, therefore, &quot;They lied to get their point over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is quite certain that Agent Holbrook has had other people come into his office asking for other drugs.  He knows people have been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to his office through the years asking for certain things for which he would not write prescriptions for them.  Had Prillaman, Madden and Arnold asked for something to keep them awake, they would not have gotten anything from him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Board so desires, he has no objection to keeping a complete medical history on all of his patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REBUTTAL TESTIMONY OF GEORGE ARNOLD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is 27 years of age.  His height is five feet ten inches and his weight approximately 139 polunds.  At the time of his visit to the respondent's office, he weighed about 143 pounds.  He has never had any problem about weight control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REBUTTAL TESTIMONY OF C. D. HOLBROOK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been connected with this type of investigation since it was started in October, 1974.  The only agents known to him to have made any undercover visits to the office of the respondent were Agents Prillaman, Madden and Arnold on the occasions to which they testified at this hearing.  He is not aware of any such visits by any other people associated with other law enforcement agencies.  He would not know about that.  He would have no way of knowing if people not connected with the Law Enforcement Agency had visited the office of the respondent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  making requests for drugs.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent doctor challenged the decision of the Superior Court, Civil Session of Mecklenburg (North Carolina), which reviewed the order of the Board of Medical Examiners of the State of North Carolina revoking the doctor's license to practice medicine, and concluded that the board's findings of fact and conclusions of law were supported by substantial, material, and competent evidence, thereby affirming the revocation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The doctor was convicted of a felony. The board revoked the doctor's license but suspended the order of revocation, giving him a second chance. One of the conditions of the suspension was that for five years he was to remain in good behavior and conduct his practice of medicine in accordance with proper professional and ethical standards. Less than two weeks after that order was issued the doctor wrote a prescription for Didrex, commonly known as speed, at the request of a complete stranger, with no physical examination of him, no taking of his medical history, and no questions as to any symptoms. The stranger was a truck driver and needed something to keep him awake. The doctor's license was then revoked. The doctor contended that the statute under which the board acted, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-14, and the conditions of suspension were both vague and overbroad; thus the revocation order violated his right to due process of law as established by the N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, and by the Fourteenth Amendment. The court disagreed, finding adequate procedural due process and finding that prescribing a drug for a complete stranger was prohibited in the original order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court's decision against the doctor in the board's order to revoke his license to practice medicine. The license revocation was authorized by both the statute and the conditions of the board's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c1"><SPAN CLASS="c4">April 17, 1978, Filed </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This matter came before us on petition for discretionary review of the decision of the Court of Appeals, 32 N.C. App. 787, 236 S.E. 2d 734 (1977), (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Brock, C.J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, concurred in by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Parker</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Arnold, JJ.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, reported under Rule 30(e)), affirming orders of the North Carolina Utilities Commission.  This case was docketed and argued during Fall Term 1977 as No. 44.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 17 January 1975, Piedmont Natural Gas Company filed an application with the Utilities Commission seeking authority to increase its rates by a surcharge on all rate schedules, the proceeds of which were to be used to fund an exploration program to discover new sources of natural gas independent of Piedmont's principal pipeline supplier, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco).  In response to this application, the Utilities Commission, by order of 17 February 1975, established Docket No. G-100, Sub 22, for the purpose of conducting a rule making investigation into the feasibility of increasing the supplies of natural gas to North Carolina.  This order also provided that all five North Carolina intrastate natural gas distributing utility companies, as well as the Attorney General, were to be parties to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  these proceedings.  Similar applications for exploration and drilling surcharges were filed by the other four natural gas distributing companies in March, 1975 and notice of the proposed surcharge was given to each of the customers of the five utilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hearings were conducted May 13-15, 1975, at which extensive testimony and exhibits were received in evidence concerning the proposed exploration surcharge, the probability of securing additional natural gas supplies for North Carolina consumers, alternative avenues for securing natural gas supplies, alternative methods of financing the proposed exploration programs, and the consequences to industrial, commercial and residential gas consumers of North Carolina if additional gas supplies were not obtained.  On 26 June 1975, the Commission issued an order in which it adopted Commission Rule R1-17(h).  This order granted no specific increase in rates; rather, it established by rule certain procedures for participation by the utilities in exploration and drilling programs and for making applications for rate adjustments to recover costs and account for revenues associated with such programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During August of 1975, the Commission issued&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  orders approving three exploration and drilling ventures.  On 11 December 1975, the Commission provided in a further order that only 75% of the financing of participation in exploration projects was to come from customer funds, with the remaining 25% to be obtained from stockholder monies.  No appeal appears to have been taken from any of these orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November and December of 1975, three of the five North Carolina natural gas utilities filed for rate increases, pursuant to Rule R1-17(h), to recover excess costs of the approved exploration ventures.  The Commission approved these tracking rate increases in January, 1976, whereupon the Attorney General gave timely notice of appeal and filed exceptions to the approval orders.  Upon motion of the applicants, a hearing on the Attorney General's exceptions was held before the Commission on 16 March 1976.  On 8 April 1976, the Commission issued supplemental orders approving the tracking increases and affirming its earlier rate increase orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three rate dockets were consolidated for purposes of appeal and, as noted earlier, the orders of the Utilities Commission were affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals affirmed orders of the utilities commission, which approved tracking rate increases for the gas utilities.

The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals. The court held that: (1) the utilities commission, in ordering that the reasonable costs of approved exploration projects were to be recoverable through tracking rate increases, acted within its acknowledged duty and authority to compel adequate and efficient utility service to the citizens of the state; (2) the attorney general was in no way prejudiced by the action of the commission in approving the rate increases without a hearing; (3) any discrimination between present and future ratepayers appeared to be averted because any rewards accruing from the rate increases had to be preserved for the customers supplying the funds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant appeals from judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Webb, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 25 July 1977 Session, New Hanover Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon a bill of indictment, proper in form, charging him with the first degree murder of Donnie Dent on 11 July 1973 in the City of Wilmington, New Hanover County, North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence is narrated in the following numbered paragraphs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On 11 July 1973 around 4 p.m. Sergeant T. E. McLaurin of the Wilmington Police Department saw defendant, whom he had known for six or seven years, near 8th and Dawson Streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. James Butler and Donnie Dent were both selling drugs for defendant Lamont Tindall, and both owed defendant money.  On 11 July 1973 Butler and Dent were standing in front of a home on 8th Street in Wilmington when defendant walked across the street with a gun in his hand, fired one shot which felled Dent and, when Butler ran, began chasing him.  At the time of trial in this case Butler was in prison on charges of possession and sale of heroin but was brought into court and testified as a witness for the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. On 11 July 1973 Cleveland Brown spoke to James Butler and Donnie Dent in the vicinity of 8th and Dawson Streets, passed defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  while walking toward the Dew Drop Inn and immediately thereafter heard a shot.  Brown turned and saw Donnie Dent lying on the ground, but neither Butler nor defendant was anywhere in sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. On the Saturday immediately prior to 11 July 1973 defendant told Annette Green that &quot;there was some niggers he was going to kill&quot; and that Donnie Dent and James Butler were among them because they owed him money.  Defendant then showed Annette Green a list of names which included the names of Dent and Butler.  Annette Green thereupon warned both Butler and Donnie Dent's brother of defendant's intentions.  On 11 July 1973 she was sitting on a porch on 8th Street plaiting some people's hair when defendant approached and said, &quot;Give me a gun, give me a gun -- anybody got a gun.&quot; A man named Norman Green opened his car trunk and gave defendant a gun.  Defendant took a few steps into 8th Street, fired the pistol at Donnie Dent and James Butler, hitting Dent, and then chased Butler down an alley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Diane Brunson was with Annette Green on the Saturday prior to 11 July 1973 when defendant, whom she was dating at the time, stated that he was going to kill Donnie Dent and James Butler because they owed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  him money and further stated that if he did not kill them his contact in New York would do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Francis Dent Boyd saw defendant in Wilmington on 11 July 1973 when he came to her mother's house asking for her brother Donnie Dent who was not home at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The State and defendant stipulated that Donnie Dent died on 11 July 1973 as the result of a single gunshot wound in the right chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified as a witness in his own behalf.  His testimony tends to show that he was born and reared in Wilmington, North Carolina, but had moved to New York and was living there in the summer of 1973.  He was self-employed selling clothes and did not return to North Carolina at any time during that summer and did not kill Donnie Dent.  In 1974 he moved to Philadelphia where he worked as a shipping clerk for two years.  In September 1975 he was convicted of distributing cocaine and heroin and was serving a sentence at the federal prison in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, at the time of this trial.  Defendant further testified that he saw Sergeant W. C. Brown of the Wilmington Police Department in 1975 while he was in federal custody, at which time Sergeant Brown identified him as Lamont Tindall&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  although he had been using the name Lamont Boney since 1971.  He denied seeing Vivian Davis, Catherine Beatty, Patricia Graham or Joseph Dent on 11 July 1973 in Wilmington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norman Green, a defense witness, testified he did not see defendant on 11 July 1973, did not own a car on that date, and did not give defendant a pistol.  He did hear a gunshot on 11 July 1973 and saw a man about six feet tall leaving the scene.  This witness was serving time for manslaughter at the time of this trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sidney Morgan of the Wilmington Police Department, a defense witness, testified he was on duty on 11 July 1973 and took a statement from Norman Green in which Green stated that he saw a black male about six feet tall shoot Donnie Dent and run south on 8th Street, after which Green and a friend took Dent to the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant then called Moses Isler, Billy Smith and George Formey, all residents of New York City, but they were not in court.  The following statement of Moses Isler, sworn to before a notary public on 8 July 1977, was read to the jury:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;My name is Moses Isler.  I'm 58 years old.  I work as a manager of the Hot Shot Bar.  I have been working there going on thirty-one years. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  I have lived in New York for the past thirty years.  I was born in Wilson, North Carolina.  I know Lamont Tindall.  In the summer of 1973 I was in New York and I knew Lamont Tindall then.  In the summer of 1973 he stayed at my house during that time.  That is the same address as I now have.  I did not know of him going down to North Carolina at any time during the summer of 1973, because I used to see him every night.  My son's birthday is on the 4th of July and on the 4th of July of 1973 I know Lamont Tindall was here in New York because he was in a room in my house and I know he didn't go down South nowhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In rebuttal, the State offered Vivian Davis, Catherine Beatty, Patricia Graham and Amos Bruce, all of whom testified that they saw Lamont Tindall in Wilmington on 11 July 1973.  Amos Bruce further testified that he saw defendant with a pistol in his hand, heard a shot fired and saw Donnie Dent fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer McLaurin was recalled and testified, among other things, that after Donnie Dent was killed he attempted, without success, to locate Lamont Tindall and serve a murder warrant upon him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury convicted defendant of murder in the first degree, and he was sentenced&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to life imprisonment.  Defendant appealed to the Supreme Court assigning errors noted in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Eyewitnesses reported that they saw defendant shoot the victim then run after the victim's companion. After the murder defendant left North Carolina and lived out-of-state under an assumed name until defendant's apprehension for violation of federal narcotics laws. Defendant made no demand for a final disposition of the murder charge until nearly four years after the murder and made no speedy trial request. After defendant's conviction and imposition of a life sentence, defendant appealed. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that the state did not deprive defendant of his right to a speedy trial. Much of the delay was caused by defendant himself by fleeing the state after the incident and committing violations of federal law, both of which complicated and obstructed the process of bringing defendant to trial. Defendant never demanded a speedy trial, and defendant suffered no significant prejudice as a result of the delay. The trial court's denial of defendant's material witness orders was correct and deprived defendant of no constitutional right. There were limitations on a state trial court's authority to compel the attendance of non-resident witnesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Webb, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 21 August 1977 Criminal Session of New Hanover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under indictments, each proper in form, the defendant was charged with and convicted of first degree burglary and first degree rape.  He was sentenced on each count to life imprisonment, the sentences to run concurrently, the court recommending that the defendant be given psychiatric examination and treatment in the prison system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State, uncontroverted except by the defendant's plea of not guilty, was ample to support the verdict as to each offense, being to the effect that, at 4:30 a.m., on 12 July 1977, a man broke and entered the home of the victim, wherein she and her two small children were sleeping, with the intent to commit larceny and rape and did commit rape upon her with the use of a knife, and was also ample to identify the defendant as the perpetrator of these offenses.  It is not necessary to the understanding of this appeal to recount the details of this evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant did not testify and all of his evidence was designed to establish his defense of insanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant's mother testified to a long series of activities of the defendant, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  since infancy, indicating his violent temper and emotional instability and leading her to the opinion that he did not know right from wrong.  On cross-examination, however, when asked if she was saying he did not know it was wrong to commit rape and to break into a house, she replied, as to each such inquiry, &quot;No, I am not saying that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Robert Weinstein, an expert in the field of psychiatry, and a witness for the defendant, testified that he examined the defendant and this examination led him to the conclusion that the defendant suffers from a mental disease or defect which he denominated, &quot;borderline personality-organization.&quot; This, he said, is a medically recognized disease or defect of the mind which he characterized as &quot;a stable instability.&quot; His examination of the defendant led him to the opinion that the defendant had been a &quot;misfit&quot; all of his life and never able to get along with people and, when his feelings were hurt or he became offended, he would become quite angry and tend to strike back at society in general.  In the opinion of Dr. Weinstein, the defendant &quot;knew while he was raping the person that what he was doing was wrong, but he didn't want to stop.&quot; The doctor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testified he was not sure whether the defendant could or could not stop.  In the opinion of Dr. Weinstein, the defendant &quot;knew the quality of his actions and the nature of them, and he knew right from wrong.&quot; Specifically, the doctor testified that the defendant knew burglary and rape were wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By stipulation, the defendant introduced in evidence a report of his examination and treatment, when he was 16 years of age, at the Portsmouth, Virginia, Psychiatric Center.  This report stated that the defendant's &quot;grip on reality&quot; was shaky and, while he did not appear to be &quot;blatantly psychotic or retarded,&quot; there were definite indications of an incipient psychosis, so that the defendant then needed long-term therapy in a &quot;structured institution.&quot; The report characterized him as &quot;most difficult to manage at times,&quot; so that to confront him or make a demand upon him &quot;would provoke a very stubborn or hostile or physically inappropriate reaction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In rebuttal, the State offered the testimony of Dr. Robert Rollins, a member of the staff of Dorothea Dix Hospital and a specialist in psychiatry.  Dr. Rollins testified, &quot;As a result of my examination, I formed the opinion that James Pagano understood&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the nature and quality of his actions and knew right from wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court instructed the jury first to consider the following issue:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Was James William Pagano at the time of the alleged burglary and rape, by reason of a defect of reason or disease of the mind, incapable of knowing the nature and quality of the acts which he is charged with having committed, or, if he did know this, was he, by reason of such defect or disease, incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong in relation to such act?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury answered this issue, &quot;no,&quot; thus finding the defendant not insane, and then found him guilty of the two offenses charged.  The defendant excepted to the submission of the above issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant also excepted to that portion of the following instruction which is here enclosed in parentheses:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;(I do charge you that a mental disease or defect is not sufficient.  The disease or defect must have so impaired the defendant's mental capacity that he either did not know the nature and quality of his act or did not know it was wrong.) On the other hand, it need not be shown that the defendant lacked mental capacity with regard to all matters.  Now, a person may be sane&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  on every subject but one and yet, if his mental disease or defect with reference to that one subject rendered him unable to know the nature and quality of the act with which he is charged, or to know that the act was wrong, his defense is complete; that is, that his defense of insanity is complete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR></DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;No error.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At defendant's trial, his mother testified that defendant did not know right from wrong, but she also stated that she was not stating that defendant did not know it was wrong to commit rape and to break into a house. A psychiatrist testified that defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect which was termed a stable instability but that defendant knew that burglary and rape were wrong. The State's psychiatrist testified that defendant knew right from wrong. The jury determined that defendant was not insane and convicted him of first degree burglary and first degree rape. The court affirmed. The inaccuracy in the recapitulation of defendant's mother's testimony was not called to the attention of the trial court to allow a correction and was waived. In addition, defendant voluntarily and knowingly waived his right to counsel before making a statement to the investigating officers. Also, the statement defendant made was not per se incriminating. Defendant's statement, so admitted, could only have prejudiced defendant through its inherent implausibility. The trial judge properly placed upon defendant the burden of proof on the question of his insanity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On certiorari to the Court of Appeals to review its decision, reported in 34 N.C. App. 233, 237 S.E. 2d 909, finding no error on the defendant's appeal from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Kivett, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 6 December 1976 Session of Forsyth.  The defendant's appeal, as a matter of right, from the decision of the Court of Appeals was dismissed upon the motion of the Attorney General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to four separate indictments, each proper in form, the defendant was found guilty of the kidnapping of each of two young women and of forcing each of them to commit with him a crime against nature.  The two charges of kidnapping were consolidated for judgment and, in those cases, the defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for 28 to 40 years.  In each of the cases charging the commission of a crime against nature, the defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years, these two sentences to run consecutively with respect to each other but both to run concurrently with the sentence for kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense is alibi.  The defendant, a parolee from the Federal prison system, which circumstance was not made known to the jury, did not testify in his own behalf.  Thus, except by virtue of defendant's plea of not guilty&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with reference to each charge, the State's evidence as to the commission of the alleged offenses is not controverted and the principal issue of fact is as to the identification of the defendant as the perpetrator of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant also contends, as a matter of law, that the sentence upon the charges of kidnapping is improper for that G.S. 14-39, which defines and prescribes the punishment for kidnapping, violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  The Court of Appeals adopted a construction of this statute which, if correct, the defendant, in oral argument, conceded would remove the basis for his contention that the statute is unconstitutional.  The statute had not previously been construed by the Appellate Courts of this State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State, if true, was sufficient to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of 8 September 1976, the two young women, on a vacation trip from their homes in Canada, reached and took lodging in Motel No. 6 in Winston-Salem.  On previous visits to Winston-Salem, they had stayed at this motel.  There were no telephones in the rooms of the motel but telephones available for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  use of its guests were at a well lighted alcove in or near the lobby, a well lighted hallway leading thereto from the room assigned to and occupied by the young women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few minutes after their occupancy of their room, at approximately 7:30 p.m., both of the young women went to the telephone alcove in an unsuccessful effort to place calls to their friends in the city.  While so engaged, both of them observed the defendant, not previously known to them, using, or purporting to use, one of the other telephones in the alcove.  Their attention was called to him by a comment which he made to one of them and by his general demeanor which they regarded as &quot;strange.&quot; They remained in the telephone alcove on this occasion, some four feet from the defendant, for approximately fifteen minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the custom of the motel, upon receipt of an incoming call for a guest, to send a messenger to the room of the guest to notify him or her of such call.  At approximately 10:30 p.m., the defendant knocked at the door of the room occupied by these young women, who looked out through the curtain and observed that he was the man previously seen by them in the telephone alcove.  He advised them that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  there was a telephone call for their room.  Thereupon, one of the women went to the telephone alcove where she found one of the telephones off the hook but &quot;dead.&quot; The defendant was observed by her for &quot;about a minute&quot; in the well lighted alcove.  She thanked him and returned to the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 11:00 p.m., the defendant again knocked at the door of the room and was once more recognized by the women, who looked through the glass window and observed him standing about six inches away and under a light over the door to the room.  Again, he said there was a telephone call so, again, one of the young women went to the telephone alcove and again found the telephone &quot;dead.&quot; The defendant was again standing in the alcove and said, &quot;Someone is trying to play a joke on you.&quot; He then walked with the young woman back along the hallway to the door of her room.  She observed that he was wearing a &quot;big belt&quot; from which a bunch of keys was hanging by a chain.  In response to her inquiry, he said that he did not work at the motel.  Arriving at her door, she again thanked him for his trouble and thereupon &quot;felt something&quot; at her side.  Thinking he &quot;was trying to be fresh,&quot; she uttered an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  exclamation, whereupon he pushed her into the room saying: &quot;Don't make a sound.  I've got a knife.&quot; They then went into the room where the other young woman had remained and the defendant closed the door, again saying: &quot;I've got a knife.  I can kill you.  Don't make a sound.  Just cooperate and everything will be okay.&quot; He did, in fact, have an open knife in his hand, the blade being about four inches in length.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant then compelled the two young women to lie upon one of the beds and, taking from his pocket a roll of tape, some three inches in width and metallic gray in color, he tore off strips of the tape and with these bound the hands of each woman behind her back.  While they were so bound, he compelled each of them, in turn, to commit an act of oral sex upon his person.  In the course of this conduct one of the young women observed that the defendant had a small growth upon the side of his sex organ.  The presence of such growth upon the defendant was observed and testified to by a medical expert who, pursuant to an order of the court, over defendant's objection, examined the defendant during the course of the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During or after the completion of the offense against&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the second of the young women, the first broke free from her bonds and snatched the defendant's knife.  A struggle for the knife followed, during which the other young woman managed to get the door of the room open and flee down the hall to the motel lobby, whereupon the defendant fled from the room and down the hallway in the other direction, escaping from the motel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a matter of minutes, city police officers arrived at the motel and the women described their assailant to them in the presence of the motel manager, who immediately advised the officers that the description seemed to fit a man registered in the motel and produced the motel's registration card for the room occupied by such man, the name shown on the card being &quot;David L. Fulcher.&quot; Over objection, this card was introduced in evidence, the manager having testified that he did not personally observe the filling out of that card by the occupant of the room, purportedly David L. Fulcher, but that it was the regular business practice of the motel to have each guest complete and sign such card, which card the motel then kept in its permanent records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigating officers at once communicated with police headquarters&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and ascertained that the police did have a photograph of one &quot;David L. Fulcher.&quot; This photograph and those of four other men, also taken from the police files, were immediately brought to the investigating officers at the motel and shown by them to the two young women separately.  One of them advised the officers that the photograph of the defendant was a photograph of their assailant.  The other young woman said that her assailant had certain resemblances to two of the subjects shown in the photographs, one of these being the defendant.  Each photograph bore upon the chest of its subject a prison number, which number was covered, by order of the trial judge, before the photograph was placed in evidence before the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereupon, the defendant was arrested at an all-night restaurant approximately a mile from the motel, the arrest being made not over two hours after the offenses were committed.  At the time of his arrest, the defendant was wearing clothing, a belt and bunch of keys fitting the description of the clothing, belt and keys worn by their assailant given by the two young women to the investigating officers immediately after they were attacked.  The defendant's own physical&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  description then also fit that given by the two young women of their assailant.  The photograph, having been made several years before, showed him as substantially younger and thinner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the defendant was arrested, his car was impounded by the police.  It was released to the defendant's brother the following day.  On that day, the defendant's wife, from whom he was separated, went with her brother to the car and, with the consent of the defendant's brother, in whose custody it was, opened the door of the car and removed therefrom her clothing and other belongings.  As she did so, a roll of gray, metallic colored tape fell out of the car onto the ground.  It was picked up by the brother of the defendant's wife and was later delivered by him to the investigating police officers.  This roll of tape, identified by the two young women as the roll possessed and used by their assailant, was introduced in evidence over objection.  Strips of tape used by their assailant in binding and gagging the two young women were also introduced in evidence.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of the kidnapping two young women under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-39 (1975) and of forcing each of them to commit with him a crime against nature. The Court of Appeals (North Carolina), on review of its decision to dismiss defendant's appeal, found no error. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant restrained two women in a motel where they were staying and forced them to perform oral sex. Defendant's contentions on appeal included the argument that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-39 (1975) violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court found that 1) the appellate court erred in its holding that &quot;substantiality&quot; in terms of distance or time was an essential of kidnapping under &sect; 14-39; 2) the statute was not intended by the legislature to make a restraint that was an inherent feature of some other felony also kidnapping; but 3) defendant bound the hands of each of two women, procuring their submission by his threat to use a deadly weapon to inflict serious injury, thus restraining each woman within the meaning of &sect; 14-39 for the purpose of forcing them to commit a crime against nature; and 4) the crime of kidnapping was complete, irrespective of whether the then contemplated crime against nature ever occurred. The court also found that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-57 did not apply in regard to testimony by defendant's brother-in-law because it concerned the spousal privilege. The brother-in-law's testimony was admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurers were not writers of automobile liability insurance. When the Insurance Commissioner entered two orders purporting to revise, respectively, automobile liability and automobile physical damage insurance rates, the insurers challenged those orders. Their position was that they had neither notice nor opportunity to be heard in the proceedings leading to the challenged order. The court noted that the challenged order never became operative and that it had already previously determined to vacate the order. New procedures involving both automobile liability and automobile collision insurance already took place under new statutes codified in N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 58 (Cum. Supp. 1977), and the Insurance Commissioner entered a comprehensive order approving new liability and collision rates. The court determined that under these circumstances the questions raised on the appeal were moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Grist, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 16 August 1976 Special Session of McDowell Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a bill of indictment, proper in form, defendant was tried and convicted of the first-degree murder of Herman Lee Philyaw and was sentenced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State introduced evidence tending to show that in the early morning of 7 May 1975, David Lee Philyaw, the victim's son, and Reuben Clark were riding to work in rural Caldwell County with David's father, in a pickup truck belonging to David's father, Herman Lee Philyaw.  While traveling on a private road near State Highway 90, north of Collettsville, Herman Lee Philyaw stopped the truck so that one of the passengers could clear some brush off the road.  David then heard a loud explosion, whereupon the side glass on the driver's side shattered and his father slumped forward in the driver's seat.  The truck began rolling, and as David Lee Philyaw grabbed the steering wheel he recognized Bobby Burns with a rifle in his hand running along the road.  Burns and another individual were trying to enter a white Ford automobile which was leaving the scene, but were unable to do so.  David steered the truck toward Burns, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  overtook him and pinned him against a bank.  The other individual ran across the road toward the river.  David jumped out of the truck, grabbed a .22 sawed-off rifle from Burns' hands, and started beating Burns with the weapon.  He then ran up to his grandfather's house and had him call the sheriff and an ambulance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Philyaw had known Bobby Burns several years, and Burns had lived in his father's house at one time.  David did not recognize either the driver of the white Ford which left the scene, or the person who tried to get into that vehicle just before it sped away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herman Lee Philyaw died from the gunshot wound shortly afterward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bobby Burns, Isaiah Hood, Edith Philyaw (deceased's wife) and the defendant were all charged with the murder of Herman Lee Philyaw.  Bobby Burns and Isaiah Hood pled guilty to second degree murder and testified for the State at defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bobby Burns testified that he worked at Harper's Furniture Company with Edith Philyaw and Isaiah Hood.  He had previously lived in the Philyaw home for some nine months and was in love with Mrs. Philyaw; and on one occasion Burns and Mrs. Philyaw had spent the weekend together.  Burns also testified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that approximately one month prior to 7 May 1975, Edith Philyaw gave him an envelope containing money which he was to deliver to Isaiah Hood, defendant's nephew, and that on the day prior to the killing, Burns, Isaiah Hood and defendant met and planned the murder of Herman Lee Philyaw.  At this time defendant said that he would shoot Philyaw.  Burns was to accompany him and shoot his .22 rifle into the back of the vehicle to slow it down.  Isaiah was to drive the getaway car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burns further testified that early on the morning of 7 May, the three men travelled to a spot which Philyaw normally passed on his way to work.  They put some brush in the road, and defendant and Burns took up positions on opposite sides of the road.  Defendant had a shotgun and Burns had a .22 rifle.  When the victim's truck approached Burns heard defendant yell, &quot;Get ready, here he comes.&quot; When the truck stopped Burns heard a loud explosion, whereupon he jumped and his rifle went off into the air.  On cross-examination the witness admitted to having made prior inconsistent statements to police, and further admitted that, prior to the killing, he had made the statement that he would kill Herman Philyaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isaiah&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hood testified that Bobby Burns gave him an envelope containing several hundred dollars, and that he then gave this to his uncle, the defendant.  On the morning of 7 May 1975, he drove Burns and defendant to a spot near Collettsville, let them out and then parked his car on the side of the road.  He did not see either defendant or Burns with a gun, nor did he know whether or not someone else was in the woods with Bobby Burns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">S.B.I. employee Frederick Hurst, a firearm and tool marks examiner, testified that fragments and wadding taken from the victim's person and his truck could only have been fired from a 12 gauge shotgun, and could not have been fired from a .22 rifle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howard Mathes testified that on the morning of 7 May 1975 at 7:30 a.m., defendant came by his house just off Highway 90 near Collettsville.  Defendant was on foot, and asked Mathes to take him to his home in Harpertown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered no evidence.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and three others including the victim's wife were charged with the murder. Two co-defendants pled guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for testifying against defendant at trial, leaving defendant and the victim's wife to stand trial in Caldwell County, where the crime occurred. The victim's wife sought a change of venue based on her inability to get a fair trial, which the court granted. The State successfully sought, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-84, to have the venue of defendant's case transferred from Caldwell County to McDowell County. Defendant sought in McDowell County to have his case transferred back to Caldwell County, but his motion was denied. On appeal from his conviction, the court held that his right to be tried in the county where the charged crime allegedly occurred was statutorily based and was not a right grounded in the federal and state constitution. Moreover, as he was not represented by counsel at the time of codefendant's motion for change of venue, the prosecutor had a right to seek a change of venue of defendant's prosecution as he could not obtain a fair trial in the county where the murder occurred.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in separate bills of indictment with armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injuries.  The charges were consolidated for trial.  At arraignment, defendant stood mute, and the court entered a plea of not guilty for defendant in each case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered evidence tending to show that about 9:00 p.m. on 4 October 1975, Grady Lawrence Williams encountered David Adams in downtown Charlotte.  Adams introduced Williams to defendant, Marion Howard Bundridge, and the three of them walked together to a railroad trestle near the intersection of 5th and 6th Streets.  At that place, defendant seized Williams, placed a sharp instrument to his throat, and commanded that Williams give him his money.  After Williams gave Adams his wallet and money, defendant cut Williams' throat, stabbed him in the back, and cut him around the head, shoulders, and chest.  Williams testified that the place where he met defendant was in front of the Jiffy House on West Trade Street which was a well-lighted area.  He further&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stated that he never lost consciousness during the time he was being assaulted by defendant.  An unidentified lady called the police, and he was taken to the hospital where a severed windpipe and other wounds were sutured.  His left arm was partially paralyzed as a result of the assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, on the night of 4 October 1975, police officers went to defendant's residence and after identifying themselves entered the residence at defendant's invitation.  They observed blood-stained trousers, a blood-stained coat, and shoes which appeared to be spotted with fresh blood.  These items of clothing were taken by officers with defendant's consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant did not testify but offered expert testimony which indicated that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia.  He also offered testimony of lay witnesses who testified to certain irrational acts including statements by defendant that the government subjected him to laser beams in an attempt to control his mind.  The lay witnesses also testified that, in their opinion, defendant was suffering from some sort of mental disorder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned verdicts of guilty of armed robbery and guilty of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  kill inflicting serious injuries.  Defendant appealed from judgment sentencing him to life imprisonment for armed robbery and twenty years on the charge of assault.  The judgment in the assault case provided that the sentence imposed therein would run concurrently with the sentence in the robbery case.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Mecklenburg Superior Court (North Carolina) of armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injuries. On appeal, he argued that a pre-trial order finding him mentally incapacitated was admissible, the jury charge was prejudicial, and the victim's in-court identification, testimony concerning photographic identification procedures, and his clothing should have been excluded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim testified that his identification at trial was based upon seeing the men who attacked him during the assault. On appeal, the court held that the order that declared defendant mentally incapacitated was admissible on the question of his insanity. However, exclusion of the order was not prejudicial error, given the testimony of defendant's expert and lay witnesses. Although the trial judge apparently committed obvious error in the jury charge, given that the jury had written issues for decision the charge did not mislead the jury. That the judge fully explained the commitment procedures for one found not guilty by reason of mental illness, as opposed to the defendant's request that the jury merely be instructed that such procedures existed, was favorable to defendant and to limit the instruction would cause jury confusion. The photographic procedure was not so impermissibly suggestive as to violate defendant's constitutional right to due process. Even if it were, the in-court identification was properly admitted into evidence. The connection of defendant's blood-spattered clothing to the crime was a reasonable one, and its admission was not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found no error to justify disturbing the verdicts or the judgments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This proceeding is before the Supreme Court upon the recommendation of the Judicial Standards Commission (Commission), filed with this Court on 30 December 1976, that Herbert W. Hardy, a judge of the General Court of Justice, District Court Division, Eighth Judicial District (Respondent), be censured for wilful misconduct in office and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute.  See Article IV, section 17(2) of the North Carolina Constitution and G.S. 7A-376 (1975 Cum. Supp.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proceeding was instituted before the Commission by the filing of a verified complaint on 3 November 1976 which alleged that Respondent had engaged in wilful misconduct in office and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute.  The various acts of misconduct alleged in the complaint are hereinafter set out in the Commission's Findings of Fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent filed a verified answer averring: (1) that the statute under which the Commission attempts to proceed is unconstitutional; (2) that Respondent was not properly notified of the investigation of him, the nature of the charge and whether the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  investigation was on the Commission's own motion or upon written complaint, and that Respondent was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to present relevant matters, in violation of Rule 7(b) of the Rules of the Judicial Standards Commission; (3) that the complaint itself is not properly verified; (4) that Respondent did release Roland Coley from jail for time served due to the sheriff's complaint of over-crowded jail conditions but such conduct was not prejudicial to the administration of justice; (5) that Respondent did write a letter to Judge F. Fetzer Mills on behalf of C. B. Henson but such act was not wilful misconduct and was not prejudicial to the administration of justice; and (6) that Respondent has no independent recollection of all other events alleged in the complaint to constitute wilful misconduct and such allegations are denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon due notice Respondent was accorded a full adversary hearing before the Commission on 18 February 1977 at which time he was present and represented by counsel.  Millard R. Rich, Jr., Deputy Attorney General and special counsel, presented the evidence in support of the charges.  Respondent, represented by his attorneys of record, did not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testify in his own behalf but offered many witnesses who testified to his good character.  After hearing all evidence the Commission made written findings of fact from which it concluded as a matter of law that the conduct of Respondent, detailed in the findings, constituted wilful misconduct in office and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute.  The specific findings upon which the Commission based these conclusions are as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;7. That on November 15, 1974, Jim Rastus Grimsley, Route 1, Box 395, Ayden, N. C., in case no. 74CR14498, Wayne County, was charged in a warrant issued on said date by Magistrate W. H. Greenfield with unlawfully and wilfully operating a motor vehicle on a public street or highway at a speed of 75 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour zone.  On January 7, 1975, defendant Grimsley pled guilty to speeding 70 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour zone in District Court of Wayne County, presided over by the Respondent.  That on April 16, 1975, the Respondent, while presiding over the Wayne County District Criminal Court, caused to be stricken by an official of the Court the guilty verdict previously&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  entered in said case and caused to be entered a judgment of not guilty in said case.  That the striking of the judgment entered on January 7, 1975, and the entry of the not guilty verdict on April 16, 1975, was done by Respondent while court was not in session, while the defendant Grimsley was not present, while the Assistant District Attorney Paul Wright, who was prosecuting the docket, was not present and without the knowledge or consent of Assistant District Attorney Paul Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">8. That on December 15, 1975, James Edward Gurganus was charged in criminal action no. 75CR14649, Wayne County, with wilfully and unlawfully operating a motor vehicle on a public street or highway at a speed of 55 miles per hour in a 45 mile per hour zone.  On April 1, 1976, the Respondent dismissed said case not in open court and without the knowledge or consent of the District Attorney or his Assistant Paul Wright, who was scheduled to prosecute the docket on April 5, 1976, when said case was scheduled for trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">9. That on or about September 7, 1973, Respondent wrote a letter to F. Fetzer Mills, a District Court Judge of the Twentieth Judicial District, requesting that Judge Mills enter a judgment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  of Prayer for judgment continued with the payment of cost in a criminal action pending in the District Court of Stanly County wherein C. B. Henson was charged with wilfully and unlawfully operating a motor vehicle on a public street or highway at a speed of 70 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour zone.  Respondent also forwarded to Judge Mills at said time a check dated September 7, 1973, No. 49, drawn on the Southern Bank and Trust Company, payable to the Clerk of Superior Court of Stanly County in the amount of $ 16.00 signed by C. B. Henson, the defendant in said action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">10. That Respondent, while presiding over the District Court of Greene County on or about June 25, 1976, entered or caused to be entered a judgment of 'exceeding a safe speed' in File No. 76CR1279 (wherein Evelyn A. Stancill was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a street or highway at a speed of 68 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour zone).  That said judgment was entered while court was not in session and without the knowledge or consent of the Assistant District Attorney, Ms. Libby Jones, prosecuting the docket on said date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">11. That Respondent, while presiding over the District Court of Greene County&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  on or about June 25, 1976, entered or caused to be entered a judgment of 'exceeding a safe speed' in File No. 76CR1369 (wherein Brantley Hinson was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a street or highway at a speed of 68 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour zone).  That said judgment was entered while court was not in session and without the knowledge or consent of the Assistant District Attorney, Ms. Libby Jones, prosecuting the docket on said date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">12. That the aforesaid findings and this recommendation were concurred in by five or more members of the Judicial Standards Commission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the foregoing findings and conclusions the Commission recommended &quot;that respondent be censured by the Supreme Court for said conduct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent petitioned this Court for a hearing upon the censure recommendation, which was granted, and the proceeding was calendared as Case No. 120 at the Spring Term 1977.  Respondent thereupon filed a brief and was heard through counsel on oral argument before this Court on 14 July 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 18 July 1977, before passing upon the censure recommendation, the Court </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ex mero motu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> set the matter for reargument at the Fall Term on the following questions: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1. Whether this Court may order </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">the removal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> of a judge upon a recommendation to the Court by the Judicial Standards Commission that the judge be censured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2. If so, whether the respondent judge in this case should be removed.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arguments of Respondent and the Commission on these points were heard by this Court on 14 October 1977.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Judicial Standards Commission (North Carolina) recommended that respondent judge be censured. The judge appealed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner-appellant, James N. Duggins, Jr. (Duggins), graduated from the University of North Carolina School of Business in June 1965, with a major in accounting.  In May 1965 he &quot;passed satisfactorily&quot; the examination given by the State Board of Certified Public Accountant Examiners (Board).  However, in addition to passing this examination, at that time N.C. Gen. Stats. &sect; 93-12(5) (1965) also required that an applicant for a certificate of qualification to practice as a certified public accountant (CPA) &quot;shall have had at least two years' experience on the field staff of a certified public accountant or a North Carolina public accountant in public practice, or shall have served two or more years as an internal revenue agent or special agent under a District Director of Internal Revenue or at least two years on the field staff of the North Carolina State Auditor under the direct supervision of a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  certified public accountant and shall have the endorsement of three certified public accountants as to his eligibility.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Advanced degrees in economics or business administration may be substituted for one year of experience.  The statute authorized the Board to permit persons otherwise eligible to take its examination and to withhold certificates until such persons shall have had the required experience.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;By 1975 N.C. Sess. Laws, ch. 107 and 1977 N.C. Sess. Laws, ch. 804, the General Assembly rewrote the second sentence of the second paragraph of G.S. 93-12(5) (1965).  These revisions, however, do not affect Duggins' right of certification.  See N.C. Gen. Stats. 93-12(5) (Cum. Supp. 1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 1965 the Board notified Duggins that his certification was being held &quot;in suspense&quot; until he had acquired the necessary experience and submitted the proof required by rule (9)(c)(1), Section II, Rules of the Board:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Each applicant must submit proof, acceptable to the Board, that he has had:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) At least two years' experience on the field staff of a certified public accountant in public practice or a North Carolina public accountant in public practicee.&quot; (Emphasis Supplied.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;(2) Or, shall have served two or more years as an internal revenue agent or special agent under a District Director of Internal Revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(3) Or, shall have served at least two years on the field staff of the North Carolina State Auditor under the direct supervision of a certified public accountant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(4) A master's or more advanced degree in economics or business administration from an accredited college or university as provided in Rule (9)(b)(2) may be substituted for one year of experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duggins' file remained in suspense until 20 December 1972.  In the meantime, Duggins graduated from the University of North Carolina Law School in the spring of 1968.  In August 1968 he passed the North Carolina Bar Examination and was licensed to practice law in this State.  During the summer months of 1966 and 1967 he worked a total of 939 hours as a staff accountant for a firm of certified public accountants engaged in public practice in Durham, North Carolina.  In the fall of 1968 Duggins joined the law firm of Smith, Moore, Smith, Schell &amp; Hunter of Greensboro.  There he worked under the direct supervision of one of the partners, Richard J. Tuggle, a lawyer and a CPA in good standing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For more than four years Duggins spent over fifty percent of his time working on tax accounting matters under Tuggle's supervision.  In this work he accumulated over 9,000 hours in the preparation of individual, corporate, and fiduciary income tax returns, state inheritance and federal estate tax returns, and in preparing tax protests; in making detailed analysis of financial information, verifications of financial transactions, books, accounts, and records; and in representing taxpayers at the agent level, conference level, and in the appellate division of the Internal Revenue Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 20 December 1972 Duggins applied to the Board for his license as a CPA.  His application, which recited his experience as detailed above, was supported by an affidavit from Mr. Tuggle.  Upon receiving notice that the Board intended to deny his application on the ground that he had not acquired the experience required by G.S. 93-12(5), Duggins requested a public hearing.  At this hearing on 26 May 1973 Duggins testified to the facts summarized above.  In a decision dated 21 August 1973, the Board denied Duggins' application.  In addition to the facts set out above, the Board found as a fact &quot;that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the sole reason the Board rejected [petitioner's] application . . . is that he has been employed under the supervision of a lawyer who is also a CPA and not in the public practice of accountancy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board concluded as a matter of law that &quot;being an employee of a law firm [and] working under the supervision of a lawyer who is also a licensed certified public accountant not in the public practice of accountancy does not meet the experience requirements of the licensing statute and rules of the Board.&quot; Additionally, the Board noted that its administrative interpretation of G.S. &sect; 93-12(5) had long been that &quot;employment by a licensed certified public accountant engaged in the practice of law is not experience which would qualify an applicant for licensing by the Board as a certified public accountant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon Duggins' appeal to the Wake County Superior Court, Judge Bailey reversed the Board's decision and directed it to issue a certificate to Duggins.  The Board appealed this ruling to the Court of Appeals, which held that the Board's interpretation of G.S. 93-12(5) and its decision were in all respects proper.  We granted Duggins' petition to review that decision.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner lawyer sought review of a decision by the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which denied him a license as a certified public accountant (CPA). The trial court had previously reversed a decision by respondent North Carolina State Board of Certified Public Accountant Examiners (board) to deny the lawyer his CPA license for his failure to obtain sufficient experience in the field as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 93-12(5) (1965).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After obtaining a bachelor's degree in accounting and passing the certification examination, the lawyer went on to practice tax law under the direct supervision of another attorney who was also a CPA. The board denied the lawyer his CPA license because he had not had two years' experience on the field staff of a CPA in public practice. The trial court reversed the board, but the appellate court affirmed the board's decision. On further appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the board's interpretation of &sect; 93-12(5) manifested the legislative intent of the statute. The court noted that the statute specifically included the phrase, &quot;in public practice,&quot; which was equivalent to the &quot;public practice of accountancy.&quot; The court also held that the statutory requirements did not violate equal protection or due process because they were rationally related to the legislative purpose of only certifying applicants qualified and prepared to enter public practice by themselves. The court found that, because the challenged classification bore a reasonable relationship to the statute's purpose, the statute could not be set aside merely because it resulted in some inequalities in practice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On certiorari to review decision of the Court of Appeals, 33 N.C. App. 563, which reversed the judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Rousseau, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, dismissing plaintiffs' actions at the 25 October 1976 Regular Civil Session of the Guilford Superior Court, High Point Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a class action brought pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rule 23(a), seeking recovery of monies paid by plaintiffs to the City of High Point for garbage collecting services performed by the city.  Prior to 21 January 1971, the city without charge collected garbage from dumpsters, large metal receptacles, furnished by plaintiffs.  An ordinance, effective 21 January 1971, was enacted by the city which required plaintiffs and others to pay a service charge of $ 4.00 each time the dumpster box was serviced.  The ordinance, Section 10-6 of the High Point Code of Ordinances, in pertinent part, provided:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">(a) The director of public works is authorized to determine the type, size, number and location of containers for the collection of garbage, trash, waste or other refuse and the failure to comply with the director of public works instructions as to same shall result in discontinuance of garbage, waste or trash collection service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">(b) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  All persons, firms or corporations, except single family residences, apartments, and public schools, desiring or required by the director of public works to have dumpster boxes shall pay a fee of four dollars ($ 4.00) each time the dumpster box is serviced, said fee shall be billed monthly and failure to pay the bill within ten (10) days shall result in a discontinuance of service.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to this ordinance, the director of public works directed that all persons, firms and corporations which generated more than 180 gallons of solid waste a week should provide themselves with dumpsters.  Plaintiffs came within this regulation so that failure to provide the dumpsters or pay the service fee would result in loss of garbage removal service by the city.  Plaintiffs refused to pay the service charge, and the city discontinued service on 7 August 1971 and on 9 August plaintiffs, under protest, paid all past due fees.  The city thereupon resumed collection of their garbage.  Plaintiffs continued to pay the required fees for the collection service under protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 19 January 1972, plaintiffs filed suit seeking to have Section 10-6 of the High Point Code of Ordinances declared unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and seeking recovery of sums paid pursuant to that ordinance.  Judge Barbee sitting without a jury heard this cause and entered judgment on 24 November 1975 declaring Section 10-6(a) unconstitutional.  The judgment also declared unconstitutional that portion of Section 10-6(b) of the ordinance which read &quot;or required by the director of public works.&quot; The judgment severed the issue of damages for further trial and declared the issue of constitutionality of the ordinance to be a final judgment subject to review by appeal.  There was no appeal from this judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to 21 January 1971 and to the date that this action was instituted, there was also in effect an ordinance which provided that only persons under the direction of the superintendent of the division of sanitation could remove garbage set out for collection except by the written consent of the superintendent of the sanitation division.  That ordinance is not under attack by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of damages came on to be heard before Rousseau, J., sitting without a jury, on 25 October 1976.  After considering the stipulated facts, exhibits, and other evidence, Judge Rousseau found facts, entered conclusions of law, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dismissed the action.  We quote pertinent portions of his judgment:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1. Prior to January 21, 1971, the Plaintiffs voluntarily purchased and provided &quot;dumpster boxes,&quot; which the City of High Point serviced free of charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">EXCEPTION NO. 1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2. That on January 21, 1971, the Defendant adopted an ordinance amending Chapter 10, Article I, Section 10-6 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of High Point, revised 1957, and that portion of the ordinance not invalidated by the prior judgment entered November 24, 1975, reads as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c14">(b) All persons, firms or corporations, except single family residences, apartments, and public schools, desiring to have dumpster boxes shall pay a fee of four dollars ($ 4.00) each time the dumpster box is serviced, said fee shall be billed monthly and failure to pay the bill within ten (10) days shall result in a discontinuance of service.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3. The fees paid by the Plaintiffs are reasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">EXCEPTION NO. 2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">4. Plaintiffs desired the dumpster service by the City of High Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">EXCEPTION NO. 3</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1. The following provisions of subsection (b) of said ordinance are separable from the invalid provisions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  of said ordinance, do not constitute an invalid delegation of legislative authority, do not improperly discriminate between classes and are not arbitrary or unreasonable:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c14">(b) All persons, firms or corporations, except single family residences, apartments, and public schools, desiring to have dumpster boxes shall pay a fee of four dollars ($ 4.00) each time the dumpster box is serviced, said fee shall be billed monthly and failure to pay the bill within ten (10) days shall result in a discontinuance of service.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2. Payments by Plaintiffs to Defendant of dumpster box service charges under the amended ordinance (Chapter 10, Article I, Section 10-6(b)) were valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">EXCEPTION NO. 4</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3. Plaintiffs have failed to establish that they were </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">required</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> under the invalid provision of the ordinance to have dumpster boxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">EXCEPTION NO. 5</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">4. Plaintiffs have not shown that they ever requested the City not to service their boxes which they could have done under Chapter 10, Article I, Section 10-2 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of High Point.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals, holding that the payments made by plaintiffs to the city were involuntary, reversed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the trial judge and remanded to the Superior Court of Guilford County for entry of judgment in favor of plaintiffs.  We allowed defendant city's petition for discretionary review on 12 September 1977.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, businesses using city garbage collection services, brought a suit against defendant city seeking to have High Point, N.C. Code of Ordinances &sect; 10-6 declared unconstitutional and seeking to recover fees paid. The city filed a petition for discretionary review of a judgment of the COURT OF APPEALS OF NORTH CAROLINA, which held that payments made by the businesses were involuntary and reversing the trial court's dismissal of the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The businesses contended that the collection services were the result of coercion. However, the court distinguished cases relied on by the businesses on the basis that those cases concerned services that were indispensable and the city controlled the only source from which such services could be obtained. Trash removal was not as acute or as indispensable to a business operation as was the furnishing of water or electricity. The businesses never attempted to obtain permission to remove their own garbage or arrange with a private firm for such removal. A municipality could provide the service of collecting and removing garbage as an exercise of police powers delegated to it but was under no compulsion to do so. The court rejected the businesses further argument that their use of dumpster boxes was required by the terms of a public works regulation authorized by &sect; 10-6. The businesses final decision to pay under protest when the service was discontinued dispelled any notion that the service was not desired. The fees charged were validly imposed by the city and the businesses failed to show that payments were made under such coercion as to render them involuntary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon an indictment, proper in form, the defendant was tried for and found guilty of rape in the first degree.  He was sentenced to death in conformity with G.S. 14-21, sentence being imposed prior to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Woodson v. North Carolina</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 428 U.S. 280, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 49 L.Ed. 2d 944 (1976).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State consisted of the testimony of the victim, her personal physician, who examined her in the emergency room of the hospital in Morganton shortly after the alleged offense, and a detective of the Morganton Police Department.  The defendant did not testify and offered no evidence except certain photographs of the scene of the alleged offense, which were placed in evidence by his counsel during cross-examination of the prosecuting witness.  The evidence for the State was to the following effect:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecuting witness was 21 years of age, married and the mother of one child.  She and her husband resided in Morganton and were both students in school.  They did not own an automobile and, in their joint effort to save money, they&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  walked, when possible, to their various destinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was employed at McDonald's Restaurant in Morganton, two or three miles from her home, and got off work at about 9:30 p.m. on 14 February 1976.  She began to walk home, there being a full moon and ample street lights along her route.  After she had been walking 15 or 20 minutes, she was passing a small wooded area.  The defendant, not previously known to her but positively identified by her in court, jumped out from behind some bushes, seized her from behind, placed his hand over her mouth and dragged her down a slight incline into the woods, telling her, &quot;If you scream or try to get away I will kill you.&quot; He struck her three times in the face, damaging her eye so that it was swollen shut upon her arrival at the hospital, loosening the cartilage in her nose, and knocking a number of her teeth loose.  Although she is only five feet, two inches, tall and weighs only 110 pounds, she tried to fight the defendant off by striking him with her pocketbook which he wrenched away from her and threw down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She continued to resist but he forced her to the ground, ripped off most of her clothing and, after physically forcing her to commit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an unnatural sex act, had intercourse with her twice, interspersing these offenses with another unnatural sexual act, which he compelled her to commit by physical force, and then forced into her private parts a beer bottle which he had found at the scene.  The defendant had a slight odor of alcohol about him but did not appear to the prosecuting witness to be drunk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These acts were spread over a period of approximately 45 minutes.  The defendant then appeared to fall asleep and his victim slipped away from him very meagerly clad, the defendant sitting or lying upon the remainder of her clothing which he had removed from her.  She ran to a nearby house, the residents of which called the police who arrived promptly.  She told the detective in charge what had happened and described the location of the offense.  He, being familiar with the area, dispatched other officers thereto and he and the prosecuting witness soon followed them.  Upon their arrival at the scene of the offense, the officers found the defendant still there, sitting or lying upon articles of the clothing he had stripped from the prosecuting witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost immediately, the prosecuting witness and her police officer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  escort arrived at the scene and she, without any prompting by the officers, told them the defendant was the man who had attacked her, she exhibiting substantial fright and distress at the sight of him.  The prosecuting witness was then taken to the hospital and examined by her personal physician who testified as to her injuries and as to the results of his examination, these corroborating her testimony.  Not more than 15 minutes elapsed between her flight from the scene of the attack and her return thereto in company of her police escort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other than the attack upon the imposition of the sentence to death, the defendant's principal contention on appeal is that his court-appointed counsel did not give him adequate representation.  With reference to this contention, the record shows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The offense was committed 14 February 1976.  Counsel was duly appointed 17 February.  Immediately upon his appointment, counsel conferred with the defendant and again conferred with him in the jail, in the presence of the defendant's aunt on 23 February.  A preliminary hearing was held on 25 February and probable cause was found.  Counsel attended this hearing and cross-examined the prosecuting witness, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  no other witness being called.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 8 March, counsel filed with the Superior Court a detailed motion that the defendant be transferred to Dorothea Dix Hospital in Raleigh for psychiatric observation and examination to determine his mental capacity to plead to the then anticipated bill of indictment and to assist his counsel in preparing his defense.  This motion was granted and the defendant was so examined at Dorothea Dix Hospital.  The record does not set forth the full report of the examining psychiatrist, Dr. Groce, but shows that the report was filed with the court with copies to the District Attorney and to counsel for the defendant.  The record further shows that this report, which was not introduced in evidence before the jury, stated that, in the opinion of the examining psychiatrist, the defendant was competent to stand trial, that he understood the nature of the charge against him and the possible penalties in the event of conviction, that he could work with his attorney to prepare his defense and that while he had advised the examining psychiatrist that he was drinking at the time in question, which may have decreased his inhibitions and judgment, &quot;It is doubtful that this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was severe enough to render him unable to know the difference in right and wrong or the nature and consequences of his behavior.&quot; It further stated: &quot;Psychiatric diagnosis: without psychosis, not insane; habitual excessive drinking.&quot; The record further shows that Dr. Groce, the examining psychiatrist, was present in court during the trial but was not called as a witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the approximately nine weeks between the return of the defendant from the hospital and the trial, defendant's counsel conferred on several occasions with the District Attorney in an unsuccessful effort to persuade the State to accept a plea of guilty to rape in the second degree and also endeavored unsuccessfully to obtain from the Military Personnel Record Center in St. Louis, Missouri, specific information concerning the circumstances under which the defendant was discharged from the Army in July, 1974, that discharge being a &quot;general discharge under honorable conditions.&quot; As counsel's negotiations with the District Attorney for such plea bargaining proceeded, counsel ascertained that the defendant had become &quot;more set on his pleading not guilty.&quot; Counsel advised the defendant of counsel's opinion as to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  evidence which would be presented against him at the trial but did not endeavor to persuade him to agree to a plea of guilty of the lesser offense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day that the case was called for trial, counsel appeared and moved for a continuance in order that he might endeavor to arrange a further psychiatric examination of the defendant by a privately employed psychiatrist.  This motion was denied for lack of timeliness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant thereupon entered a plea of &quot;not guilty by reason of mental irresponsibility and insanity.&quot; To this, in the absence of the jury, the State objected for the reason that the defendant had given no prior notice of his intent so to plead and the State was taken by surprise.  After examining the above mentioned report of Dr. Groce, the court inquired of defendant's counsel as to whether he had any evidence with reference to insanity of the defendant other than the statement and report of Dr. Groce.  Upon being advised by counsel that he had no other evidence of insanity, the trial court made findings of fact with reference to the examination of the defendant by Dr. Groce at Dorothea Dix Hospital and the resulting report to the court by Dr. Groce, as above set&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  forth.  The court refused to accept the plea of the defendant as tendered and, thereupon, the defendant entered a plea of &quot;Not guilty&quot; and the trial proceeded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel for the defendant cross-examined each witness for the State, his cross-examination of the prosecuting witness being in substantial detail, the narration thereof in the record being actually longer than the narration of her direct testimony.  He examined the investigating detective, the State's only police officer witness, in detail as to the lighting in the area wherein the State contends the offense was committed for the obvious purpose of discrediting the identification of the defendant by the prosecuting witness.  The testimony of this officer indicated, among other things, that defendant's counsel had, prior to trial, examined the exhibits offered in evidence by the State, consisting of the clothing and other articles found at the scene where the offense is alleged to have been committed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the State's evidence, counsel for the defendant moved for a dismissal of the charge of rape in the first degree, which motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel for the defendant requested the court to instruct the jury&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with reference to intoxication at the time of the alleged offense.  This request was denied.  As above noted, there was no evidence of intoxication except the testimony of the prosecuting witness that she detected a slight odor of alcohol but the defendant did not appear to her to be drunk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the return of the verdict of guilty of first degree rape, counsel requested that the jury be polled, which was done.  Counsel then moved in arrest of judgment, which motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgment sentencing the defendant to death was then entered and counsel gave notice of appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court.  The defendant was allowed 60 days in which to prepare and serve his case on appeal.  The trial court thereupon appointed trial counsel to represent the defendant on his appeal.  Subsequently, counsel moved for and obtained an extension of time for the service of the case on appeal due to the delay of the court reporter in supplying him with a transcript of the trial.  Counsel also applied for and obtained a stay of execution pending his then contemplated appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel then failed to perfect the defendant's appeal to the Supreme Court and the State moved to dismiss the appeal on 29&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  March 1977.  Thereupon, the Superior Court, instead of dismissing the appeal, removed counsel and appointed Mr. Redmond Dill, defendant's present counsel, to &quot;perfect the appeal if that is possible, or if not to seek a writ of certiorari from the North Carolina Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, as the case may be.&quot; The time for perfecting the appeal having expired, Mr. Dill properly petitioned the Supreme Court for the issuance of a writ of certiorari to bring the case before it for review.  This petition was granted and the appeal was duly heard at the Fall Term 1977 upon briefs and oral argument.  In such brief and oral argument, the defendant's present court-appointed counsel did not suggest the existence of any evidence of insanity of the defendant, any other evidence favorable to the defendant or any procedure or tactic in his behalf not taken at the trial which could be taken if a new trial were granted or any other reason to believe that such new trial might lead to a different verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement of the case on appeal, prepared by the defendant's present court-appointed counsel, sets forth nine assignments of error, but in the brief filed by the defendant's present&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court-appointed counsel, the first six of these assignments are expressly abandoned.  The three remaining assignments are: (1) Failure of the trial judge to sentence the defendant according to the terms of G.S. 148-49.1 and G.S. 148-49.4; (2) the imposition of the death penalty; and (3) denial of the defendant's constitutional right to effective counsel for the reason that his court-appointed trial counsel did not effectively represent him.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of his conviction for first degree rape and his death sentence pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-21 by the Burke County Superior Court (North Carolina). The trial court denied defendant's motions for a continuance for further psychiatric examination, a dismissal of the rape charge, and for an instruction on defendant's intoxication at the time of the rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant allegedly grabbed the victim as she was walking in a park and pulled her into some bushes. There he struck her in her face and raped her several times. He also forced her to commit two unnatural sex acts. The victim smelled alcohol on defendant's breath, and when he fell asleep, she ran to get help. She positively identified defendant at the place of the attack. Defendant was transferred to a mental hospital for examination. The examining psychiatrist found that defendant understood the charge, his intoxication at the time of the crime was not severe enough to render him unable to know right from wrong, that he could work with his attorney, and that he was competent to stand trial. The court affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant for first degree rape but remanded his death sentence for the imposition of life imprisonment because N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17 was unconstitutional, consistent with U.S. Supreme Court precedent. The court rejected defendant's contention that his court appointed counsel was ineffective and refused to consider defendant's insanity evidence because defendant failed to present such evidence at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for first degree rape but remanded the case for the entry of a judgment imposing a sentence of life imprisonment rather than a death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McLelland, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 13 December 1976 Session of Wake, at which the defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to imprisonment for life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State was to the following effect:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 2:30 a.m. on 27 February 1976, two deputies of the Sheriff of Wake County, in response to a telephone call for assistance, went to the trailer home of the defendant, a 25 year old white woman.  They found the defendant's three year old daughter, Tonia, lying in the child's bed at the point of death as the result of three .22 caliber pistol bullets fired into her head at close range.  The child died a few minutes after their arrival.  The only other persons in the trailer when the officers arrived were the defendant and a female neighbor, who had come in response to a call from the defendant and who had called the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant then told the officers that, after putting the child to bed, she went into the living room and lay down upon the couch and fell asleep.  She was awakened by shots, following which she heard someone, not seen by her, go out the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">back</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> door, whereupon she ran into the child's room, observed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the child and then went into her own bedroom to get her pistol but found it missing from the place where she kept it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant's .22 caliber, six shot revolver was found on the bottom back step of the trailer.  It contained three live rounds of ammunition and three shell casings from which the bullets had been fired.  In the opinion of a ballistics expert, two of the three bullets removed from the child's head in the course of an autopsy were fired from this pistol, the third bullet bearing some characteristics of a bullet so fired but not enough to make a positive determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bloodhound, promptly called by the investigating officers to the scene, was unable to pick up a scent.  The back steps of the trailer were in such bad condition that care had to be used in descending them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the investigating officers requested the defendant to allow them to make a test for the presence of gunshot residue upon her hands, she told the officers she had fired her pistol at target practice in her backyard that afternoon.  Shortly thereafter, she told them that, following her discovery of the wounded child, she observed the pistol on the floor of the trailer corridor, kicked it out&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the back door and then, while hysterical, picked it up and fired it one time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no evidence of a forcible entry of the trailer.  The only finger or palm prints found on the frame of the rear door of the trailer and on the nearby wall were those of the defendant and David Stephenson, a married man separated from his wife, who had been living in the trailer with the defendant for several days preceding the shooting but who had departed several hours prior thereto.  No fingerprints were lifted from the pistol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant told the officers she had heard prowlers about her trailer on other occasions and that she had previously so informed the sheriff's office of this by telephone.  The sheriff's office had no record of such complaint by her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was married to Joel Turner when she was 16.  By that marriage she had a son named Timmy.  That marriage ended in divorce.  She then married Tony Jones, the father of Tonia.  Thereafter, Timmy was run over by an automobile and rendered permanently and completely helpless.  The defendant being physically unable to care for him regularly, Timmy has lived, since his injury, with her parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant's second marriage&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was an unhappy one and she and Jones separated two years after the birth of Tonia.  Shortly thereafter, Jones came to the home of the defendant's grandmother, where the defendant and Tonia were then living, and, while there, was killed by four gunshots.  The defendant told the officers that he was killed in a struggle with her grandmother after Jones had drawn a gun from his pocket, pointed it at the defendant and stated he was going to kill her and Tonia.  The defendant's relations with her Jones in-laws were not pleasant, they being of the opinion that she had killed Jones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after her marriage with Jones, the defendant was manager of the toy department at Woolworth's store in the North Hills Shopping Center in Raleigh.  Later, she assisted Jones in his business.  Following his death, she drew Social Security and veteran's compensation benefits as his widow and the mother of his minor child.  After his death, she purchased for $ 10,000 the trailer in which she and Tonia were living when the child was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the accident to her son Timmy, the defendant received a settlement payment for Timmy's benefit.  Since he was being cared for by her parents, the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  used part of this settlement money to buy the trailer, to buy a car, to buy herself a diamond ring and to buy clothing and other things for Tonia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately six weeks prior to the shooting of Tonia, the defendant was negotiating for the purchase of a house for $ 42,500, telling the realtor handling the sale that she intended to pay for it by the sale of her property plus funds from an insurance policy in the amount of $ 40,000 upon the life of Jones.  In November, 1975, the defendant sought assistance from the State Commissioner of Insurance in the collection of this policy, the company having refused to pay on the ground that it had lapsed for non-payment of premiums.  In December, approximately two months prior to the shooting of Tonia, the Insurance Department advised the defendant that, in all probability, the policy was not going to be paid unless she could produce proof that the premiums had been paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April, 1975, nearly a year prior to the shooting of Tonia, the defendant applied for and procured a policy of insurance on the life of Tonia in the amount of $ 30,000, payable to the defendant, at the same time taking a similar policy on her own life.  Three months thereafter, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  she applied to a different company for another policy of $ 20,000, payable to herself, on Tonia's life.  No policy was issued on that application because the defendant failed to submit a necessary report to the company.  Thereafter, on 5 November 1975, the same date on which she sought aid of the Commissioner of Insurance with reference to the policy upon the life of her husband, Tony Jones, the defendant reapplied for such policy upon the life of Tonia, stating in this application that there was no other insurance on the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of February 26, a few hours prior to the shooting of Tonia, as Stephenson was preparing to leave the trailer to return to his own apartment for the night, the defendant, expressing regret that he was leaving, said, &quot;I feel like I have been burdened with children all my life and there is [sic] just some things I want to do.&quot; When Stephenson returned to the trailer after the shooting, he began to cry.  The defendant put her arms around him and told him not to cry, saying she needed him and, &quot;That is the last of Tony.&quot; Stephenson never saw her cry or give any other indication of being upset concerning Tonia's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the time of the first&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  officers' arrival at the trailer at 2:30 a.m. on February 27 until approximately 6:00 p.m. on March 4, the various investigating officers talked with and questioned the defendant on numerous different occasions, she being in their presence for a total of about 39 hours, including numerous interruptions of the interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a subsequent interview, she told the officers that she did not know if she had fired the gun when she came upon it after discovering the wounded child.  In a still later interview on March 3, the officers told the defendant they had interviewed Stephenson and had taken &quot;three empty casings from his gun.&quot; The defendant looked a bit startled, paused for several minutes, and then told the officers that Stephenson shot the child, that she, herself, had been struck on the head, had heard shots, had heard Tonia scream, had seen Stephenson come from that area of the trailer and walk through the living room, get in his car and leave.  She told the officers that Stephenson knew about the insurance on Tonia's life and, after Tonia was killed, Stephenson said to her: &quot;Now Tony is really gone.  All of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the following day, March 4, the defendant again told the officers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that Stephenson had killed the child.  At that point, the officers brought Stephenson into the interview and she asked him if he did it.  Stephenson told the defendant to tell the officers the truth and said that she was trying to cause him, Stephenson, to receive a life sentence for something he did not do.  Thereupon, Stephenson and the officers left the interview for the giving of a polygraph test to Stephenson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following that interview on March 4, a warrant, charging the defendant with murder, was served upon her and read to her by the officers.  At that point, Deputy Sheriff Munn entered the interview and asked the defendant if there was anything she wanted to tell the officers.  He told her that the officers had &quot;all the pieces to the puzzle except one and she had that one blocked out&quot; and that Stephenson was not part of the puzzle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Deputy Munn asked the defendant to &quot;come out with it,&quot; she stated, &quot;I am trying.&quot; He then asked her, &quot;Why did you shoot Tonia?&quot; She replied, &quot;I don't know.&quot; When asked again, she said, &quot;I don't have a reason.&quot; Deputy Munn then asked, &quot;How close were you when you fired the shots?&quot; She replied, &quot;Real close.&quot; He asked her, &quot;Did you put the gun&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to Tonia's temple?&quot; She replied: &quot;Close to it.  I don't remember all of it.  I don't remember thinking anything.  I don't know why I did it.  Tonia didn't say anything.  I don't remember what I did then.  I kicked the gun out the door and remember picking myself up.&quot; She continued: &quot;I remember shooting Tonia one time and I remember I could not stop shooting.  I remember standing beside her bed.  A lot of this, I guess I blocked it out.  I'm sorry.  Oh, God, I'm sorry.&quot; Again, she said: &quot;I loved her.  She was all I had.  Back in my mind I don't know why I shot her.  The only thing I can think of was may-be to save her from the life I have had.  I didn't want her to live in the same hell.  I remember laying on the couch thinking about things which have been done to me in the past; heartaches and the pains.  I guess I loved her too much.  I wanted to spare her from the pain * * * I got up and went through the kitchen and into the bedroom where I got the gun.  I went to Tonia's room and started shooting.  I then went down the hall to the back door and kicked the gun out the back door.  I fell.  I then went back to Tonia's room and saw her and I screamed.  I then went and locked the back&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  door and called Linda [the neighbor who was present when the first officers arrived at the trailer].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the defendant was arrested and charged with the murder on March 4, Stephenson again talked to her with no officers present.  He asked her why she had killed Tonia and she replied, &quot;Because I didn't want to see Tonia hurt like I am hurt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the warrant was served upon the defendant and she was taken into custody, the officers left her in the interview room in the sheriff's office in the company of her father.  Unknown to them, Deputy Stewart observed them through a one-way mirror and heard their conversation.  No one else was present in the interview room with the defendant and her father.  The defendant was crying when her father entered the room and said, in effect, &quot;Kathy, you did it didn't you?&quot; The defendant replied that she did.  When her father asked her why, the defendant replied that she did not know.  (Both the defendant and her father, who testified as a witness for her, denied that she made this statement, each saying that her statement was that the officers wanted her to say she did it but she did not.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On at least six different occasions, scattered through&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the entire period of interviews from February 27 to March 4, the defendant was informed by the officers of her constitutional rights, pursuant to the Miranda formula, and on at least three different occasions she signed written waivers of those rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, the investigating officers did not consider the defendant a suspect but became increasingly suspicious of her complicity in or responsibility for the murder of the child as inconsistencies appeared in her various statements and repetitions of her narrative of the offense.  One of the officers who first arrived at the trailer took the defendant out to his patrol car and talked to her there because of the confusion in the trailer incident to the investigation.  This interview was interrupted several times.  He gave her the &quot;Miranda warning&quot; after she told him she had fired the pistol once when she found it on the ground behind the trailer, he knowing there were only three spent shells in the revolver and that there were three bullets in the child's head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, this officer took the defendant to the sheriff's office in order to obtain a recorded statement.  He and succeeding investigators then interviewed the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  several times throughout the day, February 27.  There were frequent interruptions of these interviews and the defendant had access to water and the rest room, smoked at will and was offered food and coffee, which she declined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one of these interviews, late in the afternoon, the officers took her back to her trailer.  She fixed herself a &quot;mixed drink&quot; and offered to fix like drinks for the officers, which offer they declined.  She went through the trailer with them and into the child's room.  She sat on the child's bed, the covers of which were heavily stained with blood.  She showed no emotion whatever.  (In her own testimony the defendant flatly contradicted this testimony of the officers and said that one of them forced her face down into the blood-stained covers.  This the officers, called in rebuttal, categorically denied.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In between the various interviews with the officers, scattered over the entire week, the defendant was permitted to return to her trailer, or to the home of her parents, and, on at least one occasion, she and Stephenson went to his apartment.  During part of the interviews her parents and sister were also in the sheriff's outer office and, between interviews, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  she talked with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 28, the officers followed the defendant to the funeral home and into the room where she was arranging her child's hair for burial.  When she demanded that they leave, they did so.  They also attended the child's funeral on February 29 to observe the defendant's demeanor.  According to the officers, she showed very little emotion at the funeral.  The officers did not interview the defendant on February 29, March 1 or March 2, she being with her parents in their home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While interviewing the defendant in the child's bedroom on February 27, as she sat on the bloodstained bed, the officers, observing her lack of emotion, began to consider her a definite suspect and their interrogations became more vigorous.  Nevertheless, she admitted nothing implicating her in the shooting, saying to the interrogating officer: &quot;I haven't admitted anything.  I need time to think.&quot; The officer then told the defendant he did not believe things had happened the way she told it and did not believe any intruder had come into the house and shot Tonia.  She then requested time to take a bath and think.  She was permitted to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout all interviews until March 3, when&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  she said Stephenson shot the child, she adhered to her original story that an unknown intruder had done the shooting.  No threats or promises were made to the defendant, no one yelled at her, no one accused her of killing her daughter or told her that she was mentally ill in any of the various interviews scattered over the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant's own testimony was to the following effect: She denied shooting Tonia, denied any lack of emotion concerning her death, denied making the alleged confession to which the officers testified and charged the officers with harassment of her by making her sit upon the child's bloodstained bed, pushing her face down upon the blood stains, and showing her photographs of the child's body.  To the best of her knowledge, the doors of the trailer were locked when she lay down on the couch prior to the shooting.  She was lying there hoping that Stephenson would return and she fell asleep.  The next thing she remembers is &quot;something coming toward my face&quot; like a cloth.  She does not know if she was struck or if anything was put up to her nose.  The next thing she remembers was some strange noise.  She tried to get up but was unable to do so.  She then saw&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a man &quot;coming at an angle going through my kitchen out my </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">front</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> door,&quot; who said: &quot;Now, Tony is dead.  All of Tony is dead now.&quot; In her testimony she did not identify this man as Stephenson.  She then ran to the child's bedroom, saw the wounded child and went to get her gun but it was not in her own bedroom where she kept it.  As she passed the child's bedroom again, she saw the gun lying in the hallway.  She opened the back door and kicked the gun out of the back door, her reason for doing so not being known to her.  She positively did not shoot the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant's parents and a number of her neighbors, including some who were called as witnesses for the State, testified to the defendant's affectionate care of Tonia and to her definite display of emotion during the week following the child's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Robert Rollins, an expert psychiatrist, called as a witness for the defendant, testified that, in his opinion, the defendant was under &quot;extreme stress and duress&quot; throughout the course of the interrogation, saying: &quot;It seems to me that the major stressful points would be that she was required to remain alone on occasions.  She asked to leave, was not allowed to.  There was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  repeated questioning.  The situation was confusing to her; she was required to go into Tonia's bedroom; she was shown photographs; there were intimidating statements, promises made, false assurances, false information, statements about God; the absence of female deputies; the continued interrogations; the failure to inform her of the limits of the restraint and the actual intent of the process.  These, I would judge to be the major stressful factors.&quot; This testimony by Dr. Rollins was predicated upon his having heard the testimony of the other witnesses, including the investigating officers, and was in response to a lengthy hypothetical question which is not set forth in the record but which the record states, &quot;reviewed the facts of the case as set forth in this record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Rollins then testified: &quot;My evaluation of facts that you have put forth would be that this degree of stress would substantially impair the defendant's judgment and reasoning; that she would not be able to make a valid statement and my assessment of the process is that her major motivation was to terminate this harassment and in my assessment at this point she would have done anything to terminate that process.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On cross-examination, Dr. Rollins testified: &quot;I have made no evaluation of the sanity of the defendant.  The conclusion I have reached is only as strong as the facts assumed in the hypothetical which took fifteen minutes to read in court.  If those facts were in error then I would have to restate my assessment.  I was assuming facts as stated on the information in the hypothetical which included promises on the parts of the officers, false assurances and a failure to inform her of the possible termination of this process including specifically the drawing of the warrant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the above mentioned evidence as to statements allegedly made by her, for the reason that such statements were obtained in violation of her right to counsel and were not understandingly, voluntarily and intelligently made without coercion or duress.  A full pretrial hearing upon this motion was conducted by Judge Godwin.  At that hearing, the evidence for the State and for the defendant (including testimony by Dr. Rollins), concerning the length, nature and duration of the several interrogations of the defendant, was substantially in accord with the above summary of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the evidence given before the jury concerning these matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the pretrial hearing, Judge Godwin entered a formal order, including detailed findings of fact, these findings being substantially in accord with the testimony of the investigating officers.  Upon these findings, he concluded that, on the occasion of each interview, the defendant was advised of her constitutional rights and that all statements of the defendant, both those which were inculpatory and those which tended to be exculpatory, were made after she was so advised and that these were made freely, understandingly, knowingly, and voluntarily, with full knowledge of her constitutional rights.  Accordingly, Judge Godwin concluded that her statements to the officers were legally competent to be received in evidence and denied the motion to suppress.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We allowed discretionary review of the decision of the Court of Appeals, 33 N.C.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, a Delaware corporation, instituted this civil action to recover a portion of certain excise taxes paid on the distribution of its soft drink known as &quot;Hi-C.&quot; The taxes were collected pursuant to G.S. 105-113.45, which levied an excise tax of one cent per bottle on the &quot;. . . sale, use, handling and distribution of all soft drinks . . .&quot; in North Carolina.  Under G.S. 105-113.51, the tax could be paid by affixing North Carolina taxpaid stamps or crowns to the soft drink containers.  G.S. 105-113.56A afforded resident dealers and distributors an alternative means of payment whereby sales reports could be made to the Secretary of Revenue each month and a tax paid as follows: &quot;For the first fifteen thousand gross of bottled soft drinks sold annually, seventy-two cents (72 cents) per gross; for all in excess of fifteen thousand gross, one cent (1 cent) per bottle.  In addition, there shall be allowed a discount of eight percent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (8%) of the said tax to be remitted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restriction of this lower tax rate and less burdensome method of payment to resident dealers and distributors was held by the Court of Appeals to be violative of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Richmond Food Stores v. Jones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 22 N.C. App. 272, 206 S.E. 2d 346 (1974). The Secretary of Revenue did not seek discretionary review of that decision in our Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the tax years ending 30 September 1971, 1972, 1973 and 1974, plaintiff manufactured and distributed &quot;Hi-C&quot; in North Carolina and paid the soft drink excise tax by purchasing and affixing taxpaid crowns or stamps to its containers pursuant to G.S. 105-113.51, since it was not a North Carolina distributor and had not established a commercial domicile here.  On several occasions during this period, plaintiff inquired of an official in the Department of Revenue whether it might utilize the alternate method of payment under G.S. 105-113.56A.  The Department responded that the law did not permit plaintiff to use the alternate method.  Relying on this, plaintiff continued to pay the tax without protest by means of taxpaid lids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Richmond</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Food Stores v.

This claim for refund was denied and plaintiff filed suit.  At trial, the court granted summary judgment for defendant as to plaintiff's claim for refund for the tax year ending 30 September 1971, since this claim was barred by the three year time limitation in G.S. 105-266.1(a).  After the presentation of evidence was concluded, the court found for plaintiff and entered judgment granting a refund of $ 32,400, representing an overpayment of $ 10,800 for each of the three tax years in question.  Defendant appealed from that judgment and, as indicated above, the Court of Appeals reversed.  No appeal was taken from the partial summary judgment for defendant.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon a bill of indictment charging that on 24 September 1975 in the nighttime defendant broke and entered the occupied sleeping apartment of Betty Barnette located at 106 Virginia Street, Morganton, North Carolina, with intent to commit a felony therein, to wit: assault with intent to commit rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that Betty Barnette, 26-year-old wife of Ernest (Eddie) Barnette, lived in an apartment at 106-C Virginia Street in Morganton with her husband and two small children.  Her husband worked at Greak Lakes Carbon Company and usually came home about midnight.  The Barnette apartment had three rooms on the ground level and three rooms on the second level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around midnight on 23 September 1975 Betty Barnette was asleep in an upstairs bedroom while her two children were sleeping in a separate room.  She heard a knock at the front door and, thinking it was her husband, went downstairs to open the door.  She asked &quot;Who is there?&quot; and a voice said &quot;This is Eddie.&quot; She cracked the door and defendant was standing outside.  She&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  quickly pushed the door shut despite his efforts to prevent it.  Defendant then entered the Barnette apartment through a front window located beside the door.  Mrs. Barnette started screaming, ran upstairs and left the house through a window in the children's bedroom.  Jumping from the roof to the ground, she injured her foot and could not get up.  The defendant then jumped off the roof and, in the words of Mrs. Barnette, &quot;he got me down on the ground and was half choking me to death and I had bruises all over me where he grabbed me.  He kissed me and then he told me we had better leave, to get up and leave and at that time the next door neighbor came out.  I saw the next door neighbor.  The defendant just told me that I had better get up and to keep my mouth shut or he would kill me. . . .  He was on top of me and choking me and he put his hand around my neck.  He was in between my legs . . . and holding me down and he threatened me if I moved.  He said he would kill me if I moved. . . .  He kissed me on the mouth.  I hit the ground after I jumped.  I was hurt on the bottom of my foot.  It was cut.  I could not walk.  Roger Michaux was the neighbor that came out there to see me.  I&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was on the ground about five minutes with the defendant before Mr. Michaux came out there.  I don't know what time the defendant left me there.  He left because this Roger came out and told him to leave; that he had better leave and get out of there, to leave me alone.  After Roger Michaux told him that, the defendant just walked off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Michaux, 24-year-old black man, lived with his wife in Apartment 106-D Virginia Street in Morganton on 23 September 1975.  The Michaux apartment was next door to Mrs. Barnette's.  Roger Michaux had known defendant all his life.  On two or three occasions defendant had passed through that area asking who lived in the neighborhood, and Mr. Michaux had mentioned the names of those living in the apartments, including the name of Betty Barnette and her husband.  Roger Michaux testified that on the night in question, about midnight, he heard a lot of scuffling and opened his door to see what was happening.  He saw Roger Caldwell who had Mrs. Barnette up against a wall and was pressing up against her.  He told defendant to leave her alone but he ignored the warning and &quot;went back to what he was doing.&quot; Mr. Michaux told him again to quit &quot;before I have&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to stop you.&quot; Defendant then backed off and as he walked past Michaux he said: &quot;Don't mention anything about this, man.  Don't mention anything about what I saw. . . .  You have not seen me, don't say anything about it.&quot; Defendant then disappeared and Michaux's wife came out of the Michaux apartment, &quot;saw Betty and helped her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Dennis Short received a call at his home at approximately 1 a.m. on 24 September 1975 as a result of which he talked with Mrs. Barnette and she gave him a description of her assailant and told him what had occurred.  Defendant was apprehended on the afternoon of the same day, taken to the police station and advised of his rights.  Officer Short observed defendant walking around the police department and observed his expressions.  Defendant walked normally and had a worried expression on his face.  There was no odor of alcohol about him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant did not testify but offered evidence.  Dr. James Groce, a psychiatrist at Dorothea Dix Hospital, testified that he examined defendant on 16 October 1975 and observed him over a period of time.  Defendant's IQ was 91, and on the Competency Screening Test he scored 36, &quot;well within the range of competency&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to stand trial.&quot; It was Dr. Groce's expert opinion, however, that it was &quot;unlikely&quot; that defendant knew the difference between right and wrong and the nature and consequences of his behavior on the night of 24 September 1975.  Defendant's mother and Robert Hodges, an attorney who had previously represented defendant in other matters, testified that defendant appeared to be confused following the episode in question, could not say why he was in jail, seemed unable to converse intelligently or to relate any of the facts concerning the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court submitted four permissible verdicts: Guilty of first degree burglary, guilty of non-felonious breaking or entering, not guilty by reason of insanity, or not guilty.  Defendant was convicted of first degree burglary and sentenced to life imprisonment.  He appealed to the Supreme Court assigning errors noted in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

The jury found that he entered with an intent to commit an assault with intent to commit rape. On appeal, defendant alleged that a recent United States Supreme Court case had made it improper for the trial court to place the burden of proof on him with respect to his insanity defense. In affirming the conviction, the court ruled that in North Carolina, insanity was an affirmative defense that was to be proved to the satisfaction of the jury by every accused who pleaded it. The presumption of sanity existed, but was rebuttable. The United States Supreme Court decision did not reallocate the burden of proof. The court also found that the trial court properly instructed the jury with respect to the crime of assault with intent to commit rape. Whether an ulterior criminal intent existed in the mind of defendant had to be inferred and found from other facts, which in their nature were the subject of specific proof. It was to be left to the jury to determine, from all the facts and circumstances, whether or not the ulterior criminal intent existed at the time of the breaking and entry.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the judge's conduct merited censure in accordance with the commission's recommendation. The court reasoned that the judge improperly deprived the prosecutor of the opportunity to participate in the disposition of the cases in question and improperly removed the proceedings from the public domain. While the court found no evidence that the judge's conduct was directed toward any personal gain or amounted to moral turpitude, dishonesty, or corruption, it concluded that the ex parte disposition of the criminal case out of court amounted to conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant Hardy, upon being arraigned, tendered a plea of guilty to accessory after the fact of murder and robbery to the State, but this plea was not accepted by the State.  Defendant Hardy refused to plead further so the court entered a plea of not guilty for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial commenced on 7 June 1976.  The jury&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was selected after four full days of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> examination.  Defendants were found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hardy, aged 24, Folston, aged 19, and Green, aged 17, were at a lounge in Asheville, North Carolina, on the evening of 30 July 1975, and decided to go to Durham, North Carolina.  They borrowed Hardy's sister's car, a 1971 Chevelle for the trip.  Hardy transferred a shotgun from his car to his sister's car.  During the early morning hours of 31 July 1975, the three left Asheville and proceeded east on Interstate 40.  Hardy operated the vehicle.  Folston rode on the passenger side of the front seat and Green rode in the rear.  Before leaving Asheville, defendants each took a purple pill to stay awake which had the effect of increasing their laughter and talking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 4:30 a.m., they arrived in the vicinity of Morganton, Burke County, North Carolina.  They left Interstate 40 and pulled into a nearby Shell Service Station where Darrell Monroe Baldridge, the deceased, was working as a service station attendant and Vernon Robert Fragiacomo, a hitchhiker, was waiting for a ride to Richmond, Virginia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Green and Folston went inside the station to use the restroom and to buy drinks from the drink machine.  Hardy stayed at the automobile and purchased $ 2.00 worth of gasoline.  He conversed with the deceased, Baldridge, and also with the hitchhiker, Fragiacomo.  Folston returned and asked the attendant for change for a dollar.  Green and Folston followed Baldridge into the service station.  Inside Baldridge was forced to open the cash register.  At gunpoint Folston and Green took cash from the register and a .38 caliber pistol belonging to the station owner.  According to Green's testimony, he then left the building and on his way to the car, heard a shot fired which resulted in the death of the service station attendant, Baldridge.  Fragiacomo testified that Folston and Green were both inside the station at the time the fatal shot was fired.  Through the window, Fragiacomo was able to observe Baldridge lying spreadeagle on the floor and saw the expression leave his face when the shooting occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baldridge lived unconscious for six days.  The cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.  A .22 caliber bullet was removed from his brain, but the bullet was so mutilated it could&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not be identified as having come from a .22 caliber pistol that was later recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the shooting, Hardy threatened Fragiacomo with the same fate and ordered him to get into the car.  When Folston and Green returned to the car, defendant Hardy drove east on Interstate 40 in the general direction of Durham, North Carolina, until coming to a detour near Hickory.  A sheriff's car was parked along the road so Hardy asked the officer where Interstate 40 continued.  They had traveled a short distance when they were pulled over into a shopping center parking lot by officers of the Hickory Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One patrolman approached the driver's side and asked Hardy for his driver's license and registration.  The officers observed a shotgun in the hands of Green who was sitting in the rear seat and pulled their pistols.  Defendants Hardy and Folston were directed to lay their hands on the dashboard.  At this point, defendant Hardy shifted the car into gear and drove off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A high speed chase ensued during which gunshots were fired from the vehicle being pursued.  The Chevelle traveled west on Highway 64-70.  Eventually, Hardy lost control of the vehicle in Pottery or Deadman's Curve&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and wrecked it.  Folston and Green were taken into custody at the scene of the wreck.  Defendant Hardy was apprehended in a field about four-tenths of a mile from the site of the accident two hours later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fragiacomo was treated at a hospital.  After his release, he continued to receive medical and psychiatric attention for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cash register tape at the service station showed sales, including cash and credit, of some $ 1,400.00 for the day of the robbery.  $ 248.00 and some change were recovered from under the right front floor mat of the Chevelle.  At the scene of the wreck, two guns were found outside the car, and one gun and a shotgun were recovered from inside the automobile, including a .22 caliber pistol and the .38 caliber pistol stolen from the service station.  At some earlier time, the lawful license plate for the Chevelle had been removed and another license plate substituted therefor.  The lawful plate was found under the right-hand side of the front seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cross-examination of co-defendant Green revealed that he was testifying under a plea-bargain arrangement whereby he agreed to plead guilty to the reduced charge of second-degree murder and to testify truthfully&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the trials against Hardy and Folston in exchange for a sentence of no more than sixty years and dismissal of the other charges against him.  Kevin Green was also known as &quot;Clyde,&quot; apparently for &quot;Bonnie and Clyde.&quot; The initials &quot;B &amp; C&quot; were tatooed on his arm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Green indicated that the purpose of the trip to Durham was for defendant Hardy to see someone concerning the publication of a book he had written entitled &quot;Legacy of a Black Man.&quot; After the wreck, Hardy's brief case and some papers were found strewn all over the highway.  The papers and brief case were recovered by the officers and returned to Hardy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Folston offered no evidence.  Defendant Hardy offered a number of character witnesses, including the Chancellor and the Dean of Students at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, which school Hardy had attended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other facts necessary to the decision will be discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed the judgments of the Special Criminal Session, Cleveland County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted defendants of first-degree murder and sentenced defendants to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants sought review of their first-degree murder convictions in their consolidated trial and the death sentences imposed. The court held that (1) the trial court properly denied the motions to quash the indictments on the basis that defendants failed to demonstrate that there was an arbitrary and systematic exclusion of blacks, women, and 18 to 21 year olds from the grand and petit juries; (2) the trial court properly denied defendants' motion for severance because the evidence showed that the codefendant's statement which implicated them in the crime was admissible against them in their joint trial as an implied admission; (3) the trial court did not err in failing to strike the testimony of a witness or to grant a mistrial for the failure of the state to provide a prior recorded statement of the witness as per a pretrial discovery order because the state was not required to divulge the statement prior to trial. The court vacated the death sentences and imposed life sentences because the United States Supreme Court invalidated the death penalty provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17 (Cum. Supp. 1975) under which defendants were sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgments of the trial court but vacated the death sentences. The court remanded the case to the trial court to enter sentences for life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon a bill of indictment, proper in form, charging him with the first degree murder of Richard Linwood Holloman on 13 February 1976 in Wilson County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered evidence tending to show that on 13 February 1976 at approxomately 9 p.m. the deceased, Richard Linwood Holloman, and his employee, Lester Floyd Jones, were closing Mr. Holloman's grocery store and service station located on N.C. Highway 117 south of Wilson, North Carolina.  The lights in the store had been turned off and the front door locked with a padlock.  Holloman and Jones were standing in front of the store talking when three black males walked up.  One of them asked if he could get an Alka-Seltzer and Mr. Holloman said, &quot;I reckon so.&quot; At that time Mr. Holloman had his .32 caliber pistol in his hand in full view.  He unlocked the padlock on the front door with his left hand, holding the pistol in his right hand.  Holloman and Jones then entered the store followed by two black males.  There were no lights on in the store except the lights around a clock.  However, there were two windows in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  front of the store, one on each side of the door, and there was a row of lights under the roof of the building all the way around -- six lights on the front with hundred watt bulbs on the two corners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Holloman got an Alka-Seltzer off the shelf with his left hand and asked the black male if he wanted a cup.  The black man replied, &quot;Yes, and your money too.&quot; Mr. Holloman replied, &quot;Money, hell,&quot; whereupon the black man pulled a sawed-off shotgun and both he and Mr. Holloman fired their weapons.  Mr. Jones jumped behind a counter on his stomach and heard additional shots being fired.  Immediately following the shooting the three black males left.  Mr. Jones called the rescue squad and Mr. Holloman was taken to Wilson Memorial Hospital where he later died from gunshot wounds under his collarbone on the right side and under the right shoulder blade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the officers arrived on the scene Lester Floyd Jones furnished a description of the three black males.  He told the officers the man with the sawed-off shotgun was from 5 feet 9 inches to 6 feet tall, weighed 150 to 165 pounds, thirty to thirty-five years of age, and was wearing a dark coat, light shirt and dark pants, with part of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a woman's light colored stocking on his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that night defendant Charles Ray Finch, in company with one Charles Lewis, was driving his blue Cadillac on East Nash Street in the City of Wilson and was stopped by several police officers who arrested him without a warrant.  He and Charles Lewis were taken to the Wilson County Courthouse where defendant's automobile was searched.  A shotgun shell was found in the ashtray in the left rear door of the car.  That same night at approximately 1 a.m. defendant was placed in a lineup with six other people and Lester Floyd Jones identified defendant as the man who shot Mr. Holloman.  The witness Jones so testified at the trial and made an in-court identification of defendant as the man who shot Mr. Holloman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant did not testify but offered several other witnesses who testified that at 9 p.m. on 13 February 1976 when Mr. Holloman was shot, defendant was in a poker game at Tom Smith's Shoeshine Parlor on East Nash Street in downtown Wilson.  These witnesses testified in detail as to defendant's activities on the night in question and were positive in their testimony that defendant was at the shoeshine parlor or in the downtown Wilson&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  area at the time Mr. Holloman was shot at his place of business on N.C. Highway 117 several miles away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was convicted of felony murder and sentenced to death.  He appealed to the Supreme Court assigning numerous errors which will be discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of his conviction by the Wilson Superior Court (North Carolina) that had convicted him of first degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of his conviction of first degree murder. Defendant contended that the court impermissibly informed the jury that the case would be reviewed by an appellate court in the event a guilty verdict was returned. Defendant argued this lightened the burden of the jury. The court stated there was no suggestion to the jury that its verdict was somehow less binding because of later opportunities for review. The court failed to see how defendant had been prejudiced by the judge's remarks. Defendant contended that his constitutional rights were violated by the exclusion of jurors who expressed scruples against the death penalty. The court found this contention meritless. Defendant argued the denial of his motion for mistrial during jury selection was an error. The judge had excused the jurors who had made comments concerning defendant's guilt; thus the court held a mistrial was not necessitated. Defendant assigned as error the admission of evidence identifying the defendant as the man wielding the shotgun. The court found no merit in this assignment. Thus, the conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the conviction and remanded the case for resentencing because the death penalty had been outlawed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon a bill of indictment, proper in form, charging that between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. in the night of 13 July 1976, with force and arms, defendant feloniously and burglariously broke and entered the occupied dwelling house of Barbara White, 700-B Imperial Street, Greenville, North Carolina, with intent, feloniously, and burglariously, to steal, take and carry away the goods and chattels of Barbara White located in said dwelling house, specifically one Schwinn 10-speed bicycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Barbara White testified that on 13 July 1976 she lived with her husband, Willie Andrew White, at 700-B Imperial Street in Greenville.  This apartment consists of three rooms -- a living room on the front, a bedroom in the middle and a kitchen on the back with a bath closed in on the porch.  A front door leads to the living room and a back door leads out of the kitchen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. White testified that she got off work at 10:30 p.m. on 13 July 1976 and, upon arriving home, prepared her clothing for the next day's work and then locked the doors.  No windows were open -- &quot;they had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been nailed down.&quot; Her husband was not at home and, according to custom, she left the kitchen light on and went to bed.  Her husband owned a 10-speed Schwinn bicycle and when she went to bed it was parked on the living room floor.  She awoke sometime during the night, about 1:00 or 1:30 a.m., and saw two men, one standing over her and the other with the bicycle pushing it toward the kitchen.  She screamed and while the intruders ran out the back door, she ran out the front door.  She did not recognize the man standing over her but earlier in the summer had seen the person who was pushing the bicycle.  She said: &quot;I didn't know his name, all I knew he was Sister Wilson's son, one of Sister Wilson's sons.  He's not a personal friend of mine, but I knew Sister Wilson had a lot of children.&quot; Following a voir dire, she was permitted to identify defendant in court.  She said he was wearing a black hat and old &quot;railroadman-type&quot; gloves.  &quot;The hat had rubber in the back of it and it had a cap-like bill with a piece across.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When her husband got home she told him one of the burglars was Sister Wilson's son and that she didn't know the other person.  They called the police.  An examination of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the apartment disclosed that the kitchen window had been forced open.  The screen had been taken off and was lying on the grass in the backyard beside the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several days later Mrs. White made a photographic identification of defendant as the person in her house pushing the bicycle on the night in question.  Mrs. White testified she based her in-court identification &quot;on having seen the person in my house with the bicycle and nothing else I am fully satisfied that Reginald Wilson is the person that had the bicycle that night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willie Andrew White testified over objection that he owned the Schwinn 10-speed bicycle to which the bill of indictment refers and that he kept it in the living room of the apartment where he and Mrs. White lived.  He said his wife told him when he arrived home that she recognized one of the burglars as Sister Wilson's boy.  On the night of the burglary he and the officers checked the windows of the apartment and found the kitchen screen had been removed from the kitchen window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Joseph Tripp testified, among other things, that Mrs. White told him when he arrived at the scene on the night in question that one of the intruders &quot;was one of the Wilson&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  boys.&quot; He further testified that he showed Mrs. White six photographs of black males and that she selected Reginald Wilson's picture as the person who was pushing the bicycle through her bedroom on the night of 13 July 1976.  Police Officer Linwood E. White testified to substantially the same thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury convicted defendant of burglary in the first degree and defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment.  He appealed to the Supreme Court assigning errors discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

The court noted that it was not necessary for the state to prove that defendant intended to steal any particular item or property owned by any particular individual. The court also found that the supreme court correctly excluded the contested portion of defendant's jury argument. The court noted that it was incorrect for defendant to instruct the jury to consider the punishment as part of its substantive deliberations.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter came on to be heard before Judge Friday, without a jury.  He found the following facts, to which findings no exception was taken:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff county purchased a tax lien attached to the decedent's property. The county docketed a judgment and issued execution. The court reversed the decision and held that the county improperly sold the decedent's property and therefore conveyed valid title to the purchaser.

Defendant was charged with first-degree murder.  He entered a plea of not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case has previously been before this Court and a new trial was awarded.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">State v. Biggs</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 289 N.C. 522, 223 S.E. 2d 371. Pursuant to a consent order the case was transferred from Chowan County to Gates County for the second trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tended to show that at about 1:30 a.m. on 12 July 1975 Deputy Sheriff Glenn Perry received a phone call from the Edenton Police Department informing him that Doris Jean Ferebee (Doris) had been stabbed.  He proceeded to her home but after a thorough search of the premises was unable to find Doris.  There was a butcher knife and a fire poker on the kitchen table and he observed spots of blood beside the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheriff Troy Toppin came to the Ferebee home and shortly thereafter directed Perry to go to defendant's home to ascertain if defendant could help locate the missing woman.  Deputy Perry, who had earlier that night served a warrant on defendant charging him with assault on Doris Jean Ferebee, proceeded to defendant's home.  Defendant agreed to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  accompany him to the Ferebee home for the purpose of helping them locate Doris.  The circumstances surrounding an inculpatory statement made by defendant to Deputy Sheriff Perry as they returned to the Ferebee home and subsequent statements made by defendant to Sheriff Toppin and SBI Agent William Earl Godley will be more fully set forth in our discussion of the questions presented by this appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 3:00 a.m. SBI Agent Godley found the body of Doris Jean Ferebee on the shoulder of the road about 215 yards from her residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Antoinette Ferebee, the twelve-year-old daughter of the deceased, testified that on the night of 11 July 1975, while sleeping in her mother's bed with her brothers and sisters, she was awakened by a tap on the window.  She heard defendant calling her mother's name.  He then broke open the locked front door and came into the bedroom, carrying an open pocketknife in his hand.  Defendant told the children to get up and go find their mother.  Antoinette went upstairs, where she found her mother hiding under a bed.  After her mother told her to go away, she went back downstairs and told defendant that she was unable to find her mother.  Defendant threatened&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to kill the children if they didn't find their mother for him.  After Doris had received assurances that defendant would not hurt her, she came downstairs armed with a fire poker and a knife.  She and defendant began to argue about the warrant which she had earlier caused to be issued for his arrest.  At that point, in the presence of her children, defendant stabbed Doris.  Defendant then told the children to take one last look at their mother because &quot;[t]he next time you see her she will be in a casket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was expert medical testimony that Doris Jean Ferebee died as a result of four stab wounds in the chest and stomach, any one of which was sufficient to have caused death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty of first-degree murder and the trial judge entered a judgment imposing the death penalty.  </SPAN></P>

When the police responded to the victim's home, they could not find the victim. They proceeded to defendant's home, and defendant accompanied them to the victim's home. En route, he made inculpatory statements. He was tried twice and was convicted after the second trial. On appeal, the court held that the inculpatory statement was properly introduced into evidence because it was given while defendant was not under arrest and while there was no restriction on his freedom. Also, such statement was not the product of interrogation but was spontaneously volunteered by defendant. The court further held that evidence in defendant's prosecution was sufficient, on issues of premeditation and deliberation, to justify submission of the case to the jury on the charge of first-degree murder. Moreover, in view of the United States Supreme Court decision invalidating a statute imposing the death penalty for first-degree murder, defendant's death sentence was to have been vacated and a sentence of life imprisonment was to have been imposed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon an indictment, proper in form, for the murder of Roy Brent Bullock.  Upon the return of a verdict of guilty of first degree murder, defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence introduced by the State tended to show that on the evening of 18 November 1975, Roy Brent Bullock was operating the Food Mart in Butner, North Carolina.  Between 9:00 and 9:30 p.m. on that evening, Bullock's daughter, Lois Marie, age thirteen, was in a &quot;walk-in&quot; cooler placing merchandise on the display racks of the cooler.  The cooler had glass doors which enabled Lois to see her father standing at the counter of the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in the cooler, Lois saw two black males at the counter talking to her father.  She then saw a flash of fire come from a gun which one of the men was carrying and she heard two shots.  The males then ran from the store.  Lois was unable to give a detailed description of the two men.  However, she stated that the man who held the gun and fired the shots was wearing a red and blue or red and black bandanna pulled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  over the bottom half of his face, had short hair, and was taller than the other male.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was stipulated that Bullock died as a result of the gunshot wounds received on this occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Lorenzo Leathers testified that on 6 December 1975, he questioned defendant concerning certain matters unrelated to this case.  After being fully apprised of his constitutional rights, defendant told Leathers that he knew nothing concerning the matters about which he was being questioned.  However, defendant stated that he did know about &quot;some matter that had taken place outside Durham.&quot; He then indicated he knew something about the robbery which had occurred at Butner, and thereupon made a statement to Leathers.  In this statement, defendant admitted that he was paid twenty dollars for acting as the &quot;lookout&quot; during the robbery of a store in Butner.  This robbery was committed by Joe Perry, Albert Willis and one &quot;Boo Boo,&quot; all of whom were armed -- Perry with a .22 automatic pistol, &quot;Boo Boo&quot; with a .41 Magnum pistol and Willis with between a .45 and .25 automatic.  He further stated that Joe Perry had a blue and red handkerchief tied around his neck at the time of the robbery.  The statement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was first reduced to longhand by Leathers and signed by defendant.  Later, the statement was typewritten and also signed by defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified in his own behalf.  He stated that on the evening of 18 November 1975 he was playing cards at the home of his friends, Leroy and Shirlyn Walters.  Defendant further testified that he had been coerced into signing the statements prepared by Leathers and that the statements were the creation of Leathers' imagination.  Defendant also offered the testimony of the Walters who corroborated defendant's statement that he was at their home on the evening of 18 November 1975.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 7A-27(a) by his conviction of the Criminal Session of Granville Superior Court (North Carolina) of first degree murder. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that he was deprived of his liberty without due process arguing that the felony-murder rule relieved the prosecution of the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the crime of first degree murder. Defendant alleged that it relieved the State of proving defendant's actual malice at the time of the crime. The court previously rejected this argument. The felony-murder rule did not place any burden of proof upon defendant. The State was required to prove that a murder was committed in the perpetration of a robbery, and that defendant participated. The statutory definition of murder did not require proof of malice. In his jury charge, the trial judge put the burden of proving every element of the crime upon the State. Defendant contended that there was no evidence that connected him with the robbery and murder. Because defendant did not make a motion for judgment as of nonsuit or for dismissal the court considered this as a challenge to the sufficiency of the State's evidence. The evidence considered in the light most favorable to the State was sufficient to be submitted to the jury. Defendant had a fair trial, free from prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

App. 479, 219 S.E. 2d 660, which reversed summary judgment for defendant entered by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Godwin, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, on 30 December 1974.  This case was docketed and argued as No. 49 at the Spring Term 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, the State of North Carolina on behalf of Dorothea Dix Hospital, brought this action on 6 March 1974, pursuant to G.S. 143-121, to recover from Earl William Davis and his guardian, Leonard Massey, $ 21,005, the cost of maintaining defendant Davis in Dorothea Dix during various periods of confinement from 18 March 1967 to 30 November 1973.  Defendant answered the allegations contained in plaintiff's complaint by denying liability and alleging that the statutes under which plaintiff was proceeding were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both parties moved for summary judgment.  At the hearing on these motions, verified pleadings were introduced which tended to show that during 1966 defendant was charged in Madison County with the murder of his wife.  On 13 January 1967, he was committed to Dorothea Dix for a psychiatric evaluation to determine his competency to stand trial.  This&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  commitment resulted in a finding that he was incompetent to stand trial.  Thereafter, defendant was returned twice to Madison County for trial; however, on both occasions he was returned to Dorothea Dix prior to being tried.  On 7 January 1972, defendant was returned to Madison County and was tried for the murder of his wife.  He was found not guilty by reason of insanity.  Because of evidence at trial tending to establish that defendant suffered from schizophrenia, paranoid type, at the time of the commission of the crime, defendant was committed to Dorothea Dix and remained there at least until 30 November 1973.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After considering the verified pleadings of both parties, the trial judge granted defendant's motion for summary judgment.  This judgment was based upon a finding that the statutes under which plaintiff had proceeded were unconstitutional and therefore void.  From this judgment, plaintiff appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed.  We granted defendant's petition for discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 16 April 1975, Judge Godwin signed an order dismissing the action as to defendant Leonard Massey, guardian of Earl William Davis, and ordering that Davis be permitted to prosecute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this action in his own name.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that N.C. Gen.

The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the patient was required to pay the actual cost of his care, treatment, training, and maintenance while confined to the hospital. The court rejected the patient's contention that he was denied due process of law on the ground that he should have been entitled to an administrative hearing, holding that the patient was given an opportunity to contest the determination of the actual cost of his confinement and an opportunity to contest the finding that he was financially able to pay. The court further held that the patient was given the opportunity to be heard on any and all issues raised by the state's complaint and to have a judicial determination of his liability prior to his being required to pay the amounts alleged to be due. Therefore, the court held that there was a sufficient judicial inquiry into the matter to satisfy due process of law and to obviate the necessity of a hearing before the hospital.</SPAN></P>

This case was docketed and argued as No. 76 at the Fall Term 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon bills of indictment, proper in form, charging her with the (1) kidnapping and (2) armed robbery of Milton L. Royal on 19 November 1975 in Cumberland County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that on 19 November 1975 Raymond Carmichael, John Polson and defendant Joyce Barrow were together in Fayetteville.  Carmichael testified that John Polson asked &quot;how we would like to rob somebody, take the money and the car, . . . and Joyce said it didn't make no difference to her.&quot; They went to Rhudy's Pawn Shop to redeem Polson's pistol, a .32 caliber Smith and Wesson.  After leaving the pawn shop they went to Hay Street in downtown Fayetteville and eventually to a place called The Green Derby.  There Joyce Barrow found Michelle Johnson and Michelle was told about the robbery plans.  They returned to Hay Street where Polson told Joyce Barrow and Michelle Johnson &quot;to get somebody and bring them back to Bass Street and said that we'd take it from there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two girls, using Polson's pistol, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  attempted to rob a woman selling Avon products but failed.  All four conspirators then went to Bass Street and stayed together until Milton L. Royal drove into the nearby parking lot.  Then, acting according to plan, Joyce Barrow and Michelle Johnson approached Royal and asked for cigarettes.  After giving each of them a cigarette, he turned to walk away and was confronted by Raymond Carmichael and John Polson who, with gun in hand, demanded his watch, ring and billfold.  As Royal reached for his billfold Polson grabbed the gun from Carmichael and shot Royal in the left side.  Polson then took Royal's watch, keys to the car and billfold.  As ordered by Polson, Royal opened the trunk of the car, got in, and Carmichael slammed the lid.  The four robbers then drove Royal's car to Smith Lake at Fort Bragg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trunk was opened at Smith Lake and Royal was ordered out.  Royal ran but Polson caught him in the woods and brought him back to a latrine building where Carmichael struck him in the side with his first.  Royal ran again, tripped and fell, and Polson shot him in the stomach.  While Mr. Royal lay on the ground, Polson shot him again.  The two men then took him into the latrine building, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  removed his clothing and put him in a latrine.  Polson then struck Royal with a lug wrench and thereafter shot him for the fourth time.  He then fired twice into the latrine and called for &quot;Joyce&quot; to bring him some more bullets.  The Johnson girl brought them and went back to the car.  Polson began firing again and eventually left the latrine building.  He fastened the door with the lug wrench and apparently thought Royal was dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men returned to the car and, with Michelle Johnson and Raymond Carmichael in the back seat and Joyce Barrow and John Polson in the front, left Smith Lake and drove to New Jersey in the victim's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About ten o'clock the next morning the four robbers were apprehended by the New Jersey State Police.  A search of their personal belongings revealed in defendant's possession (1) a cartridge holder with twenty-four empty and six live rounds for a .32 caliber weapon, (2) Milton Royal's bank credit card, library card, checkbook, receipts, Veteran's Administration card, motor vehicle inspection card, Ford Motor Company payment book and a bank deposit receipt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All four of the robbers were returned to North Carolina for trial.  John Polson and Raymond Carmichael&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pled guilty to armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill.  Michelle Johnson pled guilty to armed robbery.  Defendant Joyce Barrow pled not guilty and testified as a witness in her own behalf.  Her testimony tends to show that she was sixteen years old; that she and Michelle Johnson approached Mr. Royal for a cigarette and saw the gun for the first time when Raymond Carmichael drew it on Royal; that she knew nothing of any planned robbery and thought Polson was joking when he laughingly asked her and the others about robbing someone; and that she was ordered into the car by Polson and went under coercion.  She further testified that she received nothing from the robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Joyce Barrow was convicted of aggravated kidnapping and armed robbery.  Judge Bailey imposed a life sentence for each offense, to run concurrently.  Defendant appealed assigning errors discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Criminal Session, Cumberland Superior Court (North Carolina) convicting her of aggravated kidnapping and armed robbery and imposing a life sentence for each offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence showed that defendant participated in a robbery and kidnapping of a victim with three codefendants. Defendant testified that she was sixteen years old at the time of the offense and that she knew nothing about the planned robbery and thought the codefendants were joking when discussing kidnapping. On appeal, the court held that, while it appeared that defendant did not play a dominant role in the commission of the crime, the fact that another was the dominant actor was immaterial on the question of defendant's guilt. Thus, the denial of defendant's motion for nonsuit was proper because the evidence implicated defendant as a willing participant in the planning and execution of the crimes. Second, the court held that the trial court did not err in not instructing the jury on lesser included offenses because defendant's evidence tended to show complete innocence, not evidence of a lesser included offense. Finally, the court held that defendant was not entitled to a lesser sentence on the ground that her codefendants received lighter sentences as no rule of law established that sentences imposed upon defendants for a crime jointly committed by them had to be equal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant pursuant to G.S. 7A-27(a) from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Martin, Harry C., J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 12 July 1976 Session of Haywood Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On an indictment, proper in form, defendant was charged with the first-degree murder of Leo Jack Clark.  The jury found defendant guilty as charged and a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second appeal in this case.  We granted defendant a new trial in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">State v. Warren</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 289 N.C. 551, 223 S.E. 2d 317 (1976).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered evidence tending to show the following: Leo Jack Clark was a resident of a rest home in Waynesville, North Carolina.  On 4 February 1975, Clark ate lunch at the rest home and then left for town with about $ 18.00 in his possession.  When he failed to return for the evening meal, normally served between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m., Mary L. Caldwell, the operator of the rest home, notified the police.  Clark's body was found on 5 February 1975 inside the abandoned Pure Oil bulk plant near the railroad tracks in Waynesville.  The floor of the building was littered with debris, papers, and dirt, and there was blood on the littered paper and the wall.  The victim's wallet, found lying beside his body, was empty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Robert S. Boatwright, an expert in pathology, examined the body and found numerous injuries upon the face of the deceased, including a deep abrasion on the upper left forehead, a torn left ear with exposed cartilage, a one-inch wound over the left eyebrow and a long abrasion over the left jaw which extended into the mouth, and a broken jawbone.  There was internal hemorrhaging beneath the skull, multiple rib fractures, punctured lungs, ruptured liver, broken right wrist, broken left hand and leg.  The doctor gave his opinion that the cause of death was multiple injuries.  More specifically, he felt that either injuries to the side of the head and the brain, fractured ribs, ruptured liver or the shock from the combined trauma were all sufficient to cause death.  He further stated that in his opinion the wounds about the head and face were caused by a blunt instrument, rather than a sharp instrument.  He found no wounds that he could characterize as stab wounds, either on the face or the thoracic area of the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further evidence for the State tended to show that the deceased had been seen by Kathy Trammell, an employee of the rest home, between 4:00 and 4:30 p.m. on 4 February approximately&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  200 to 300 yards from the bulk plant, walking in the direction of the rest home.  Barbara Mercer saw the defendant talking to Reeves Webb on the street the same afternoon.  Later, defendant, his brother, and Reeves Webb came to Barbara Mercer's house and drank some wine.  Verlin Stewart saw defendant in the area of the bulk plant with an unidentified person between 4:00 and 4:30 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reeves Webb testified that he met defendant, defendant's brother and the deceased near the railroad tracks on the afternoon of 4 February.  Reeves left to get more wine from the A &amp; P Store nearby.  When Webb returned with the wine, he met defendant and his brother on the street near the Mercer house, but Clark was not with them.  The three went into the Mercer house and drank some wine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verner Frank London, who was not a witness at the first trial, testified that on the morning of 5 February 1975, he was in a beer joint in Waynesville and recalled the defendant coming in and sitting beside him.  Defendant was intoxicated and said &quot;he had killed a man down about the railroad tracks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronald R. Shattles, who also was not a witness at the first trial, testified that on 25 February 1975, he was in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Haywood County Jail charged with several counts of forgery.  He occupied a cell in common with the defendant and others, including Curtis Wyatt.  The subject of Jack Clark's death came up and someone asked the defendant &quot;if he had done it.&quot; Defendant said in Shattles' presence that he and his brother had been drinking in a shed together with Reeves Webb and the deceased; that they sent Reeves Webb for more wine; that after he left, defendant and his brother decided to rob the deceased; that in the course of the robbery defendant's brother beat Clark with a two by four and that he, defendant, stabbed the deceased twice; that &quot;it sounded like air coming out of a car tire&quot;; that they took $ 18.34 from the deceased and wiped their hands on papers in the shed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curtis Boyd Wyatt was incarcerated in the Haywood County Jail on 25 February on a breaking and entering charge.  While in jail, he was placed in a cell with the defendant, Shattles, and others.  Defendant told Wyatt that he and his brother met Webb and &quot;this old man&quot; on a railroad track and drank wine with them until the wine ran out.  They sent Reeves to get some more wine with a dollar that the old man gave them.  While Reeves&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was gone, defendant and his brother decided to rob the old man.  When he put up a scuffle, defendant's brother struck the deceased with a two by four and defendant stabbed him with a knife.  Defendant said they got $ 18.34 or $ 18.36 from him.  After that the defendant cleaned himself off with papers and went out to the street to meet Reeves before he returned with the wine.  They met Reeves across from the Mercer house and went inside to drink the wine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>

Docketed and argued in this Court as Case No. 160 at the Fall Term 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants were charged in separate bills of indictment, proper in form, with the armed robbery of H. Lewis Braswell on 16 February 1976 in Richmond County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">H. Lewis Braswell testified that he and his wife operated a combination grocery-fabric store about three miles north of Ellerbe on U.S. Highway 220 in Richmond County.  On 16 February 1976 two black men, later identified as defendants, drove up in a green Plymouth and entered the Braswell store about thirty seconds apart.  Defendant Legette went into the cloth room, followed by Wilson.  When Mr. Braswell went back to the cash register in the grocery store, Wilson followed him and asked for some men's socks.  While the socks were being shown, Wilson stuck a .38 caliber revolver in Mr. Braswell's side and told him to be quiet.  Mr. Braswell requested the robbers not to hurt him or his wife and stated they could have all the money.  The sum of $ 128.70 was taken from the cash register in the cloth shop and $ 156.18 was taken from the cash register&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the grocery store.  Defendants also took a money bag containing $ 1,060.  Mr. Braswell and his wife were then tied together, blindfolded and ordered to lie on the floor, which they did.  The robbers left and within three to five minutes Mr. Braswell heard a familiar voice at the door, jumped up and saw defendant Wilson outside the window in the back yard.  The green Plymouth was just pulling out slowly in front of the driveway.  Mr. Braswell grabbed his shotgun from the storeroom, ran out the front door, fired one shot at the fleeing car and another at defendant Wilson who had just gone over the fence surrounding the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money bag containing $ 1,060 was later found across the road approximately 130 yards from the store.  The robbery was reported to the sheriff by telephone.  Shortly thereafter a truck driver stopped at the store and gave Mr. Braswell the license number of the green Plymouth involved in the robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truck driver, Eugene Allen Sparkman, testified that he saw a black male running down the road and a white man running after him with a shotgun.  The black male ran to and entered an automobile bearing a blue and yellow Pennsylvania license plate, number&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3X0979.  Mr. Sparkman turned his truck around and drove to Mr. Braswell's store to give him that information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nathan Grant, a deputy sheriff of Richmond County, was on duty at the time of the robbery.  He observed a 1968 black-over-green Plymouth bearing Pennsylvania license number 3X0979 and pulled in behind it.  Another deputy pulled his car in front of the Plymouth and the two officers stopped the fleeing vehicle.  Defendants were taken out of the Plymouth, placed under arrest and searched.  Defendant Legette had $ 67.00 in his pockets and $ 60.00 in his billfold.  Inside the Plymouth in plain view, scattered about the floorboard and seat of the car, was $ 16.82 in loose change.  The officers seized 27 quarters, 43 dimes, 77 nickels and 192 pennies, most of which was visible from the outside of the car.  The butt end of a revolver handle was sticking out of a paper bag on the floorboard on the passenger side of the car.  This gun was seized by the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key, later determined to open a lock on the icebox in Mr. Braswell's store, was found in the console of the green Plymouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Braswell testified that the robbery occurred in the afternoon; that the fluorescent lighting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the store was on; that he was able to see the face of each robber clearly, and that the two robbers were in the store and observed by him for five to seven minutes.  Mr. Braswell testified there was no doubt in his mind that the two defendants are the men who robbed him.  He based his identification &quot;on how they appeared at the time they committed the robbery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harold Legette, alias Kenny Brown, testified that he was born in Richmond County but lived in Pennsylvania.  On the date he was arrested he was in Richmond County to visit his mother and to attend a relative's funeral.  Defendant Wilson and wife accompanied him.  On the day of his arrest he and defendant Wilson, after unsuccessfully attempting to find his sister for a brief visit, left Wadesboro intending to proceed to U.S. 1 north and return to Pennsylvania.  They came to an intersection where the road was blocked by many police officers.  There they were stopped, searched and arrested.  Defendant Legette said he had never seen Mr. Braswell at that time and had never been in his grocery store located north of Ellerbe on Highway 220.  He asked the officers what his arrest was all about but received no reply.  He did not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  see any pistol at the scene.  He stated that he had seen defendant Wilson at his home in Pennsylvania with a key similar to the one offered in evidence and if that key fit Mr. Braswell's icebox it was merely a coincidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination Legette testified that the license and registration for his car was issued in the name of Kenny Brown; that under that name he had been convicted of robbery, robbery by assault and purse snatching, and pled guilty to robbery and burglary in 1968.  He stated that &quot;there was a gun like that in my car&quot; but I didn't go anywhere with it.  He said they put defendant Wilson's wife on a bus and sent her back to Pennsylvania and admitted that he had recently been released from prison but didn't know whether he was on parole or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Forrest Lee Wilson, alias James Lee Wilson, testified that he was twenty-six years of age and lived in Bristol, Pennsylvania.  He accompanied defendant Legette to North Carolina.  On the day of his arrest they were getting ready to return to Pennsylvania and went to Wadesboro to visit Legette's sister before leaving.  They failed to find her and were driving toward U.S. 1 to go north when the officers stopped them. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This defendant said there was some change in the console of the green Plymouth to be used for paying tolls on their return trip.  He denied having ever owned a pistol and stated that the first time he saw the pistol allegedly taken from their car was at the police station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination this defendant said his correct name was Forrest James Wilson and that he had known Legette about eight years.  He admitted that he had been tried and convicted for a number of crimes including &quot;no more than two robberies.&quot; He said he pled guilty to burglary and resisting arrest in 1969 and to larceny and receiving stolen goods in 1969.  He admitted that he had served time for a parole violation on worthless checks and forgery and was presently on parole in the State of Pennsylvania.  He denied robbing Mr. and Mrs. Braswell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury convicted each defendant of armed robbery, and each was sentenced to a term of not less than forty years nor more than life, less credit for time spent in jail awaiting trial.  Defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals, and we ordered the case transferred to the Supreme Court for initial appellate review.  Errors assigned will be discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

The court found defendants were not denied due process and confrontation rights with respect to the in-court identification by the refusal of the lower court to allow them to examine the photographs because failure to do so did not amount to an abuse of discretion. The court found it was not error by the lower court to refuse to suppress items of evidence seized from defendants' car at the time of their arrest because there was probable cause to arrest defendants and to search the car because defendants had been adequately described to the police and they had reason to believe that the robbers would still be in possession of the gun and stolen money.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On indictments, proper in form, defendant was charged with two counts of first degree burglary and two counts of assault on a law enforcement officer with a firearm.  He was found not guilty of one count of first degree burglary and guilty as charged as to the remainder.  The court imposed the mandatory life sentence for the first degree burglary conviction, a five year sentence to run concurrently with the burglary sentence for one assault conviction and a sentence of five years for the second assault conviction to commence at the expiration of the first assault sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Alberta Wood, a resident of a subdivision in Mecklenburg County known as Moore's Park, went to bed about 11:45 p.m. on 6 January 1976 after checking her front and back doors to be sure they were locked. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sometime after midnight, she heard her Irish Setter dog barking.  The barking aroused her suspicion because the dog had cancer of the throat and had not barked for a few months.  Mrs. Wood found the dog standing in the living room facing the dining room.  The dining room window, which had been closed and locked, was wide open.  Mrs. Wood slammed it down and locked it.  She went through the kitchen and den but found nothing unusual.  She called her daughter next door who sent over her boyfriend to assist.  Upon further investigation, Mrs. Wood discovered that the back door was unlocked, that some other windows were unlatched, and that a trash can had been moved in the kitchen.  The police were called.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Shaw of the Mecklenburg County Police Department received a radio dispatch to proceed to the Wood home on Teresa Avenue.  At the time of the call, he was parked several blocks away in a vacant Phillips 66 Service Station lot at the corner of Little Rock Road and Wilkinson Boulevard.  As he was leaving that location, he noticed a green Dodge automobile parked on the other side of the Phillips 66 building.  This automobile matched the description of a stolen vehicle for which Officer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shaw had been searching several days.  He informed police headquarters and requested the dispatcher to send another car out to identify the suspect vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Shaw drove to the Wood home and remained there until other officers arrived.  He then returned to the Phillips Station where Officer Patton by that time had the green Dodge under surveillance.  Officer Shaw stationed himself at a nearby lot where he was soon joined by Officer Bailey.  Both of these officers were in uniform and driving marked, bright yellow county police department vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 2 a.m. Officer Patton advised Officer Shaw that a subject, coming from behind the Phillips Station, was entering the green Dodge.  A few seconds later the suspect vehicle backed up and drove out of the Phillips Station lot with its headlights off.  When it reached Little Rock Road the lights came on.  Officers Shaw and Bailey gave pursuit.  The green Dodge accelerated and turned into the Cloud Nine Lounge parking lot.  Officer Bailey followed the suspect car around the building.  Officer Shaw drove around the other side of the building to block the vehicle.  The green Dodge became wedged between the police cars and collided with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  both of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the suspect car stopped moving, the driver jumped out from the passenger side and started running.  Officer Shaw jumped from his car and ordered the suspect to halt.  When he failed to do so, Officer Shaw fired at him but the driver of the Dodge continued to run.  Officer Bailey pursued the suspect.  The driver reached in his waistband, pulled out a gun and fired.  Officer Bailey returned the fire.  The driver ran across the street and disappeared into a used car lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the suspect fired his pistol, Officers Bailey and Shaw were about 20 to 25 feet apart.  They observed the weapon pointed in their general direction, saw flashes, and heard three to four shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the suspect disappeared, the officers radioed for assistance.  When other units arrived they sealed off the neighborhood.  Mr. Overcash arrived with a trained bloodhound by the name of Snoopy.  The dog was taken to the area where the suspect was last seen.  Snoopy picked up a scent and led the men to a fence bordering the used car lot.  The dog appeared to want to go inside the fence.  The used car lot was ordered surrounded.  The officers heard the sound of metal against metal.  A search was made&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the vacant trucks in the used car lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 4:14 a.m. the driver of the green Dodge was found in the cab of a dump truck.  He had been wounded and was bleeding.  The driver, identified as the defendant, was taken into custody and relieved of a .38 caliber pistol.  The gun contained four spent shells and one live round.  A search of the defendant produced $ 100 in paper money (three $ 20's, two $ 10's, two $ 5's, and ten $ 1's).  Defendant was taken to the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the request of Officer Shaw, Mr. Overcash, the bloodhound handler, took the dog to the Wood house to see if he could pick up a scent.  The bloodhound picked up a track under the dining room window and followed it through the Wood's backyard to another backyard a block away.  The dog appeared confused at that point so his handler took him around the house.  There he regained the scent and led his handler several more blocks, finally stopping at the Phillips 66 Service Station where the green Dodge had first been observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meanwhile, another strange occurrence had been discovered at the Hipp residence, in Moore's Park, a few blocks from the Wood residence.  About 3 a.m. Mrs. Hipp awoke and went to the bathroom. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There she noticed a pair of pants on the floor.  Thinking that they were her daughter's bluejeans, she paid no attention to them and returned to bed.  When she got up at 6 a.m. and saw her husband's wallet lying on a pile of laundry in the bathroom, she realized that the pants she had observed earlier were those of her husband.  The night before he had placed them on a chair in the bedroom.  The wallet had been in the pants pocket and had contained $ 60 when they went to bed.  The wallet was empty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking further around the bathroom, Mrs. Hipp spotted her change purse lying on a hamper.  It was also empty.  The night before the purse had been in the pocket of her car coat which had been hanging in the bathroom.  Mrs. Hipp remembered having about $ 45 in the purse before she went out to dinner the previous evening.  She recalled that she had spent some of the $ 45 on her dinner.  She reported to the police that approximately $ 100 had been taken from her and her husband consisting of three $ 20's, two $ 10's, two $ 5's and some $ 1's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While waiting for the police to arrive, she went downstairs and found two outside doors open.  Both doors had been locked the night before.  She discovered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a piece of pasteboard, which had covered a broken window in the basement, lying on the ground outside and a box of kleenex, which had been on the window sill, lying on the floor inside.  Later in the morning as she was looking through the house again, she found a dirty dish towel which she had never seen before.  In the meantime, a few blocks away, Mrs. Wood had discovered that a dish towel, which belonged to a set of matched towels, was missing from her kitchen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the police arrived at the Hipp home about 6:30 a.m., they searched the house and dusted for fingerprints around the window sill.  One identifiable print was removed.  This latent print matched a fingerprint of defendant's right little finger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Wood reported to the police that her dish towel, which had been hanging on a rack beside the kitchen door, was missing.  Mrs. Wood had fed her cat before retiring and remembered wiping her hands on the towel.  An officer arrived at her home bringing the dish towel discovered at Mrs. Hipp's house.  This towel matched the rest of Mrs. Wood's set, smelled of cat food, and appeared to be Mrs. Wood's missing towel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant's evidence tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dennis of the Mecklenburg County Police Department, who investigated the incident at the Wood home, reported that no fingerprints were found on the window sill where the window had been opened, that the window sill was still covered with dust, and that no pry or force marks were found on the window inside or outside.  His report indicated that he &quot;[c]ould not believe any entry was gained&quot; and labeled the crime being investigated an &quot;attempted first degree burglary.&quot; Officer Dennis admitted on cross-examination that Mrs. Wood told him some facts that would have indicated an entry but which he failed to include in his report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Mathis of the Mecklenburg County Police Department testified that he conducted the investigation at the Hipp house.  According to his report, the Hipps reported missing $ 100 and Mr. Hipp's plaid sport coat.  This coat was never found.  The officer's report did not mention the dirty dish towel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have found it difficult to ascertain the facts from the 26 pages of the brief submitted by appellant for this purpose.  Rule 28(b)(2) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure provides, among other things, that the appellant's brief &quot;. . . should additionally contain&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">short</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, non-argumentative </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">summary</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the essential facts underlying the matter in controversy where this will be helpful to an understanding of the questions presented for review.&quot; (Emphasis added.) Fortunately, the State's brief presented a clear and concise statement of the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other facts necessary to the decision will be discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In 76CR2984 (burglary) -- New trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a decision by the Mecklenburg Superior Court (North Carolina), which consolidated his charges and convicted him of assault on a law enforcement officer with a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to trial, the State moved to consolidate the four charges against defendant for trial. The State's motion was granted. Defendant objected and moved to sever the cases, and that motion was denied. Defendant properly renewed his motion for a severance during the trial as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-927(a)(2). In his first assignment of error defendant contested both the consolidation of the cases and the denial of his motion for a severance. The court found that there was no showing made that a severance was necessary in this case to insure a fair determination by the jury on each charge. The evidence presented was not unusually complicated or confusing. The lower court judge clearly and carefully separated the offenses in his instructions. Thus, the court held that the reversible error of the lower court judge was failing to permit defense counsel to state the mandatory punishment for first degree burglary in his final jury argument. Had this been permitted, no prejudicial error could have resulted from the court's refusal to instruct the jury on the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that defendant was entitled to a new trial on the first degree burglary charge and found no error in the two assault convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendants appeal from judgments of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Thornburg, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 10 May 1976 Session, Mecklenburg Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first trial of these defendants on 30 September 1974 resulted in a mistrial.  At their second trial, commencing 11 November 1975, defendants were convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death.  They appealed and were awarded a new trial.  See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">State v. Smith</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 289 N.C. 143, 221 S.E. 2d 247 (1976).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 10 May 1976 defendants were again placed on trial.  In Case No. 74-CR-1598, defendant David Benjamin Smith, alias David Benjamin McCullough, is charged with the murder of Arthur William Hawkins, and in Case No. 74-CR-1599, said defendant is charged with the murder of Norman Bruce Wagstaff.  In Case No. 74-CR-1600, defendant Bobby Orlando Foster is charged with the murder of Norman Bruce Wagstaff, and in Case No. 74-CR-1601, this defendant is charged with the murder of Arthur William Hawkins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All four bills of indictment allege that the murders occurred in Mecklenburg County on 11 August 1973.  The four cases were consolidated for trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that on 15 September 1965 Arthur William Hawkins purchased a .32 caliber Burgo, Model 108 pistol, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  serial number 112195, from Fox Jewelry and Loan in Jacksonville, Florida.  He was employed as a security guard by the Days Inn Motel on Tuckaseegee Road in Charlotte, North Carolina, for about a year prior to his death on 11 August 1973.  Norman Bruce Wagstaff was employed at the Days Inn Motel on Tuckaseegee Road as a manager-trainee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday evening, 10 August 1973, and into the early morning hours of Saturday, 11 August 1973, Arthur William Hawkins and Norman Bruce Wagstaff were on duty and Hawkins had his .32 caliber Burgo pistol in his possession.  There was $ 200 in cash in the cash register.  These two employees were alone when last seen around 1 a.m. on the morning of 11 August 1973.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this same evening, Belinda Harris went to a night spot called the &quot;Right On Lounge&quot; or &quot;Howard's Grill&quot; with her sister and another female companion.  Around 12:30 a.m. on the morning of 11 August 1973, she met defendants Smith and Foster in the parking lot at this night spot.  She and her sister accompanied defendants in a black 98 Oldsmobile driven by Foster to another establishment known as &quot;Bill's.&quot; Belinda's sister left the party at that point, and Belinda and the two defendants rode&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  around awhile.  Smith left the car and Belinda and Foster &quot;drove on a short time&quot; and then met Smith, who was driving a &quot;rather raggely car.&quot; Foster and Belinda got into this car with Smith and they went to the Days Inn Motel on Tuckaseegee Road in the &quot;raggely car,&quot; ostensibly to pick up a girl.  Smith and Foster left Belinda Harris in the car while they entered the motel.  While they were gone she heard two or more sounds &quot;like either a blowout or a car backfire.&quot; They returned to the &quot;raggely car&quot; shortly thereafter and left the premises.  They drove to some point on a major highway with a grass median where all three of them left the &quot;raggely car,&quot; walked across the grass median and entered the black 98 Oldsmobile parked there, headed in the opposite direction.  They drove to the home of Belinda Harris' mother, picked up Belinda's brother Henry Harris (also known as Henry Peterson), went to an eating establishment and returned around 5 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 2:45 a.m. on the morning of 11 August 1973, the bodies of Hawkins and Wagstaff were discovered on the floor behind the counter in the office of the Days Inn Motel on Tuckaseegee Road.  Hawkins was dead and Wagstaff died shortly thereafter. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Each had been shot several times.  Hawkins had no wallet and his .32 caliber Burgo was missing from his holster.  The office had been ransacked, chairs turned over, drawers pulled out, papers scattered, a telephone off the hook, the telephone switchboard torn out of the wall, all of the cash missing, and spatters of blood at various places.  Three bullets were recovered from the victims: a .32 caliber bullet from Hawkins' body, a .25 caliber bullet from Wagstaff's head and a .32 caliber bullet from Wagstaff's abdomen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday night and in the early morning hours of Monday, 13 August 1973, Delton Harris met defendants at a party in Charlotte.  Foster had a .38 caliber pistol in his belt during the party and left with this pistol in his possession.  Defendants said they were leaving town and going to New York City.  Delton Harris asked to ride with them.  They went to the apartment of Belinda Harris in Foster's black 98 Oldsmobile.  There, while the car was being packed, Delton Harris saw defendant Smith put a .32 caliber 7-shot revolver in a compartment in the rear of the car.  Then the two defendants, accompanied by Delton Harris, one Barry Montgomery, Belinda Harris and her two&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  children, left for New York City in Foster's car and arrived there on Monday evening, 13 August 1973.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 30 August 1973, Trooper Douglas D. Sinopouli of the New Jersey State Police stopped Foster's car on the New Jersey Turnpike.  Defendant Smith was also present in the car.  The officer observed a gun partially hidden in the front seat.  The weapon was seized and defendants were taken into custody.  This weapon was identified as the .32 caliber Burgo, 7-shot revolver, serial 112195, model 108, belonging to Hawkins.  It was later determined by ballistics tests that the .32 caliber bullet recovered from the abdomen of Wagstaff was fired from this pistol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant David Benjamin Smith, alias McCullough, testified as a witness in his own behalf.  He said Belinda Harris was his girl friend; that he saw her and Bobby Foster and others at the &quot;Right On&quot; night spot around midnight on the night of 10 August 1973, went to &quot;Bill's&quot; in Foster's car, took Belinda home and picked up Henry Harris and then went to Uncle John's Pancake House, arriving there about 1 a.m. on 11 August 1973.  While they sat and waited to be served, Henry Harris left and he saw Henry no more that night.  He and Foster&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  remained at the pancake house about two and a half hours, then took Belinda home where he spent the remainder of the night with her.  Smith denied any participation in the crime and testified that he obtained the .32 caliber Burgo pistol from Henry Harris (Peterson) the night they were packing the car to go to New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Smith offered Henry Harris, also known as Henry Peterson, who testified that he was serving a term for armed robbery in South Carolina.  In August 1973 he lived with his mother and his sister Belinda Harris in a house on McDowell Street in Charlotte.  After being assured by the presiding judge that the State, having once placed him on trial with defendants Smith and Foster for the murders of Hawkins and Wagstaff and having failed to make a case, could not again try him upon the same charges, Henry Harris testified that after he left Smith and Foster and his sister Belinda at the pancake house on the night of 11 August 1973, he and another man went to the Days Inn Motel on Tuckaseegee Road and killed Hawkins and Wagstaff while robbing the place.  He refused to divulge the name of the other man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Foster offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury convicted defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Smith of first degree murder of Norman Bruce Wagstaff in Case No. 74-CR-1599 and first degree murder of Arthur William Hawkins in Case No. 74-CR-1598.  Smith was sentenced to death in each case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury convicted defendant Foster of first degree murder of Norman Bruce Wagstaff in Case No. 74-CR-1600 and first degree murder of Arthur William Hawkins in Case No. 74-CR-1601.  He was sentenced to death in each case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From judgments pronounced, each defendant appealed to the Supreme Court, assigning errors discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a consolidated trial, defendant and co-defendant appealed the judgments of the Mecklenburg Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted each of them, upon jury verdicts, of first degree murder of two separate victims, and sentenced each of them to death in each case, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17 (Cum. Supp. 1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and co-defendant were indicted for first degree murder for killing two hotel employees. At the end of a consolidated trial, they were convicted by a jury and were sentenced to death under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17 (Cum. Supp. 1975). On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions for several reasons, including: (1) the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the offense of first degree murder was committed; (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to strike the testimony of a witness who had refreshed her memory by looking at a transcript of her testimony at a previous trial; (3) the consolidation of the cases for trial was proper since neither defendant nor co-defendant was deprived of a fair trial; and (4) the examination of the state's reasons for the exercise of its peremptory challenges was not allowed. The court vacated the death sentences because the United States Supreme Court had subsequently invalidated the death penalty provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17 (Cum. Supp. 1975). Sentences of life imprisonment were therefore substituted in lieu of the death penalty by authority of the provisions of 1973 N.C. Sess. Laws 1201, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgments convicting defendant and co-defendant of first degree murder were affirmed. The judgments sentencing defendant and co-defendant to death were vacated. The case was remanded to the trial court with directions: (1) that the presiding judge enter judgments imposing life imprisonment in lieu of the death penalty; and (2) that the clerk of the trial court issue commitments in substitution for the commitments previously issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court allowed a written report of a laboratory analysis that concluded that certain material found in defendant's possession was marijuana into evidence against him pursuant to N.C.

Defendant, a juvenile, was found to have violated the Controlled Substances Act and was adjudged to be a delinquent child. The appellate court affirmed the adjudication against defendant. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the appellate court and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. The court concluded that it was error for the district court to have admitted the report into evidence against defendant. The court held that &sect; 90-95(g) was not intended to apply to proceedings that resulted in adjudications of delinquency in the district court. Application of &sect; 90-95(g) would have effectively deprived defendant of the opportunity to confront or cross-examine the chemist who performed the analysis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On petition for discretionary review of the decision of the Court of Appeals, reported in 30 N.C. App. 261, 226 S.E. 2d 869, which affirmed judgment for plaintiff entered by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Bailey, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 9 October 1975 Civil Session of Wake Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff is a North Carolina corporation whose principal activity is the construction and sale of residential dwellings to individuals in Cumberland County.  To effectuate a sale, plaintiff usually received a small down payment from the purchaser.  The purchaser then assumed a first mortgage on the property, which was held by a third party lender, and gave plaintiff a second mortgage upon the property.  Plaintiff remained liable on the first mortgage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to section 453 of the Internal Revenue Code, plaintiff elected to report the income received from these sales under the &quot;installment method.&quot; Under this method, plaintiff reported taxable gain, and accordingly paid income tax thereon, on the installments in the year in which the payments were actually received.  The money to be received in the future as installment payments was carried on plaintiff's books as &quot;Deferred Sales -- Installment Basis.&quot; For the year ending 31 October&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1964, plaintiff had $ 142,650.87 in the deferred sales account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In computing the amount owed as franchise tax for 1965 (this covered the year ending 31 October 1964), plaintiff did not include the $ 142,650.87 of deferred sales.  The Secretary of Revenue audited plaintiff and assessed an additional franchise tax of $ 213.98, plus $ 6.42 interest, based upon an inclusion of the deferred sales account in the computation of plaintiff's franchise tax base.  Plaintiff sued for a partial refund.  In its complaint, plaintiff alleged that if the amount carried as deferred sales was to be included in the computation of the franchise tax, a deduction for future state and federal income taxes arising from those sales should be allowed as a deduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial on the merits, before Judge Bailey, without a jury, both parties introduced evidence.  At the close of the evidence, defendant moved for nonsuit.  This was overruled, and plaintiff's claim for a partial refund was allowed, based upon Judge Bailey's conclusion that a deduction from deferred sales for state and federal income taxes to become due in the future was proper.  The Court of Appeals affirmed and we granted defendant's petition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for discretionary review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant secretary of revenue brought a petition for discretionary review of the decision of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed judgment for plaintiff taxpayer and allowed a claim for a partial refund. The appeals court had overruled the secretary of revenue's motion for nonsuit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer argued that it should be permitted to deduct from its franchise tax base, as computed under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-122(b), the amount of state and federal income taxes, which may become due as certain installment income is received in the future. The court held that the secretary of revenue, in making his determination of the taxpayer's franchise tax liability, was bound to follow the directive of the franchise tax statute. The court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-122(b) did not permit a deduction for future income taxes from the franchise tax base and did not require that the Commissioner use generally accepted accounting principles in making his determination of the franchise tax. The court held that the application of the franchise tax as applied to the taxpayer did not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the North Carolina Constitution. The court held that the taxpayer having voluntarily elected the installment method of accounting for income tax purposes, could not deduct from its franchise tax base an anticipated future state and federal income tax liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision of the appeals court, which affirmed judgment for the taxpayer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c1"><SPAN CLASS="c4">December 21, 1976, Filed </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant appeals pursuant to G.S. 7A-27(a) from judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Herring, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered at the 19 January 1976 Criminal Session, Cumberland County Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On indictments, proper in form, defendant was charged and found guilty of two counts of first degree murder and one of armed robbery.  The death sentence was imposed for the murder convictions and, as was proper, judgment was arrested for the armed robbery conviction because the murder indictments were tried on the theory of felony murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deceased Larry Lovett left for work around 6 a.m. on 7 August 1975.  He was employed by McArthur Road Seven-Eleven Store in Fayetteville and was familiar with the fact that $ 125.00 was always placed in the floor safe when the store closed at night.  He had been instructed not to resist a robbery and did not own or carry a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before 7 a.m. on the same morning, deceased Norma Ehrhart left her home to pick up a few groceries at the Seven-Eleven Store.  About the same hour, Clarence Hilliard and Janice Whitten left for work together and planned to stop at the same store to pick up some cigarettes.  They pulled up outside&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the store at 7:10 a.m. Both of them noticed a yellow Maverick automobile parked alongside their car, and shortly thereafter saw a light-complexioned black man come out of the store and head for the Maverick.  Janice Whitten and Clarence Hilliard later identified the defendant as this man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clarence Hilliard waited in the car while Janice Whitten got out and headed for the double-door entrance-way.  As she reached the doors, she observed a dark-complexioned black man come out of the store and get in the passenger side of the Maverick.  Janice Whitten later identified this man as the codefendant, Bobby Bowden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Janice Whitten walked into the store and noticed no clerks in sight and that it was very quiet.  She waited awhile and another customer came in.  While she was talking to the other customer, they heard muffled, moaning sounds coming from the back storage room.  They went to the storage room door and opened it.  There Janice Whitten saw Larry Lovett, lying on his left side, bleeding from his head and stomach.  Close by lay Norma Ehrhart, also bleeding.  Both had been shot and were breathing faintly.  Janice Whitten ran to the front of the store to call the police and summon Clarence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hilliard.  When she came back to the storeroom, she bent over Larry Lovett to inquire about his condition.  He responded that he was hurt in &quot;My head and my gut . . . it just happened.  Didn't you see them?&quot; By this time Clarence Hilliard was in the storeroom asking Larry Lovett what happened.  Larry replied, &quot;It just happened.  Didn't you see them two black dudes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon thereafter, officers from the Sheriff's department arrived.  Norma Ehrhart appeared to be dead and Larry Lovett was still struggling.  Ambulances took them to the hospital where both were pronounced dead on arrival.  It was determined that $ 124.89 had been taken from the floor safe.  Janice Whitten and Clarence Hilliard told the officers what they had seen in the store but did not mention the two black males they had seen leaving in the yellow Maverick.  Later the same day when they heard of the death of Larry Lovett, they went to the Law Enforcement Center and reported that they had seen two black men leaving the scene.  Four days later, they returned to the Center and each identified the defendant separately from photographs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, 12 August 1975, a lineup was held in which the defendant was one of six&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  persons shown to Janice Whitten and Clarence Hilliard.  They observed the lineup separately, but Janice Whitten was unable to identify the defendant; in fact, she identified another individual.  Clarence Hilliard, however, did select the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometime before 7 August 1975, Martha Ann Mack and her boyfriend, Rodney Harris, had gone with the defendant and Bobby Bowden in defendant's yellow Maverick to a bank in Fayetteville for business purposes.  After Martha Ann Mack and Rodney Harris had gotten out of the vehicle, Martha noticed that Harris had her pistol in his pocket.  She suggested that he not carry it into the bank so he returned with the gun to the car.  The day before 7 August 1975, Martha Ann Mack went to the hospital to see her boyfriend, Rodney Harris.  When she inquired about her pistol, he told her he had left it in defendant's yellow Maverick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of 7 August 1975, the defendant and Bobby Bowden went to Martha Ann Mack's trailer to return the gun.  It was later determined that bullets from this gun killed Larry Lovett and Norma Ehrhart.  While at the trailer, the defendant told Martha Ann Mack in the presence of Bobby Bowden that they were responsible&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the Seven-Eleven robbery and murders.  She questioned his statement so defendant suggested that she listen to the 11 p.m. news which appeared on television shortly thereafter, and this was done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant and Bobby Bowden were arrested at defendant's trailer in the early morning hours of 12 August 1975.  As a result of information provided by Alice Cousin, the defendant's wife, officers were able to secure the pistol from Martha Ann Mack's trailer the same morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December of 1975, Janice Whitten reported to the police the license plate number of the yellow Maverick seen at the Seven-Eleven Store.  She testified that she remembered the numbers of the plate because she got in the habit, when she lived in Ohio, of memorizing plate numbers to use in playing the &quot;numbers&quot; game.  The letters on the plate, HJW, she recalled because they included her initials and Clarence Hilliard's last initial.  The license number described by Janice Whitten matched the license number of a Maverick automobile in defendant's yard on the night of his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's evidence tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City-County identification records and photographs of the men who appeared in the 12 August 1975&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lineup with defendant revealed that their complexions ranged from medium to dark.  However, defendant's own complexion in the photograph on file appeared to be medium rather than light, and defendant's witness admitted that the photographs of individuals varied depending on the development process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When recalled to the stand, Clarence Hilliard testified that he remembered the license plate on the Maverick being dirty.  He recollected Janice Whitten's mentioning the letters of the license plate shortly after the robbery but had no further conversations with her about the license number.  Hilliard confirmed that Janice Whitten got her ideas for betting from numbers she observed on license plates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant did not testify in his own behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The co-defendant, Bobby Bowden, was tried and convicted of the same offenses at the 15 December 1975 Criminal Session, Cumberland County Superior Court.  On appeal of that case to our Court, we found No Error.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">State v. Bowden</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 290 N.C. 702, 228 S.E. 2d 414 (1976).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the Cumberland County Superior Court, Criminal Session (North Carolina), which convicted him of two counts of first-degree murder, sentenced him to death, and arrested judgment for his armed robbery conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police went to defendant's trailer based on a lead as to an armed robbery and murder. Defendant's wife was home and directed the police to where the gun used in the crime was located and to a friend of defendant's that admitted defendant was involved in the crime. Defendant was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and with armed robbery. The lower court convicted him on both murder counts, sentenced him to death, and arrested judgment for his armed robbery conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and remanded the matter with instructions to impose a life sentence. The court held that no errors were committed at trial with respect to the husband-wife evidentiary privilege because the gun was not a confidential statement between spouses. Moreover, defendant's wife did not testify and none of her statements were admitted into evidence. Nor was error committed in the admission of the victim's dying declarations, which were voluntarily made while he was conscious of impending death. As to the denial of defendant's request for a continuance, it was a matter within the trial judge's discretion and did not deprive defendant of his right to counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but remanded the matter with instruction to impose a sentence to life imprisonment instead of death.</SPAN></P>

Appeal by State from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Judge Perry Martin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 3 May 1976 Criminal Session of the Superior Court of Lenoir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 30 November 1975 defendant, Freddie Smith, was charged in a uniform traffic citation with driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of G.S. 20-138(a), his fourth offense.  The citation incorporated a detailed statement of his previous three convictions for the same offense.  Upon his trial in the District Court on 6 January 1976, defendant pled not guilty and was found guilty as charged.  From a sentence of imprisonment he appealed to the Superior Court.  When defendant gave notice of appeal, as required by G.S. 15A-928(d) for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trial in the Superior Court, the District Attorney filed &quot;superseding statements&quot; of the charges, separately alleging the substantive offense of operating a motor vehicle on the public highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and the facts of defendant's prior convictions for violations of G.S. 20-138(a).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon his arraignment at the 3 May 1976 Criminal Session of the Superior Court, prior to entering his plea to the charges against him, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant moved to quash &quot;the entire statement of charges on the grounds that the statutes under which the statement is drawn, [G.S. 15A-928] . . . is unconstitutional, [and] deprives the defendant, Freddie Smith, of his right to trial by jury. . . .&quot; Whereupon, Judge Martin summarily entered judgment &quot;that the defendant's motion to quash the statement of charges is allowed for that the statutory scheme allowing such a two-count statement of charges when a multiple offense of driving under the influence is charged is unconstitutional under the U. S. and North Carolina Constitutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this judgment the State appealed, and we allowed its petition for certification to this Court for initial appellate review under G.S. 7A-31(b)(2).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed a judgment of the Criminal Session of Lenoir County Superior Court (North Carolina), which granted defendant's motion to quash the statement of charges. The superior court found that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-928, which allowed a two-count statement of charges when multiple offenses of driving under the influence (DUI) was charged, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statement of charges separately alleged the substantive DUI offense and the facts of defendant's three prior DUI convictions. Defendant attacked the constitutionality of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-928, which provided for the two-count statement of charges. He argued that &sect; 15A-928 was unconstitutional because it permitted the question of his guilt of multiple offenses to be determined without submission of the entire case to the jury. The superior court allowed his motion to quash the statement of charges, but the court reversed on appeal. The court held that &sect; 15A-928 was immune to defendant's attack and did not deprive him of a jury trial. Section 15A-928 allowed defendant to judicially admit his prior convictions, which precluded the State from adducing evidence of them and required the submission of the case to the jury without reference to them as if they were not an element of the offense. There was a higher penalty for repeated convictions, and, thus, the statement of charges must have alleged the prior convictions. In the absence of a judicial admission by defendant, the question as to whether or not there were prior convictions was for the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Albright, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 24 March 1975 Special Session, Durham Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in separate bills of indictment with the crimes of kidnapping, armed robbery and first-degree murder.  The cases were consolidated for trial and defendant, through his court-appointed counsel William M. Sheffield, entered a plea of not guilty to each charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered the testimony of Kenneth Earl Blake who, in substance, testified that on the night of 20 July 1974, he and defendant saw Howard Ellis at about 10:45 p.m. near North Durham Five Points.  Ellis, an acquaintance of defendant, was a security guard.  Defendant and Blake entered Ellis' automobile.  Defendant sat in the front seat and talked to Ellis while Blake sat in the back seat and smoked a cigarette.  After a short time defendant and Blake went to the Duke Tavern where they had some beer.  They left the tavern some time after midnight and defendant flagged Ellis down near Carpenter Motors in Durham.  When Ellis stopped the car defendant pulled out a .38 caliber pistol, ordered Ellis out of the car and took his pistol.  He gave the pistol to Blake and upon defendant's instructions both Ellis&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Blake entered the rear of the automobile.  Defendant then drove to a deserted house on Scoggins Street where, after ordering Ellis out of the car, he took the officer's handcuffs and handcuffed his hands behind his back.  In response to defendant's questions, Ellis stated that the only money he had was a $ 100 check in the back of the car.  Thereupon defendant took a box containing green bags from the trunk of the car and placed it on the back seat.  Blake found a check in the box.  Defendant then took Ellis into the house and shortly thereafter Blake heard four shots.  Defendant came out of the house alone and drove Ellis' automobile to the corner of Gary and Liberty Streets where he and Blake removed a shotgun, a nightstick, a flashlight, shotgun shells and bullets.  They left on foot and returned to defendant's home where they found Willie Laney and George Cleveland who had been with them earlier that night.  The four of them went to the location where the property was hidden and picked up the guns, ammunition and other property.  A few days later, in response to questions by Officers Roop and Rigsbee, Blake related the happenings of 20 July 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination, Blake&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  admitted to defense counsel that he had previously told him that the district attorney had assured him that if he presented false testimony against defendant Tatum he would be paid certain sums of money, charges would not be brought against him and he would not have to spend any time in jail.  He further admitted that he told defense counsel that he testified for the State at the preliminary hearing because of these promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered further testimony of police officers to the effect that the body of Howard Ellis was found on 22 July 1974 at a house on Scoggins Street.  He was lying on his back with handcuffs on his wrists and there were four bullet wounds in his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Cleveland and Willie Laney testified that they were in the presence of defendant and Kenneth Earl Blake in the early part of the night of 20 July 1974 and at that time defendant was armed with a pistol.  Both of these witnesses saw defendant and Blake enter the automobile of deceased and sit there for about five minutes.  After midnight they accompanied defendant and Blake to the place where they picked up a shotgun, blackjack and some ammunition.  They all returned to defendant's home and Blake told&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  them about the shooting and the taking of the property.  Their testimony generally corroborated Blake's account of the shooting and theft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State also offered evidence tending to show that defendant's fingerprints and Blake's fingerprints were taken from the Ellis automobile.  There was medical testimony tending to show that Ellis died as a result of the gunshot wounds to his head.</SPAN></P>

They went to an old house at the corner of Liberty and Gary Streets where Blake removed a shotgun, nightstick and a pistol from nearby bushes and placed them in defendant's car.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged in separate bills of indictment with the crimes of kidnapping, armed robbery and first-degree murder.

The court held that defendant had no right to inspect the notes of the investigating police officers under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-155.4. The court found that the appointment of an expert was within the discretion of the trial judge and that the denial of defendant's motion for the appointment of an investigator did not violate his constitutionally guaranteed rights to equal protection of the laws. The court substituted a sentence of life imprisonment in lieu of the death penalty because the United States Supreme Court had invalidated the death penalty provisions of N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant appeals pursuant to G.S. 7A-27(a) from judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McKinnon, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered at the 15 December 1975 Criminal Session, Cumberland County Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On indictments, proper in form, defendant was charged and found guilty of two counts of first degree murder and one of armed robbery and the death sentence was imposed.  No judgment was entered for the armed robbery conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deceased Larry Lovett left for work around 6:00 a.m. on 7 August 1975.  He was employed by McArthur Road Seven-Eleven Store in Fayetteville and was familiar with the fact that $ 125.00 was always placed in the floor safe when the store closed at night.  He had been instructed not to resist a robbery and did not own or carry a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before 7:00 a.m. on the same morning, deceased Norma Ehrhart left her home to pick up a few groceries at the Seven-Eleven Store.  About the same hour, Clarence Hilliard and Janice Whitten left for work together and planned to stop at the same store to pick up some cigarettes.  They pulled up outside the store at 7:10 a.m. Both of them noticed a yellow Maverick automobile parked alongside their car, and shortly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thereafter saw a light-complexioned black man come out of the store and get in the driver's side of the Maverick automobile.  Clarence Hilliard waited in the car while Janice Whitten got out and headed for the double-door entrance-way.  As she reached the doors, she observed a dark-complexioned black man come out of the store and head for the Maverick.  Janice Whitten later identified the defendant as this man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Janice Whitten walked into the store and noticed no clerks in sight and that it was very quiet.  She waited a while and another customer came in.  While she was talking to the other customer, they heard muffled, moaning sounds coming from the back storage room.  They went to the storage room door and opened it.  There Janice Whitten saw Larry Lovett, lying on his left side, bleeding from his head and stomach.  Close by lay Norma Ehrhart, also bleeding.  Both had been shot and were breathing faintly.  Janice Whitten ran to the front of the store to call the police and summon Clarence Hilliard.  When she came back to the storeroom, she bent over Larry Lovett to inquire about his condition.  He responded &quot;I've been shot, I've been shot in the gut . . .  Didn't you see them?&quot; By&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this time Clarence Hilliard was in the storeroom asking Larry Lovett what happened.  Larry replied, &quot;didn't you see them, the two Black dudes?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon thereafter, officers from the Sheriff's department arrived.  Norma Ehrhart appeared to be dead and Larry Lovett was still struggling.  Ambulances took them to the hospital where both were pronounced dead on arrival.  It was determined that $ 124.89 had been taken from the floor safe.  Janice Whitten and Clarence Hilliard told the officers what they had seen in the store but did not mention the two black males they had seen leaving in the yellow Maverick.  Later the same day when they heard of the death of Larry Lovett, they went to the Law Enforcement Center and reported that they had seen two black men leaving the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four days later, they returned to the Center and each identified the defendant separately from photographs.  As a result of this identification, defendant was arrested that night, as well as his co-defendant Gregory Cousin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, 12 August 1975, a lineup was held in which the defendant was one of six persons shown to Janice Whitten and Clarence Hilliard.  They observed the lineup separately, but neither was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  able to positively identify the defendant, although Clarence Hilliard first identified the defendant and later changed his opinion.  As a matter of fact, they each identified two other individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometime before 7 August 1975, Martha Ann Mack and her boyfriend, Rodney Harris, had gone with the defendant and Gregory Cousin in Cousin's yellow Maverick to a bank in Fayetteville for business purposes.  After Martha Ann Mack and Rodney Harris had gotten out of the vehicle, Martha noticed that Harris had her pistol in his pocket.  She suggested that he not carry it into the bank so he returned with the gun to the car.  The day before 7 August 1975, Martha Ann Mack went to the hospital to see her boyfriend, Rodney Harris.  When she inquired about her pistol, he told her he had left it in the yellow Maverick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of 7 August 1975, the defendant and Gregory Cousin went to Martha Ann Mack's trailer to return the gun.  It was later determined that bullets from this gun killed Larry Lovett and Norma Ehrhart.  While at the trailer, Cousin told Martha Ann Mack in the presence and hearing of the defendant that they were responsible for the Seven-Eleven robbery and murders.  She questioned&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his statement and Cousin suggested that she listen to the 11:00 p.m. news which appeared on television shortly thereafter and this was done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A short time after defendant visited Martha Ann Mack, he went to see his girlfriend, Geraldine Parker.  He was nervous and indicated that he had something to tell her.  After a few hours he told her he had shot someone who held a gun on his partner.  He suggested that she keep the yellow Maverick for a while in Vass, North Carolina and told her that he would leave the State.  The next afternoon when Geraldine again saw the defendant, he gave her more details about the shooting and told her he was going to New Orleans to get rid of the car.  He left her but was arrested before departing for New Orleans.  The next morning Geraldine Parker called the Sheriff's Department and gave them the information she had received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other facts necessary to the decision will be discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two witnesses saw defendant as he left a carry-out, then entered and found the clerks, who had been shot. Both died, but one identified two black males as the offenders. Both witnesses identified defendant from a photo array, but they were unable to identify him at a lineup. They both identified defendant at trial. The owner of the gun used in the robbery and murder testified that the co-defendant had told her in defendant's presence that he and defendant had committed the crimes, and defendant did not deny it. A jury found defendant guilty of two counts of first-degree murder, and robbery, and the trial judge imposed the death sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The control of the jury voir dire, and whether challenges were allowed was within the trial court's discretion, as were the rulings that allowed evidence of the co-defendant's statement to be used against defendant as an implied admission, and the dying declaration. The United States Supreme Court had invalidated the death penalty provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17, and the court ordered that a sentence of life imprisonment was substituted for the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the defendant's convictions for two first-degree murders, and ordered the trial court to enter judgments that vacated the death sentence and imposed life imprisonment for the two convictions.</SPAN></P>

Stat. 7A-31, to review the judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Walker, S.J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the November 10, 1975 Special Non-Jury Civil Session of Guilford County Superior Court.  This action was instituted by the plaintiff-appellee, the Clerk of the Superior Court of Guilford County [hereinafter clerk], pursuant to the North Carolina Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. 1-253&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to determine the ownership of funds which he held in his official capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In thirty-four criminal actions tried in the courts of Guilford County various judgments were entered which included provisions that each defendant pay money to the clerk for disbursement of the funds to various state and local agencies.  Defendants are either those state and local agencies to which funds were ordered to be disbursed, including defendant-appellant City of Greensboro, or were various boards of education, including defendant-appellee Guilford County Board of Education, that claimed entitlement to the funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clerk asked for a judgment advising and instructing him whether the funds which he held as a consequence of these judgments&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  should be paid to the recipients designated in the jugdments or to the Guilford County Treasurer for the use of public schools as the clerk contended was required by the North Carolina Constitution, Article IX, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After answers were filed by all defendants and a pretrial order entered, Judge Walker entered his ruling based upon the pleadings, the stipulations of the parties and the judgments themselves as exhibits.  He found that the monies ordered paid in the judgments in question were fines within the meaning of Article IX, &sect; 7 of the North Carolina Constitution.  He concluded and so decreed that these monies belonged to Guilford County for the use of the public schools; that provisions of the judgments insofar as they directed monies elsewhere were null and void; and that the clerk should disburse the monies to the Treasurer of Guilford County and in so doing would be exonerated from liability.</SPAN></P>

The court modified and affirmed the judgment, holding that all funds were to go to the county, and all but one of the judgments was indeed a fine. The one non-fine judgment was ordered as restitution to the police department, and the judgment was so modified. The court held that N.C. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Lanier, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 10 June 1974 Session of the Superior Court of Lenoir, docketed as Case No. 51 at the Fall Term 1974, argued as Case No. 34 at the Spring Term 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In separate bills of indictment, drawn under G.S. 14-87 and G.S. 15-144 and returned 11 March 1974, each defendant was individually charged (1) with the robbery of Edna Barwick with firearms and (2) with the murder of George A. Grant on 28 December 1973.  The four cases were consolidated for trial.  In separate verdicts each defendant was found (1) guilty of the common law robbery of Mrs. Barwick and (2) guilty of the first degree murder of George A. Grant.  Upon the verdicts of guilty of first degree murder each defendant received a death sentence; upon the verdicts of guilty of common law robbery each defendant received a sentence of ten years imprisonment to commence upon the expiration of the sentences in the murder cases.  Each defendant appealed from the sentence of death directly to this Court under G.S. 7A-27(a).  The appeal of each from his conviction of common law robbery was certified to this Court under G.S. 7A-27(a) for simultaneous, initial appellate review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uncontradicted evidence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tends to show that the deceased, Grant, was the owner-operator of a general merchandising store located in a rural area in Lenoir County.  In the front store yard, which was well lighted, were two gas pumps and a large oak tree.  Shortly before 8:30 p.m. on 28 December 1973, Mr. Grant was killed during the course of a robbery of the store.  Mrs. Barwick, who was employed by him as a clerk, was working at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately upon the impanelment of the jury, the court conducted a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing to determine whether Mrs. Barwick would be allowed to make an in-court identification.  On </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, she testified as to her observation of the men who committed the robbery and murder and identified defendants as participants.  (Mrs. Barwick's testimony in this regard was essentially the same as her later testimony before the jury and, for that reason, it will be stated only in the resume of the evidence presented to the jury.) Relevant to the admissibility of her in-court identification the evidence presented at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tended to show the additional facts set out below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Barwick testified as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty or forty minutes after the incident she told investigating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  officers, Deputy Sheriff Garris, and SBI Agent Slaughter, that the men who entered the store were kind of tall, in their early twenties, not clean shaven, and they had short Afro haircuts.  One of them was wearing a yellowish toboggan with a red and green stripe around it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the days that followed Mrs. Barwick said, on at least ten different occasions the officers brought her eight to twelve black and white photographs of black men.  Some of these photographs were submitted to her more than once, but she was not able to identify any of them.  On one occasion she viewed a lineup of ten young black men at the Wayne County jail.  She told Garris that none of the men who were in the store at the time of the robbery was in that lineup, but that the face of the second man from the left resembled the one who wore the toboggan.  (At this point in her testimony she indicated Joseph Foster.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not until 15 February 1974, when Officers Garris, Slaughter, and O'Quinn showed her two colored &quot;photographic lineups&quot; (State's Exhibits 8 and 9) that she identified the pictures of Davis and Foster as two of the men who were in Sparky Grant's grocery at the time of the robbery.  She said that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  when she saw those pictures she &quot;just knew they were the ones.&quot; In answer to the solicitor's question, &quot;Now, how positive are you of your identification of these two young men?&quot; Mrs. Barwick answered, &quot;I just know I'm sure, yes, I know I'm sure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon cross-examination on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Barwick was asked if she had seen a striking resemblance between any person in the color photographs and any person in the black and white photographs which had been exhibited to her before 15 February 1973.  She replied that she thought she had seen some before but she wasn't positive until she saw the color photographs.  Counsel for defendants then handed her State's Exhibits 2-A through 2-J, and she indicated that she now thought picture 2-I was a picture of one of the persons who came in Grant's store on 28 December 1973; that it bore such a striking resemblance to defendant Davis it could have been a picture of the individual who was in the store.  (This picture was not a picture of Davis.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Barwick said further that at the time she was shown Exhibits 8 and 9 she had read in the paper that certain individuals whom she did not know had been arrested for the robbery and homicide in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  question and were in the Lenoir County jail.  She did not ask the officers who brought her the pictures, or anybody else, if the two she selected were persons they had in jail, and nothing said to her at the time indicated that they were.  On previous occasions when she had asked them &quot;if they had any evidence or anything,&quot; they had always told her they could tell her nothing.  She was never told that the suspects were persons living in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of Mrs. Barwick's testimony on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the court heard SBI Agent Slaughter.  His testimony, both on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and before the jury, with reference to the descriptions which Mrs. Barwick gave him, as well as her account of the events which followed their entrance, was substantially the same.  It will be summarized hereafter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SBI Agent Slaughter and Deputy Sheriff Garris both testified on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with respect to the pretrial identification procedures they employed.  According to them, they talked with Mrs. Barwick several times a week over a period of seven weeks.  On at least six occasions they showed her photographs.  On three of these occasions, all before 15 February 1973, black and white pictures&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of defendants, taken from a three or four-year-old high school annual, were among those exhibited.  These pictures were first included among a group of &quot;loose&quot; photographs, introduced in evidence on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as State's Exhibits 3A through 3Z and 3A-1-2.  Later Mrs. Barwick was shown these black and white pictures of defendants as part of various &quot;albums.&quot; These albums (State's Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7) were manila folders in each of which had been pasted four to five black and white photographs of black males.  S-4 contained defendant Davis' picture; S-5 contained defendant Foster's; S-6 contained both pictures; S-7 contained no picture of either.  Mrs. Barwick failed to identify the black and white photographs of defendants either as part of the loose ones presented to her or when included in the albums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing, Deputy Garris testified that the police had arrested one James Hodges in late January in connection with the present crime.  Over defendants' objections Deputy Garris stated that Hodges told him that he, along with defendants, was at Grant's store on 28 December.  He was outside when he heard a shot.  He ran inside and saw defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Davis with a gun in his hand holding a white lady while Foster was taking money from the cash register.  Acting pursuant to this information, police arrested Davis and Foster in early February 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon their arrest, defendants were photographed in color and their pictures placed in two albums.  (State's Exhibits 8 and 9.) On 15 February, Agent Slaughter and Deputy Garris showed those albums to Mrs. Barwick.  They asked her to look at the pictures and determine whether she could identify anybody among them.  There was no discussion of the photographs.  After looking &quot;a couple of minutes&quot; she identified the photographs of Davis and Foster as being the two people who had been in the store on the night of the robbery.  Several minutes afterwards, she said to Agent Garris, &quot;These are the two that were in the store, aren't they?&quot; He told her he could make no statement as to any identification she made, and the officers then left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Judge Lanier found facts relative to Mrs. Barwick's opportunity to observe the men who committed the robbery and homicide.  He also made substantial factual findings concerning the pretrial identification procedures employed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by Agent Slaughter and Deputy Garris which were summarized above.  Judge Lanier concluded &quot;as a matter of law&quot; that Mrs. Barwick's in-court identification of defendants Davis and Foster was based on her independent observation at the time and scene of the crime and it was not influenced or tainted by other pretrial identification acts or procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this ruling each defendant objected and excepted to the findings as being insufficient to support the court's conclusion &quot;relative to the in-court identification.&quot; Each defendant &quot;renewed his motion to suppress the testimony and identification by Edna Barwick.&quot; Each defendant also objected to the court's failure to find certain evidentiary facts which they contended diminished the reliability of Mrs. Barwick's identification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the court's determination that her in-court identification would be admissible Mrs. Barwick, a 44-year-old widow of ten years, testified before the jury, in summary, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For eight months prior to 28 December 1973 she had worked as a clerk in the store of Sparky Grant, a 45-year-old married man living with his family.  She had been Sparky's &quot;girl friend&quot; for ten years and was in love with him.  On&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thursday evening, 27 December 1973, they had closed the store at 9:00 p.m. and gone to her home, ten miles away.  At 4:00 a.m. she drove him back to the store, where she left him at 4:30 a.m. and returned home.  When she reported for work at 10:30 that morning she had had four hours sleep.  Except for the hour between 1:00 and 2:00 p.m. Mrs. Barwick remained in the store until after Grant was shot about 8:30 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 8:10 p.m. Grant and Mrs. Barwick were preparing to close the store.  He was in the storage room, and she was stocking the drink cooler when Julia Green, who lived in a trailer in the store yard, came in and made a purchase.  After Julia left, her daughter, Sandra, came in and also made a purchase.  When Sandra left, Mrs. Barwick went back to restocking the drink cooler, standing about two feet from the front door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A short time after Sandra left, Mrs. Barwick &quot;glimpsed up&quot; and saw two bare headed black males come in the door.  At that time she did not &quot;get a mental picture of what they looked like as individuals.&quot; One went to the beer cooler and one went back where she lost sight of him.  This man she made no effort to describe or identify.  However, she&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  did see the one at the beer cooler, and she identified him as the defendant Tharoy Davis.  She observed him pull back the door to the cooler, reach in with his right hand, and pull out a carton of Miller High Life beer.  &quot;I was looking at him,&quot; she said.  At that time she thinks she did get a mental picture of him.  She immediately filled the drink box and went inside the counter area to the cash register.  At that time Grant was in the storage room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was only a few seconds after Mrs. Barwick lost sight of the man who went to the back that Davis placed the beer on the counter, and she &quot;waited to put the beer in the bag and for him to pay [her].&quot; She then faced him across the counter, a foot and a half away, and she observed him standing there.  He had two or three dollar bills in his left hand but made no attempt to pay her.  Mrs. Barwick's first effort to bag the beer was unsuccessful because the bag she had pulled from under the counter was too small.  She got another and was putting the carton in the bag when she heard a loud gunshot in the back of the store.  At that time there was nobody in the store but the two men, Grant, and Mrs. Barwick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shot was followed immediately&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the sound or someone running from the back to the front of the store, on her left as she faced the back of the store.  At the same time she was also conscious that the man who had brought the beer to the counter had moved and was &quot;coming back of, to the inside of the counter&quot; where she was.  Then someone, whom she did not see, grabbed her from behind.  She does not know who grabbed her because she did not see him but she thinks it was Davis, the man who was standing at the counter when the gun went off.  He bent her head over with his body, and pulled her toward him.  With his right arm around her he held both her arms so that neither was free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Barwick described herself at the moment as being &quot;just scared to death&quot; because she was afraid she was going to be shot.  At that point someone snatched open the cash register, which contained between two and three hundred dollars, and she saw two hands taking out the money.  At the time she was grabbed she heard someone enter the store, and a second later she observed a third hand go into the register.  In all, she saw three black hands remove money from the cash register, but at no time was she able to see whose hands they were although&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  she was certain they belonged to three different people.  The left hand of the person holding her went into the cash drawer.  She saw another hand and a bare arm come across the counter where the beer was, and a third hand and arm came from the other side of the counter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When all the money was withdrawn Mrs. Barwick heard two people leave the store.  She turned and looked toward the door.  There she saw a man, whom she later identified as defendant Foster, standing two or three feet from the door and three feet from her.  He had on a yellowish toboggan with a green and red stripe around it, which he was trying to pull over his face.  He was wearing baggy khaki pants and a faded blue jean coat.  The man &quot;stood there a few seconds trying to pull the toboggan down and then went out the front door running pretty fast.&quot; In all it was &quot;just a few seconds&quot; from the time she was grabbed before she saw Foster.  At that time she got &quot;a mental picture of him.&quot; In her opinion &quot;the last one in the store and the last one out of the store was the same person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Barwick never saw either defendant or anyone else with a gun.  She had never seen either one before the time of the robbery, and the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  individual who brought the beer to the counter never spoke a word to her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As soon as the men left, Mrs. Barwick ran to the back of the store where she found Sparky lying on the floor dead.  He had been shot in the temple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Barwick's first act was to call the Goldsboro telephone operator, seeking emergency assistance.  At that time it was about 8:30 p.m. She then went to Julia Green's trailer.  After telling Julia and her friend, Ed Sutton, that Sparky had been shot and requesting them to call the sheriff or the rescue squad, she returned to the store.  After a few minutes alone at the store Mrs. Barwick, feeling so &quot;nervous and shocked&quot; that she &quot;couldn't stand it longer,&quot; went back to the trailer somewhere between 8:30 and 8:45 p.m. and asked Julia and Sutton to come and stay with her.  At her request Julia called Grant's brother, and Sutton called Mrs. Grant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In due course Lenoir County Deputy Sheriff Garris and SBI Special Agent Slaughter came to the store.  Mrs. Barwick tried to tell them, as best she could, what had happened and to describe the persons who were in the store at the time of the shooting and robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told the officers that the three young blacks came&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  into the store and she described two of them.  The one she saw in the door, she described as wearing a beige or yellowish toboggan with a green and yellow stripe around it, khaki pants, and a faded-out blue jean coat.  The one who got the beer looked like &quot;he might have had a short Afro haircut&quot; and looked like he was &quot;kind of tall.&quot; He wore a blue knit shirt and dark pants, and didn't look &quot;two clean shaven.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the solicitor's questions Mrs. Barwick stated that she was positive &quot;that the defendant Tharoy Davis was in Sparky Grant's grocery store on the night of December 28, 1973, purchasing beer at the time of the gunshot.&quot; She said she was also positive that &quot;the defendant, Joseph Foster, was in Sparky Grant's grocery store near the door very shortly after the gunshot on the night in question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julia Green testified that she went to the store about 8:05 p.m., stayed only a few moments, and returned home.  Her daughter, Sandra, went to the store immediately thereafter and was gone only several minutes.  At about 8:30 p.m. Mrs. Barwick came to her trailer visibly shaken and crying.  Mrs. Barwick told her &quot;that three colored guys had shot Sparky.&quot; Julia's daughter, Sandra, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testified that when she went to the store she saw Mr. and Mrs. Bowden, whom she knew.  He was sitting in a big green car near the gas pumps.  In the store she saw Mrs. Bowden with whom she later went outside.  At that time Mr. Grant was outside the store at the ice machine getting Mrs. Bowden some ice.  The Bowdens drove away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clarence Jones, Jr., a witness for the State, whose name was not furnished to defendants prior to trial, testified over their objection, in summary, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 8:00 p.m. on 28 December 1973 Jones left his home and drove three miles to Sparky Grant's grocery store.  As he went into the store yard he saw a late model Mercury, either blue or green, leave the gas pumps.  He saw no other vehicles in the immediate vicinity of the store.  As he entered the store he saw Mrs. Barwick and Sparky Grant standing at the counter together.  They were not engaged in conversation, and the place seemed very quiet to him.  When he spoke to them and remarked that he wanted something to eat they made no response.  During the five or six minutes he was in the store buying some cakes and bananas, Sandra Green came in and made a purchase.  To his knowledge, only Mr. Grant, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Barwick, and Sandra Green were in the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John D. Foster, the 20-year-old brother of defendant Joseph Foster, aged 21, and a first cousin of defendant Davis, was also under indictment for the murder of Sparky Grant.  He was not tried with defendants but was called as a witness for the State.  He gave testimony on direct examination which tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, 28 December 1973, he and Joseph were home on leave from the Army.  John D. was staying with his friend, Ethel Mae Leftwridge; Joseph, with Tharoy Davis' mother, his aunt.  During the afternoon of December 28th, John D., Joseph, Tharoy, and James Hodges, the 20-year-old brother of Ethel Mae Leftwridge, got together at Central Heights near Goldsboro.  At that time John D. was &quot;pretty well high.&quot; James Hodges, whose nickname is &quot;Juney Boy,&quot; had also been drinking but not as much as John D. They all &quot;went somewhere,&quot; first into Goldsboro to get a jack for Tharoy's tape recorder and then to Kinston, in Tharoy's white 1967 Mustang.  Tharoy drove; Joseph sat on the front seat by him; John D. and Juney Boy occupied the back seat.  They went to the home of Jack Foster, the father of John D. and Joseph, who lives in Lenoir&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  County near Seven Springs, several times before they found him there about dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 8:00 p.m. the four left Jack Foster's and started home.  En route they stopped at a store in the yard of which was a gas tank and a tree, which could have been a pecan or an oak.  Tharoy and Joe got out and went in the store.  They had been gone a couple of minutes when James got out of the car.  John D. remained in the back seat partly asleep.  He believes James went in the store, for he came back and asked him for a dime to get a pack of cigarettes.  John D. did not give him any money.  James again left the car and in about two or three minutes they all came back.  The car then went straight to Goldsboro.  Tharoy &quot;drives pretty fast and he took off regular, like he usually does.&quot; John D. &quot;just fell off to sleep and did not hear any discussion in the car.&quot; John D. said that he was sure Tharoy Davis and Joseph Foster went in the store first and together and that Hodges went in thereafter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination John D. stated that he was &quot;first arrested for this&quot; on 3 February 1976 at Fort Jackson and brought back to Kinston; that he had discussed his testimony in this case with his own attorney&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and with the solicitor; that he was testifying for the State because he wanted to get out of jail; that because of statements which had been made to him concerning his testimony he hoped the case against him was going to be dismissed, and he believed it would be.  His further testimony on cross-examination, summarized, except when quoted, tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first day he was in the Kinston jail he told Special Agent W. L. Slaughter of the SBI that while he was at home on furlough in December he saw Tharoy Davis on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Thursday</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after Christmas and requested Tharoy to take him and Juney Boy to see his father, Jack Foster.  Tharoy and Joe &quot;had agreed&quot; to do it.  When they went they left the Central Heights area in the afternoon.  He and Juney Boy had been drinking all the morning.  After spending some time in Goldsboro the four arrived at Jack Foster's house in the late afternoon.  He was not at home; so they went to Newman's Store to inquire about him.  From there they went to Lou Kornegay's home where Tharoy, Joseph and Juney Boy played basketball until dark.  From there they went to Uncle Smith's house for twenty minutes before returning to Jack Foster's home.  He had just come&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in from a hog killing.  Thereafter John D. and Joseph cut some firewood for their father and about 8:00 p.m. they left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John D. further testified that at no time while he was with the other three that day did he see any guns or hear anyone discuss robbing a store.  He did not see Tharoy or Joe with money in their hands, wadded up.  He did not recall at what store they last stopped or how long they were there.  He heard no gunshot on any occasion, and whenever they went back to Goldsboro they may have driven &quot;a little bit faster, not much so.  It was late at night.&quot; None of the four had a large Afro haircut, and all were clean shaven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John D. also testified: &quot;While we were at my father's house, my father asked Tharoy and Joe to come back on Saturday and take him and Mildred [his wife] to Farmville to Mildred's parents' house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On redirect examination John D. said: &quot;While we were at my dad's place I know that somebody tried to borrow some money, just enough to get a loaf of bread.  Me, Tharoy Davis, Joseph, my father and James, all tried to scrape up and get a loaf of bread. . . .&quot; When questioned about whether he had accompanied defendants to Jack Foster's home on Thursday the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  27th or Friday the 28th, he stated, &quot;I talked to Tharoy Davis on Thursday.  And he picked me up the next day.  I don't know what day it was he picked me up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over defendants' objections John D. further testified that last summer -- it could have been in the tobacco season -- he saw Joseph with a .38 pistol.  It was in a holster &quot;just laying in the foot at the boot of his car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucinda Carol Kornegay testified that she lived about five miles from Sparky Grant's grocery and that she knows Jack Foster, John D. Foster, Joseph Foster, Tharoy Davis, and James Hodges.  On Friday, December 28, 1973, between 3:00 and 3:30 p.m., they came to her house in a white Mustang, and John D., Tharoy and Joseph played basketball until leaving at about 5 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony of Jack Foster, the father of John D. and Joseph Foster, tended to show: He (Jack) lived four and one half miles from Sparky Grant's grocery.  On Friday afternoon, 28 December 1973, he killed hogs for Mr. Nathan Hardy.  Jack got home about 7:00 p.m., and thirty minutes later, Joseph, John D., Tharoy, and a boy Jack didn't know came to his house.  This boy &quot;had a boggan, tam, or what it looked like. . . .  It was dark looking, it was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  about dark when they came there.&quot; While there John D. cut some wood for his father and unsuccessfully tried to borrow some money from him.  Jack told Tharoy that he and his wife wanted to go to Farmville on Saturday, and Tharoy agreed to take them.  After having something to eat the boys left at 8:00 p.m., and Jack did not see any of them again until Saturday morning when Joseph and Tharoy came by to take him and his wife to Farmville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State called as a witness William E. Smith, a deputy sheriff of Lenoir County, whose name was not on the list of witnesses furnished defendants prior to trial.  Smith, who was the first officer to arrive at the scene, was substituted for Deputy Sheriff Pelletier, who became unable to testify after the trial began.  Over defendants' objection he testified, in substance, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of December 28th he was on duty in the Seven Springs area of Lenoir County.  About 8:23 p.m. he received a call to go to Sparky Grant's grocery to investigate an armed robbery and shooting.  Upon his arrivel he saw Julia Green and Mrs. Barwick standing in the store yard.  Mrs. Barwick came to his car and said, &quot;He's been shot.&quot; She further advised him that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  she had been robbed.  Upon entering the store he saw a six-pack carton of Miller High Life beer on the counter, the open cash register with only a few pennies in it, and some money on the floor.  In the back of the store he found Sparky's body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Barwick then told Smith that three colored males had been involved.  She described the first one &quot;as being slender built with a blue jean jacket and blue jean trousers and a light beard.  It looked like he hadn't shaved; it wasn't thick.&quot; The second man, she said, had a medium-light complexion, was heavy set, small and &quot;the hair was not too short.&quot; The third man was taller and slender and dark skinned.  Smith made no notes of what she told him, and he instructed her to wait and give the information to Deputy Sheriff Garris and the other officers when they arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William S. Slaughter, Special Agent of the SBI and Deputy Sheriff Garris arrived at the store about 9:43 p.m. The body had been removed.  They found Deputies Smith and Pelletier and Mrs. Barwick there.  As Slaughter entered the store he saw a six-pack of Miller High Life beer in a paper bag on the left counter.  He also observed two one dollar bills and a quarter on the opposite&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***23]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  side of the counter, the right side.  On the counter back of the cash register he found an opened pack of Kool cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slaughter's testimony as to what Mrs. Barwick (whom he described as &quot;very upset&quot;) told him had occurred follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She stated that at approximately 8:15 two black males entered the store; that one black male went to the rear of the store and another one went to the beer cooler; that the one at the beer cooler obtained a six pack of Miller High Life bottled beer and brought it back to the counter and he was paying for it or had four $ 1.00 bills in his hand and she was attempting to put a bag over the beer when she heard a loud noise; that one of the Negro males grabbed her and held her and she heard the one in the back of the store going to the front of the store.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point the record discloses the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Spence [attorney for Joseph Foster]: Request instructions, your Honor.  No Ruling.  The defendants each object and except to the Court's failure to rule.  Exception No. 540.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Slaughter then continued his account of what Mrs. Barwick had told him.  She had said that while one was holding her a third Negro male entered the store.  The first&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***24]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  one who went to the back of the store was in his early twenties, about five feet, six to eight inches tall, &quot;medium but muscular built,&quot; dark complexion, round facial features, wearing dark clothes, hair cut &quot;about a three-inch Afro.&quot; However, on cross-examination, Slaughter said that term was his; that Mrs. Barwick hadn't said &quot;Afro.&quot; When he asked her to estimate the length of the hair &quot;she held her fingers at approximately this height&quot; (witness demonstrated with two fingers).  She told Slaughter that the second individual was also in his early twenties, about the same height and build, dark complexion, and had &quot;a medium Afro.&quot; He wore dark clothes, a pullover sweater or shirt with buttons down the front.  The third individual was described as tall and heavier built.  He had a lighter complexion and was wearing a yellow toboggan with green stripes around it and a waist-length jacket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Slaughter the approximate height of Joseph Foster is five foot, seven and a half inches tall and his complexion is dark.  His approximate weight is 135-140 pounds.  Tharoy Davis is approximately five feet, ten or eleven inches tall, and his complexion is medium to dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the course of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***25]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his examination of the premises Slaughter photographed the inside of the building and did &quot;latent lift work,&quot; which is an attempt to recover latent fingerprints.  He recovered prints from the carton of beer on the counter and the beer cooler.  He was unable to get any from the cash register, the counter, or the package of Kools.  His search of the premises revealed four firearms in the store -- two .22 caliber rifles in the corner of the bedroom, a .22 caliber pistol underneath the mattress, and a .22 caliber pistol underneath the counter below the cash register.  In Grant's truck in the store yard he found a gun or rifle.  He also found a pistol in Mrs. Barwick's car and a .22 caliber, semi-automatic rifle at her home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of December 29th Agents Slaughter and Bailey watched Dr. Nye and Dr. Hillman perform the autopsy upon the body of Sparky Grant.  Bailey testified that, upon examining the wound he concluded it was inflicted by a .38 caliber bullet.  Dr. Nye pointed out to them the path of the bullet, and they observed that the exit wound was in the top of the head.  Acting upon this information he and Slaughter returned to the store to search for the projectile which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***26]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  killed Grant.  Once there Slaughter started looking for the bullet.  In consequence, he found a .38 caliber bullet hole on the 7th window and then found the bullet.  A thorough search of the floor area of the store revealed no cartridge casings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 3, 1974, Slaughter and Bailey acquired from Mrs. Barwick the purple blouse she was wearing on the night of December 28th.  Bailey took it, the latent fingerprints and firearms from the store and also those belonging to Mrs. Barwick to the SBI Laboratory in Raleigh.  There F. M. Hearst, Jr., an expert in firearms and toolmark identification, examined the .38 caliber bullet taken from the window casing and concluded that it could not have been fired by any of the six weapons Slaughter had collected.  Mr. Glenn Glesne, an expert laboratory analyst in the field of chemistry, blood and body fluids, analyzed the purple blouse which Mrs. Barwick was wearing the night of the homicide and obtained negative results for blood and gunpowder particles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen R. Jones, an expert in the identification of fingerprints, testified that he got fingerprints from the deceased, Sparky Grant, Mrs. Barwick, and defendants Davis and Foster.  He examined&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***27]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the eight latent fingerprints submitted to the SBI Laboratory by Agents Slaughter and Bailey.  He was able to identify two of them as the prints of Mrs. Barwick from the carton of Miller High Life beer and two as the prints of Grant from the package of Kools.  The other four lacked sufficient characteristics to make any identification whatever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. S. W. Nye, an expert pathologist, testified that for the bullet which killed Grant to have left such powder burns on his face, it was &quot;fired at a distance of greater than 12 inches and perhaps less than 24 inches.&quot; In his opinion it was a .32 caliber or larger.  It could have been a .38 caliber.  He did not believe it was as small as a .22 caliber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of the State's evidence each defendant moved to dismiss the charges against him for insufficient proof and renewed his motion to strike the testimony of Mrs. Barwick.  The motions were denied and defendants offered evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony of defendant Tharoy Davis, except when quoted, is summarized below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is 19 years old and a native of Goldsboro.  Having dropped out of school in the twelfth grade, he joined the Army in September 1973.  Immediately after he finished his basic&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***28]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  training he purchased a 1967 white Mustang.  In December 1973 his hair was short -- &quot;not even an inch long&quot; --, and he had no beard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tharoy has never seen, or been in Sparky Grant's store.  He never saw Sparky, and he had never seen Mrs. Barwick prior to the preliminary hearing in this case.  He did not go into Grant's grocery on either Thursday or Friday, December 27th or 28th.  Neither he nor anyone in his car had a gun on either of those days, and he was not present on any occasion during the 1973 Christmas holidays when a store was robbed or a storekeeper shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He came to his mother's home in Goldsboro on 18 December 1973 from Fort Gordon, Georgia, where he was stationed.  His cousin, Joseph Foster, who also lived with his mother, arrived on December 19th from Fort Dix, New Jersey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 2:30 p.m. on the Thursday after Christmas, Tharoy and Joseph, riding in Tharoy's white Mustang, picked up John D. and Juney Boy Hodges, both of whom had been drinking.  John D. requested Tharoy to take him to see his father, Jack Foster.  After a stop in Goldsboro to purchase a jack for Tharoy's tape recorder, the four drove to Jack Foster's home in Lenoir County.  Jack was not there so they&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***29]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  went to James Kornegay's house, where everybody played basketball until &quot;dusk dark&quot; except Tharoy &quot;and the Kornegay dude,&quot; who kept shooting by the porch light.  When they left, being thirsty from playing basketball, the group drove to Rock Newman's store.  &quot;There is not a big oak tree near that store.&quot; Tharoy had only twelve cents; so he asked Joseph to buy him a soda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Newman's store they went to the home of John Smith to see his daughter Catherine, who was a cousin of Joseph and John D. Foster.  After about an hour and forty-five minutes with the Smiths, about 8:00 p.m., the four returned to the home of Jack Foster.  They found him sorting scraps from some hogs he had killed.  They stayed at Jack Foster's &quot;a good two hours or two and a half hours more.&quot; John D. and Joseph helped their father chop some wood, and Tharoy promised to take Jack and his wife to Farmville on Saturday.  At 10:30 p.m. they left and returned to Goldsboro without making any stops.  They &quot;dropped John D. and Juney Boy off at Central Heights,&quot; where they lived, and at 11:00 p.m. they returned to the home of Tharoy's mother, who was waiting up for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following morning, Friday, December 28th, Tharoy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***30]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Joe slept until 11:00, when Mrs. Davis fixed breakfast for them.  About noon Tharoy and Joseph took the white Mustang to a truck stop at which his brother-in-law, Rufus McColl, worked as a mechanic.  With McColl's help he and Joseph put some fog lights and silver dust flaps on Tharoy's car.  From there Tharoy and Joseph went to Raeford, where they visited the Campbells, nephews and nieces of his sister.  They also went to the home of Mabel Bullock, where they stayed until 11:00 p.m. before returning to Goldsboro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to arrangements he had made with Jack Foster on Thursday Tharoy went with Joseph to Jack's home on Saturday and drove Jack and his wife to Farmville.  He returned them to their home about 4:30 p.m., and he and Joe then drove back to Goldsboro without stopping.  He remained in Goldsboro until 5 January 1974, when his leave was up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to a phone call from his mother he came back to Goldsboro the following week and &quot;learned that someone named Bob Garris was looking for him for doing something that he hadn't done.&quot; He called Mr. Garris and inquired what he wanted with him.  He was told they just wanted to ask him a few questions, and he talked with Garris&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***31]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Slaughter in Goldsboro.  He &quot;was not afraid right then because he knew he hadn't done anything.  He later did become afraid.&quot; With reference to their questions Tharoy testified: &quot;I told them I was at Jack Foster's house on Friday, December 28th.  That statement is true in a way and false in a way. . . .  I told them that I was at Jack Foster's house but I didn't tell them that I was there on the 28th. . . .  I didn't mean the 28th, I told him that I came there but not on the 28th.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With reference to John D.'s testimony, that after they left the home of Jack Foster they stopped at a store which had a big oak tree in the yard, Tharoy said, &quot;John D. must have been talking about Mr. Rock Newman's store when he referred to a big tree.&quot; However, he also said, &quot;There is not a big oak tree near that store.&quot; With reference to Jack Foster's testimony that the defendants left his home about 8:00 p.m. on Friday, December 28th, and that Tharoy took him to Farmville on the following day, Saturday, the 29th, Tharoy said that Jack Foster is an alcoholic who was drunk when he took him to Farmville and that &quot;he is telling a story on me.&quot; With reference to the testimony of Lou Kornegay he said that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***32]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  she probably deliberately lied on him; that she didn't like him &quot;no way.&quot; He said that he failed to tell the officers that he went to Raeford on December 28th because he couldn't think; that this was his first time in trouble and he was confused; that he did not know what was going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabel Bullock, called as a witness by defendant Davis, testified that Tharoy and Joseph came to her home in Raeford to see her daughter Patricia about 8:00 p.m. on 28 December 1973; that neither had long hair nor an Afro.  She was in their presence for about an hour, and they left sometime between 9:00 and 10:00.  She had never seen either one before that night.  They were both well mannered and behaved during the time they were in her home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rufus McColl, called as a witness by defendant Davis, testified that he is married to Tharoy's sister.  On the Friday after Christmas, December 28, 1973, Tharoy and Joseph came to the 117 truck stop in Goldsboro, where he then worked, to borrow an electric drill from him.  He lent them the drill and showed them how to put fog lights on Tharoy's white Mustang and how to adjust his muffler.  When he left the truck stop premises at 2:00 p.m. Tharoy and Joseph Foster&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***33]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were still there.  That night about 8:00 he saw John D. Foster and Juney Boy Hodges in Central Heights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Foster's evidence consisted of the testimony of Jacqueline Terresa Jackson.  In substance she said that on Friday, 28 December 1973, she went from Charlotte to the home of Mabel Bullock in Raeford, arriving there about 5:00 p.m.; that about 7:30 p.m. she and Patricia Bullock encountered Joseph Foster at a neighborhod store.  He offered to take them &quot;down the street because he was going that way.&quot; He took them two doors past Patricia Bullock's house to the home of Patricia Campbell, where he had left Tharoy.  He and Tharoy came back at 8:00, and they sat around in the dining room and talked until 9:30, when Joseph, Tharoy, and the two Patricias went across the street to a club until 11:30.  At that time Tharoy and Joseph left the club.  The two Patricias remained there until about midnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of all the evidence each defendant renewed his motion for a judgment of nonsuit and to suppress the testimony of Edna Barwick.  These motions were denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Lanier submitted to the jury the question of each defendant's guilt of armed robbery or common law robbery and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***34]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of murder in the first degree.  With reference to the indictments for murder the judge charged the jurors that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that either Tharoy Davis or Joseph Foster shot and killed George A. Grant while they were committing, or attempting to commit a robbery each would be guilty of murder in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After deliberating an hour and a half the jury found each defendant guilty of common law robbery and murder in the first degree.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In No. 74CR1103 (Davis, armed robbery) -- judgment arrested.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Lenoir (North Carolina) convicting them of first-degree murder and robbery and sentencing them to death and 10 years' imprisonment, respectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were convicted for shooting the victim to death while robbing a convenience store. The store's clerk was also present during the robbery. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's murder convictions but vacated their robbery convictions, and vacated their death sentences and imposed life imprisonment. The trial court did not err by allowing the clerk to testify that defendants were two of the three people who were in the store when she was robbed and the victim was killed. The clerk's photographic identification of defendants was not impermissibly suggestive. The clerk failed to identify defendants on different occasions when she was shown high school photos of them that were three to four years old, but she was able to identify them when shown pictures taken 40 days after the crime. Because the robbery was used to prove an essential element of the murder charge, separate judgments imposing additional punishment for the robbery could not stand. The court further held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17 (1969), under which defendant's were sentenced to death, was unconstitutional, and therefore imposed life imprisonment instead.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants' first-degree murder convictions were affirmed. Defendants' robbery convictions and death sentences were vacated and defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Smith, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at 5 May 1975 Criminal Session, Robeson Superior Court.  Each defendant gave notice of appeal but the appeals were not perfected because the State failed to serve its countercases.  We allowed petitions for writs of certiorari as to each defendant on 8 January 1976 to the end that their respective appeals might be perfected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants were charged in separate bills of indictment with murder in the first degree.  The cases were consolidated for trial over the objection of each defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered evidence which tended to show that on the morning of 13 December 1974 Coreene Jacobs was in the store operated by Mrs. Jacobs and her husband, Wade Jacobs.  During the morning, Eula Hunt arrived to clean the store and the Jacobs' dwelling which adjoined and was to the rear of the store.  At about 11:30 a.m., Mrs. Jacobs, Eula Hunt and Joseph Maxwell Cook were sitting in the store talking.  At that time three black men came into the store.  One of the men, later identified as Leroy Richardson, asked for a package of Winston cigarettes and Mrs. Jacobs started behind the counter to obtain the cigarettes.  Just as she reached the counter, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Richardson grabbed her and said, &quot;I want all of your money and your life.&quot; One of the men, later identified as James McEachin, pointed a knife toward Eula Hunt.  He tied her up and made her lie on the floor.  The third man, later identified as Coleman Covington, pointed a sawed-off shotgun in Mr. Cook's face.  Richardson forced Mrs. Jacobs to open the cash register, threw her to the floor and stood upon her body while he removed the money from the cash register.  After finding some money concealed beneath a round of cheese, he took a butcher knife used to cut cheese and stabbed Mrs. Jacobs in the neck.  Mr. Cook said, &quot;Please don't kill her.  She's give you all of her money.&quot; Then Richardson, still armed with the butcher knife and with the aid of Covington dragged Mr. Cook from the chair in which he was sitting.  When Mrs. Jacobs begged them not to kill Mr. Cook, Richardson replied, &quot;The white sonofabitch ought to have been dead.&quot; Covington and Richardson then stood Mr. Cook up and Richardson stabbed him in the back with the butcher knife.  Mr. Cook fell and Covington hit him on the head with an unidentified object.  He then hit Mrs. Jacobs on the head causing her to lose consciousness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wade Jacobs returned to the store with a load of sand at about 11:20 a.m. and at that time observed a man, later identified as David Wayne Nicholson, standing by a blue and white automobile.  The hood of the car was up and Nicholson stuck his head under the hood when Mr. Jacobs stopped.  Mr. Jacobs entered the store when he saw a hand motion from inside the building.  When he entered the store, he was struck from behind and upon turning, he saw Richardson run toward him with the butcher knife in his hand.  Mr. Jacobs met Richardson and caught his arm.  Covington joined the affray, using the sawed-off shotgun as a club.  McEachin cut Mr. Jacobs several times with a pocketknife.  The men forced Mr. Jacobs across the body of his wife into the living quarters where he tripped over a chair.  As he fell, he kicked Covington down and also delivered a blow to Richardson.  Then &quot;someone hollered run.&quot; The three black men ran out through the store and Mr. Jacobs obtained his shotgun and then ran to the front of the store where he saw Richardson enter the blue and white car on the passenger side.  He fired three shots toward the car and saw glass fall from the car.  The blue and white automobile&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  knocked down the mailbox and then proceeded down Highway 501 toward Laurinburg.  Hubert Faircloth observed the blue and white automobile while it was parked in front of the store and identified it as a &quot;Duster.&quot; On the same day, a blue and white &quot;Duster&quot; automobile was found in Laurinburg.  It was established that this automobile belonged to defendant Nicholson's sister.  The window on the right side was shattered and there was blood on the headrest on the passenger side.  Fingerprints lifted from the hood of this automobile were positively identified as being fingerprints of defendant David Wayne Nicholson.  Mr. Cook's wallet, Mrs. Jacobs' wallet, a sawed-off shotgun and a knife were subsequently found along Highway 501 between Jacobs' store and Laurinburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Bob Andrews, a pathologist who performed an autopsy on the body of Joseph Maxwell Cook, testified:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">My initial investigation of the body revealed a wound in the back of the right side of about an inch and a half long; it was located an inch and a half to the right of the midline, about twelve inches below the shoulder line on the right back.  I probed that wound, and it went through the chest wall in the back just below&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  the twelfth rib, through the lower lobe of the right lung, cut a portion of the diaphram (sic) on the right; went through the sac that covers the heart, and nicked the lower edge of the heart. . . .</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He testified that, in his opinion, Mr. Cook died as a result of hemorrhage caused by this wound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers who saw Covington upon his arrest on 15 December 1974, testified that he had scars on the right side of his face and head.  He gave one of the officers a pellet which he said he had picked out of his leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants offered no evidence and the jury returned verdicts of guilty as charged.  Each defendant gave notice of appeal from judgment imposing the death penalty.  </SPAN></P>

Defendants were convicted of first degree murder. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions, vacated the sentences of death, and ordered the imposition of sentences of life imprisonment. The court held that an in-court identification of defendants by three state witnesses was proper, a spontaneous utterance of a declarant pleading with one defendant to spare the victim's life was admissible, and coconspirators' statements to the police were properly admitted. The court rejected a claim that testimony of the victim's widow was only offered to buy pity and was prejudicial. The court further ruled that jury instructions regarding corroborative testimony and elements of murder properly stated the law. The court held that the trial court acted within its discretion in denying motions for severance because the charges related to the same crime. The court further held that authoritative common law invalidated the death penalty provisions of N.C. Gen.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On indictment, proper in form, defendant was charged with the murder of Thelma Jean Jones on 3 June 1975.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the first-degree, and the death sentence was imposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linda Faye Carroll, defendant's aunt, had been going with a married man named Zeno Jones for a few weeks.  Zeno Jones' wife, Thelma Jean Jones, was the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 3 June 1975 Linda Faye Carroll and Zeno Jones had been riding around together drinking vodka.  While they were riding, they had an argument because Jones said he was breaking up with her.  During the argument Linda Faye Carroll was hit in the face, whereupon she jumped out of the car some distance from Mina Weil Park in Goldsboro, North Carolina, and then walked to the park where she saw her nephew, the defendant, who was with Gwendolyn Sherrod, Annie Davis and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant then drove Gwendolyn Sherrod's car away from Mina Weil Park.  In this vehicle were Linda Faye Carroll, Gwendolyn Sherrod, Annie Davis, and George Faison.  Another car followed. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant went to a house on Slocumb Street and obtained a rifle from Alton Artis.  Linda Faye Carroll had a conversation with Annie Davis in front of defendant concerning how Zeno Jones had beaten her up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant then drove the car to a low rent housing project in Goldsboro, North Carolina, where Zeno Jones and his wife lived with their family.  Defendant with the rifle in his hand got out of the car accompanied by Linda Faye Carroll.  They walked towards 110 Dupont Circle, which was the home of Zeno Jones and his wife.  It was about 11:00 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linda Faye Carroll knocked on the door at 110 Dupont Circle.  A witness in the car testified that she saw defendant with the rifle in his hand.  He moved the lever, pointed the gun, and after some seconds a shot was fired.  Very soon after this, Linda Faye Carroll and defendant came back to the car.  Another witness had observed that defendant had a gun in the front of the Jones' apartment after the shot was fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zeno Jones testified that after he had been home for a while on this night he heard a knock on the door.  He, his wife and two children were in the apartment.  His wife went to the door and came back and told Zeno Jones that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  somebody was there to see him.  She went back to the door.  At this time defendant and Linda Faye Carroll were outside the door.  Zeno Jones testified that defendant shot his wife.  A rifle (State's Exhibit 1) was found behind the dwelling where defendant was arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Warren E. Parmalee was an expert medical witness.  He went to the Zeno Jones home, arriving about 11:45 p.m. He found Thelma Jean Jones lying on the inside of the door in the entry hallway with much blood around her.  There was an entry wound in the front of her face and an exit wound in the back of her neck.  It was his opinion that the probable cause of death was a gunshot wound to her head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's evidence tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was in the Army stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and was at home for the weekend.  He had been drinking at the Park.  After his aunt, Linda Faye Carroll, told him about Zeno Jones beating her up, he advised her to take out a warrant against him.  Defendant obtained the rifle from Artis for Linda Faye Carroll's protection.  He went to the Jones' residence to talk to him.  Defendant told Linda Faye Carroll there would be no shooting.  He testified that he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  took the rifle out of the car and propped it against the side of the house.  Linda Faye Carroll made the first move for the rifle, and then they became engaged in a struggle for the rifle.  The rifle fired while they were struggling, but his finger was not on the trigger.  Also, Linda Faye Carroll had her hands on the rifle when it discharged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, he contended that he was denied a fair trial because of the use of the alias could have created in the minds of the jury an implication that he was a criminal. The court ruled that defendant failed to show any prejudicial error in the alias being used. The court stated defendant's argument that the language of the bill of indictment did not identify the crime charged and was ambiguous and confusing was without merit because the two indictments, when read together, informed defendant of the crimes with which he was charged. Defendant's argument that the trial court erred in overruling his objections to leading questions asked by the state to its witnesses on direct examination was overruled because it appeared that the questions were generally within the guidelines and the ruling of the trial court were discretionary. The court did sustain defendant's assignment of error contending that the sentence of death violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court remanded the case for an imposition of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case had its inception on 12 May 1975, when the agents of the Department of Motor Vehicles (now Division of Motor Vehicles) stopped plaintiff's truck while operating on a public highway in Cumberland County.  The truck was weighed and found to be over the 4,000 pound weight limit for the license that was on the truck.  This license tag had not been purchased for this particular truck but had in fact been removed from another vehicle.  Plaintiff was assessed with (1) a license fee, $ 355.50, (2) driver education, title and transfer fees, $ 3.00, and (3) a penalty for over-licensed weight, $ 2,080.00, as provided by G.S. 20-96 and G.S. 20-118.  For unknown reasons plaintiff was given credit for being licensed for 4,000 pounds even though the license tag on its truck belonged to another vehicle.  Plaintiff paid the license fee of $ 355.50 and the driver education, title and transfer fees of $ 3.00, but refused to pay the $ 2,080.00.  The Department of Motor Vehicles gave&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  notice to plaintiff that they would use the collection procedures provision in G.S. 20-99.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereupon on 17 July 1975, plaintiff filed a complaint in Cumberland County Superior Court seeking injunctive and declaratory judgment relief.  The injunctive relief sought to prevent the use of the collection procedures provided in G.S. 20-99.  The declaratory judgment relief sought to hold General Statutes 20-91.1, 20-96 and 20-99&nbsp;unconstitutional.  On the same day plaintiff obtained </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ex parte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a temporary restraining order enjoining defendants from using the collection methods provided in G.S. 20-99 against plaintiff or plaintiff's property.  The order was extended until 6 August 1975 at which time plaintiff was granted a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 17 October 1975, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment with a supporting affidavit.  On 10 November 1975, a hearing was held pursuant to this motion, and the court found that there was no genuine issue as to a material fact and defendants should prevail as a matter of law.  The court further found that this cause was in part an action to enjoin the collection of a tax, to-wit, $ 2,080.00, and that such an action is prohibited by G.S. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  20-91.1.  The court additionally held that the cause was in part an action for declaratory judgment to hold a taxing statute unconstitutional and this action was also prohibited by G.S. 20-91.1.  Finally the court found that G.S. 20-91.1, 20-96, and 20-99 were all constitutional.  Thereupon the court dissolved the temporary injunction for that it was improvidently granted.  Other pertinent facts will be set out in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff truck driver sought review of the decision of the Cumberland County Superior Court (North Carolina), which granted defendant Department of Motor Vehicles' (department) motion for summary judgment in the truck driver's claim seeking to prevent the use of collection procedures for his failure to pay a penalty for over-licensed weight and to hold N. C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 20-91.1, 20-96 and 20-99&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The truck driver was assessed a penalty for driving a truck with more weight than the licensed allowed. The truck driver refused to pay the penalty and the department initiated collection proceedings. The truck driver filed an action seeking injunctive relief to stop the collection proceedings and declaratory relief challenging the constitutionality of N. C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 20-91.1, 20-96, and 20-99. The department filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the trial court. The truck driver appealed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by the Commissioner of Insurance from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Bailey, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 3 November 1975 Session of Wake, heard prior to determination by the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are 59 proceedings, each brought against the Commissioner of Insurance, hereinafter called the Commissioner, by one or more insurance companies, consolidated for hearing and determination in the Superior Court and upon appeal.  They fall into two groups.  The first group is composed of 25 actions for declaratory judgments in each of which the plaintiffs pray that Chapter 427 of the Session Laws of 1975, entitled &quot;An Act to Establish a Health Care Liability Reinsurance Exchange,&quot; hereinafter called the Act, presently codified as Article 18C of Chapter 58 of the General Statutes, be declared unconstitutional and void, that its enforcement against the plaintiffs be enjoined and that certain orders of the Commissioner, purporting to be entered pursuant to the provisions of such Act, be set aside.  The second group is composed of 34 proceedings, pursuant to G.S. 58-9.3, to obtain judicial review of the said orders of the Commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In yet another proceeding, the North Carolina Health Care Liability Insurance Exchange, hereinafter&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  called the Exchange, filed in the Superior Court its petition for review of the same orders of the Commissisoner.  By order of Bailey, J., it was made a party defendant to the second group of proceedings, its interest being the same as the interests of the petitioners therein, insofar as the validity of the Commissioner's orders is concerned.  The Exchange filed its brief in the Supreme Court as appellee in the second group of cases, taking no part in the appeal from the judgment entered in the first group of cases, wherein a declaratory judgment of the unconstitutionality of the Act was sought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bailey, J., entered in each group of cases a judgment in which he made voluminous and detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, substantially all of the material findings of fact being made pursuant to pre-trial stipulations, others being pursuant to testimony of and exhibits offered by witnesses for the plaintiffs concerning procedures leading to the issuance of the orders in question and the economic experience of the plaintiff companies in the writing of health care liability insurance in North Carolina under premium rates fixed by orders issued by the Commissioner.  Though he did&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not stipulate the data so shown to be correct, the Commissioner did not introduce evidence in conflict with such evidence of the plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each judgment, Bailey, J., adjudged that the Health Care Liability Reinsurance Exchange Act is unconstitutional and of no force and effect and that the Commissioner's orders in question are &quot;unlawful, invalid, and of no force and effect.&quot; He enjoined the Commissioner from suspending the licenses of the plaintiffs, or taking any other action against them, on account of any failure by them to comply with the provisions of the said Act or any rule, order or regulation issued thereunder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff insurance companies are duly licensed by the State of North Carolina to engage in the business of issuing policies of &quot;general liability insurance,&quot; as that term is defined in G.S. 58-173.37(6), which is part of the Act.  With few exceptions, none of the plaintiff companies has engaged in or desires to engage in the issuing in North Carolina of policies of health care liability insurance.  The St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company, hereinafter called St. Paul, which insures approximately 80 per cent of the doctors practicing in this State, has, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in recent years, sustained substantial losses in the writing of health care liability insurance in North Carolina under the premium rates established by orders of the Commissioner.  In recent years, both the number and the size of claims for medical malpractice have increased substantially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony of expert witnesses for the plaintiffs, which is not controverted, is to the effect that health care liability insurance, also called medical malpractice liability insurance, is a type of insurance requiring highly specialized knowledge and skill on the part of actuaries, agents and claim adjusters.  Bailey, J., so found.  He also found, there being evidence to such effect, that other plaintiff companies, if required to write such insurance in North Carolina, would probably not have a sufficient volume of such business to justify the employment by them of personnel possessed of the high degree of technical training required to carry on such business efficiently and that their present personnel is not qualified to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical malpractice insurance is unique among the various types of liability insurance in that the overwhelming majority of claims for medical malpractice are not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  filed until two or more years after the alleged malpractice occurred.  This increases the difficulty of determining what is an adequate premium to be charged for an &quot;occurrence&quot; policy; i.e., a policy insuring against liability for an &quot;occurrence&quot; in the policy year regardless of when the claim is filed.  For this reason, among others, expert witnesses for the plaintiffs testified, that, in their opinion, the writing of such insurance would be more hazardous for inexperienced companies, such as the great majority of these plaintiffs, than for experienced companies, such as St. Paul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bailey, J., found as a fact that the writing of medical malpractice insurance requires specialized training and expertise in numerous areas, including the adjustment and settling of claims, and that the nature of medical malpractice insurance is such that a company required to enter that insurance field without experience and qualified personnel &quot;could easily suffer serious losses in this line of insurance.&quot; He further found, there being evidence to that effect, that no company presently writing medical malpractice insurance voluntarily accepts all of the applications therefor tendered to it.  That is, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  there are licensed providers of health care service which such companies regard as uninsurable.  The Act here in question provides that every resident of this State holding a valid license to practice herein a health care profession is an &quot;eligible risk&quot; and any insurer is required by the Act to insure any such &quot;eligible risk,&quot; with the right in the insurer to cede (i.e., transfer the profit or loss) such business to the Exchange, which, in turn, will allocate the profits or losses to its member companies according to a prescribed formula.  Thus, losses due to the inexperience of the insurer, as well as those due to other causes, are required to be borne proportionately by all companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bailey, J., also found that the medical malpractice insurance rates prescribed by the orders of the Commissioner of which the plaintiffs complain are &quot;grossly inadequate and will require the plaintiffs to write medical malpractice insurance in North Carolina at confiscatorily low rates which will result in substantial losses to said plaintiffs&quot; and that the plan for the operation of the Exchange prescribed by the Commissioner in the said orders was not in accord with the provisions of the Act.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant is charged in separate bills of indictment with (1) rape of Tracy Lee Allen and (2) rape of Karen Davis, both offenses allegedly occurring in Caswell County on 20 August 1975.  Upon arraignment, the State announced that it would seek convictions only for second degree rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that Tracy Lee Allen and Karen Davis, both nineteen, were residents of Danville, Virginia.  On 20 August 1975 they drove to the Lantern Restaurant on Highway 68 in Caswell County, North Carolina, one or two miles from the city limits of Danville, Virginia, arriving about 9 p.m. Defendant was there when they arrived.  Both girls knew defendant on sight, having seen him at the Lantern Restaurant on several previous occasions.  When they drove into the parking lot, defendant ran to their car, said a friend had driven off with his car, and asked them to take him to get it.  The girls refused, saying they were going somewhere else.  Defendant thereupon opened the door, said &quot;slide over baby,&quot; and got in.  He told them he had a gun &quot;and asked us if that made any&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  difference.&quot; They had seen defendant with a pistol on other occasions at the Lantern Restaurant and believed he had a pistol.  So, with defendant giving directions, Tracy Lee Allen drove through Danville and south on U. S. 29 and Old 29, finally leaving the paved roads and driving down a dirt road which ended at an old house.  There defendant took the car keys and forced the girls to get out.  He took them down a path to a clearing in the woods where he tied Karen's hands behind her back, forced Tracy Lee to undress and raped her.  He told her to pray because he intended to kill the one he didn't like.  Defendant then tied Tracy Lee's hands with the same two belts he had used to bind Karen and proceeded to rape Karen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant kept the girls subjugated for more than one and one-half hours, raping each of them more than once.  He showed them scars he had received in prison fights, told them how rough life had treated him both inside and outside of jail, and said &quot;he was taking it out on us.&quot; Finally, defendant produced a pack of razor blades, said he felt guilty about what he had done, intentionally cut his own arm, and told the girls to sit and watch him die.  Eventually he permitted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  them to get dressed and all three of them returned to the car.  He allowed Tracy Lee Allen to drive.  Defendant was bleeding all over the car but refused to be taken to the hospital.  He wanted to be taken back to the Lantern Restaurant and said he would &quot;make up a story&quot; that he had a knife fight with some people behind The Drifter, and he requested the girls to corroborate him.  He said he would kill them if they told anyone what had happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They arrived at the Lantern after 11 p.m. and the girls got home after midnight.  No mention was made of the incident to anyone until the following day.  They discussed the matter with their boyfriends and then talked to Sheriff Poteat of Caswell County and obtained warrants charging defendant with rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sheriff and SBI Agent Dorsett went to the crime scene on Friday afternoon, 22 August 1975, where they found, among other things, a belt identified as belonging to defendant (S-4), an empty Gillette stainless steel razor blade package (S-6), two paper match folders (S-7), a belt buckle (S-8), a belt loop (S-9), and an earring identified by Tracy Lee Allen as belonging to her (S-10).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant did not testify as a witness in his own behalf&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but offered evidence through other witnesses.  His mother and sisters testified that defendant never wore a belt, did not own one, and that the belt identified as State's Exhibit 4 did not belong to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billy Cox testified that in a conversation with Tracy Lee Allen six days after the alleged rape, he asked her &quot;was it true about Perry Lee Tolley raping her, and she said, No, and if I heard anybody else talking about it to tell them that it wasn't true.&quot; On rebuttal, the prosecutrix Tracy Lee Allen admitted that she made the statement because she didn't want anybody to know about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury convicted defendant of second degree rape in both cases and the court imposed a life sentence in each case, to run consecutively.  Defendant appealed to the Supreme Court assigning errors discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

It had no prejudicial effect on the result of the trial and was therefore harmless. 4) Trial court's instruction concerning use of statements only for purposes of corroborating trial testimony was not a prejudicial expression of opinion by the trial judge. 5) It was necessary to leave defendant shackled during his trial, so that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion, and by failing to object, defendant waived any error with respect to his shackling.</SPAN></P>

App. 445, 219 S.E. 2d 521 (1975) (opinion by Hedrick, J., Britt, J., concurring, Martin, J., dissenting), upholding judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Albright, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 3 March 1975 Session of Forsyth Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon a warrant charging her with unlawfully and willfully operating a motor vehicle on a public street or public highway while her license was suspended, a misdemeanor under G.S. 20-28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show the following facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 4:00 a.m. on 19 October 1974 J. G. George of the State Highway Patrol observed defendant Katharine Marie Atwood enter a car and drive it on University Parkway, a public highway.  After running a license check and verifying his belief that defendant's license had been suspended, he stopped her and issued her a citation.  The State introduced defendant's driver's license record showing among other things that (1) defendant was convicted on 18 June 1974 of speeding 60 m.p.h in a 45 m.p.h. zone (occurrence date: 11 June 1974), and was convicted on 28 August 1974 of speeding 70 m.p.h. in a 55 m.p.h. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  zone (occurrence date: 1 August 1974); (2) on 23 September 1974 defendant was mailed an order to notify her of the suspension of her driving license for two offenses of speeding over 55 m.p.h., to be effective from 3 October 1974 to 2 December 1974; and (3) the suspension order was returned unclaimed on 2 October 1974.  The State's witness J. G. George testified on cross-examination that defendant told him she resided at Cedardale Lane in King, N. C., when he stopped her.  He also testified that she told him that &quot;she did not know her license was suspended and that no one had been in touch with her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order to notify defendant of the suspension stated that pursuant to G.S. 20-16(d) the Department of Motor Vehicles (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the Department&quot;) would afford defendant a hearing within 20 days after receipt of a written request.  The order also stated that defendant was not entitled to operate a motor vehicle during the period of suspension pending the hearing.  In an addendum to the record counsel stipulated that &quot;it is the established policy of the Division of Motor Vehicles [the new name for the Department effective 1 July 1975] to grant a Preliminary Hearing, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in all discretionary matters, upon request and the order of suspension or revocation is rescinded until such time as the Preliminary Hearing is conducted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's motion for dismissal at the close of the State's case was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's evidence tends to show the following facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 19 October 1974 she was driving her car on Cherry Street or University Parkway when Officer George stopped her.  The car was registered in her name.  She did not know that her license had been suspended and had received no communication that her license had been suspended.  She testified that she had an idea that she was going to lose her license but did not make any effort to check when she would lose her license since she believed she would receive notice in the mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department's records for defendant, which were part of the State's evidence, indicated that her license was issued on 1 March 1973 and her address on 23 September 1974, the date the notice of suspension was mailed, was 646 McCreay Street, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  Defendant testified that she lived at the above address before January, 1974, residing there when her license was issued.  She stated that she moved to 710&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hanes Avenue, Winston-Salem, N. C., and lived there from January, 1974 until she moved to Cedardale Lane, King, N. C., at the end of August 1974.  She continued to live at King until the time of the trial.  She testified that she filled out a change of address card when she moved to Hanes Avenue and mailed it to the Post Office.  She received one forwarded letter at Hanes Avenue.  When she moved in August to King, she again filled out a change of address card and mailed it to the Post Office.  She stated that she did not receive much mail and had received no mail forwarded to her King address.  She never sent a change of address notice to the Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and defendant was sentenced to thirty (30) days of imprisonment suspended for two years on payment of a fine of $ 200.00 and costs.  Defendant appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon a bill of indictment, proper in form, charging him with the first degree murder of William B. Turner, Sr., on 6 January 1975 in Lenoir County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that defendant and two accomplices named Randolph Jackson Freeman and Jessie Ray Harris met at a trailer in Kinston on the late afternoon of 6 January 1975 and agreed &quot;to go to the country to get some money . . . by armed robbery.&quot; With Freeman driving, the three men rode into the country looking for stores they could rob.  They were armed with a .22 caliber pistol and a sawedoff shotgun, both furnished by defendant.  When they arrived at the first grocery store it was closed.  They drove on to a second store but, observing many cars and people there, decided it was too crowded to rob.  They returned to Kinston and rode around looking for someone to rob.  On Willow Street they saw a man leave a house and enter a white Ford.  Defendant said he might be an insurance man and told the driver to follow him.  They followed the &quot;insurance man&quot; down Willow Street.  When he stopped at a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trailer home and entered, defendant and Jessie Ray Harris left the car and told Randolph Freeman to wait for them around the corner.  Defendant at that time was armed with the sawed-off shotgun and Jessie Ray Harris with the .22 caliber pistol.  Defendant and Harris put some black silk cloth over their faces and waited until the &quot;insurance man&quot; came out.  In about three minutes he left the trailer and started for his car.  The two robbers converged upon him as defendant leveled the shotgun at the man.  The victim started &quot;to go in his pocket for his gun&quot; and defendant shot him in the chest with the sawed-off .410 shotgun.  The two robbers then fled and were picked up by Randolph Freeman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foregoing is a brief summary of the testimony of Randolph Freeman and Jessie Ray Harris, both of whom pled guilty to second degree murder and conspiracy to commit armed robbery and testified for the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;insurance man&quot; was later identified as William B. Turner, Sr.  At the time he was shot he was making his rounds, collecting insurance premiums.  He made his way to a nearby house and sought help.  An ambulance was called and Mr. Turner was taken to Lenoir Memorial Hospital in Kinston. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was suffering from shotgun wounds in the chest and died on 27 January 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Sylvanus W. Nye, an expert in the field of pathology, performed an autopsy upon the body.  Wounds on the left chest were spread over an area of 12 to 13 inches, scattered in a random pattern.  Pellets were found in the wounds beneath the skin and in the muscles of the chest wall.  The lung was torn so that air leaked into the space between the lung and the chest wall.  In the course of medical treatment a tube had been inserted by the surgeon into the chest cavity to evacuate air that had collected there.  The right lung was fully expanded but the left lung was partially collapsed due to air leakage where a pellet had torn the lung.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Turner had been treated with sulfa drugs, including a drug called gantrisin which had been administered the day before he died.  It was Dr. Nye's opinion that Mr. Turner had a hypersensitivity to gantrisin and developed myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart which can be fatal.  Dr. Nye testified: &quot;The man had chronic lung disease.  The injury to his lungs had caused a severe infection.  He was still producing purulent sputum and they needed another antibiotic agent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to try to control the chronic infection in his lung.&quot; In the opinion of Dr. Nye, that was the reason gantrisin was administered to Mr. Turner.  When asked to state his opinion as to the cause of death, Dr. Nye said: &quot;The inflammation of his heart was the immediate cause of his death.  I would say the immediate cause of his death was a natural and direct result of the gunshot wound he sustained on January 6, 1975.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered no evidence.  The jury convicted him of murder in the first degree, and he was sentenced to death.  He appealed to the Supreme Court and assigns errors discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant moved to quash the bill of indictment on the ground that the death penalty of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17 was unconstitutional. He also contended that the trial court erred in admitting clothing worn by the victim into evidence, and that the evidence failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim's death was proximately caused by the shotgun fired into his chest by defendant. The court affirmed and found that the constitutionality of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17 had been upheld by the court, and did not constitute cruel and usual punishment. The court further held that the fact that that photographs of articles of clothing worn by the deceased on the night that he was shot had been previously offered in evidence did not make the clothing itself inadmissible, and the clothing was relevant and shed light upon the extent of the bleeding and the seriousness of the wounds suffered by the deceased. The court also determined that although the victim's death was directly caused by a reaction to medication, it was still proximately caused by the gunshot from defendant because the reason that the victim was treated with the medication was as a result of the gunshot.</SPAN></P>

After the judge had adjourned court for the day, he was approached by defendant's lawyer, and the judge had the clerk file an entry of prayer for judgment continued for six months.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was indicted in separate bills for murder and conspiracy.  The first bill charges that on 24 January 1975 defendant feloniously, willfully, and of his malice aforethought, did kill and murder Lindsey Winfred Hall in Stokes County.  The second bill charges that on 24 January 1975 defendant unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously conspired with Harold Linwood Jordan and William Brady Tilley to feloniously assault and inflict serious injury upon Lindsey Winfred Hall with firearms.  The cases were tried together without objection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that on 24 January 1975 James Vernon Smith, Brady Tilley, Willa Dean Hicks and Gail Bullins were drinking together at defendant's trailer in Stokes County.  In the late afternoon they were joined by Larry Hodges, Harold Jordan and Lindsey Winfred Hall.  Between 5:30 and 7:00 p.m. Willa Dean Hicks was taken home and was replaced by Julia Pruitt.  Around 9 p.m. Larry Hodges went to bed with Gail Bullins in the back bedroom of defendant's trailer.  Harold Jordan and Brady Tilley took Lindsey Winfred Hall home around 10:30&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  p.m. in Jordan's truck.  Mrs. Hall heard the truck arrive, recognized it by its sound, and heard loud voices outside her trailer home.  After the truck left Lindsey Winfred Hall entered his trailer home and told his wife that Harold Jordan wouldn't be coming there anymore.  When Mrs. Hall asked why, he replied, &quot;Didn't you hear us fighting?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence further tends to show that when Brady Tilley and Harold Jordan returned to defendant's trailer after taking Winfred Hall home, defendant James Vernon Smith went into the room where Larry Hodges and Gail Bullins were sleeping and asked to borrow Hodges' car.  Hodges gave his keys to defendant and cautioned him not to wreck the car.  The defendant, Harold Jordan and Brady Tilley thereupon left the trailer and at that time defendant had a .25 automatic pistol in his belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larry Hodges' car was white and had a stripe down the side.  Around 11:30 p.m. Mrs. Winfred Hall, who had not yet retired, observed car lights coming into the driveway of her trailer home.  She observed that the car was white and appeared to have a stripe down the side.  Someone blew the horn, &quot;and it was a real funny sounding horn.&quot; She could not hear anything&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that was being said outside, but &quot;it sounded like somebody was just barely in a whisper talking and a trunk lid slammed.  . . . It was mumbled-like voices in a whisper.  . . .  I could not tell how many people were there.&quot; When the horn was blown a second time, she awakened her husband and told him someone was outside.  Lindsey Winfred Hall got up, looked outside, seemed to grow frightened, finally pulled on his pants and went outside.  As he passed through the door Mrs. Hall heard the car backing out of the driveway and heard three shots.  One bullet penetrated the wall in the bedroom where she was sitting.  She immediately ran outside and found her husband lying on his back at the end of the driveway.  When she reached him he said, &quot;They shot me.&quot; He was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead on arrival.  An autopsy revealed that death was caused by multiple gunshot wounds, apparently as a result of buckshot from a shotgun blast to the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant James Vernon Smith, Harold Jordan and Brady Tilley returned to defendant's trailer &quot;somewhere around 11:30 p.m.&quot; Defendant asked Julia Pruitt to drive him to his father's house, which she did.  There, he concealed a shotgun under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the mattress of a bed.  The following day, 25 January 1975, defendant learned that Brady Tilley had been arrested, whereupon he told Larry Hodges to inspect his car for shells.  Hodges did so but found none.  Defendant also told Hodges to &quot;keep quite about it.&quot; Later in the day defendant gave the .25 automatic pistol to Julia Pruitt and told her to take it home.  She took it to her home and concealed it in a closet.  She saw defendant again on the night of 27 January 1975, and defendant wanted to know what she had told the investigating SBI agent.  He warned her that the same thing that happened to Winfred Hall could happen to her if she said anything.  Julia next saw defendant on 30 January 1975 when he told her to get rid of the .25 automatic pistol.  She wrapped it in a paper bag and threw it in some bushes behind her home.  Some weeks later she told SBI Agent Johnson about the pistol and, acting on the information she furnished, Agent Johnson recovered it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Larry Hodges vehicle, a white car with a stripe down the side, was driven to Mrs. Hall's trailer and the horn was blown.  Mrs. Hall testified that the horn sounded like the one she heard the night her husband was killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two shell casings were found on the ground near the Hall trailer.  Markings on these shell casings were compared with the markings of the shells which had been test-fired in defendant's .25 automatic pistol.  Based on similarity of the markings, SBI Agent Hurst testified that in his opinion the two shell casings found near the Hall trailer had been fired by defendant's .25 automatic pistol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Smith offered no evidence.  Harold Jordan and Brady Tilley were granted separate trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury convicted defendant of (1) murder in the first degree and (2) conspiracy to commit a felonious assault with a firearm upon Lindsey Winfred Hall.  He was sentenced to death for the murder and to imprisonment for ten years for the conspiracy.  He appealed to the Supreme Court alleging errors discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charges against defendant stemmed from the shooting death of a victim outside of his trailer home. Two alleged co-conspirators were tried separately. Defendant was sentenced to death for the murder and to imprisonment for 10 years for the conspiracy. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that the trial court's excusal of 27 prospective jurors without a formal challenge for cause by the state did not constitute prejudicial error. The court found that the trial court was seeking to expedite the selection of the jury and defendant did not object to the empaneling procedure. The court also found no prejudicial error in the trial court's exclusion of five prospective jurors by reason of their general opposition to capital punishment. The court further held that there was sufficient evidence of defendant's premeditation and deliberation to submit the charge of first-degree murder to the jury. The court found that the evidence gave rise to inferences that defendant accompanied the co-conspirators to the victim's home, enticed the victim to come outside, and then without warning opened fire upon him with a shotgun and defendant's automatic pistol.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On indictment, proper in form, defendant was charged with the murder of Herman Capel.  He entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree and death sentence was imposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State tended to show the following: About 9:00 a.m. on 21 May 1975, several employees of a store operated by Herman Capel, and others who were in the store, saw defendant walking back and forth in front of the store before entering.  After he entered, they heard a loud &quot;pop,&quot; saw Mr. Capel fall, and saw defendant walk out of the store with a gun in his hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Tommy Allen of the Wadesboro Police Department was immediately called to the store where he found Mr. Capel dead, with a gunshot wound in the head.  An autopsy revealed that Mr. Capel died as a result of this wound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Detective Allen arrived at the police station around 10:00 a.m. on 21 May, he found defendant, who had voluntarily surrendered, waiting for him.  After being fully advised of his rights, defendant was asked&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by Allen if he understood these rights or had any questions.  Defendant said he had no questions, that he understood his rights, and that he did not want a lawyer.  He then told Allen that about a month earlier he had a &quot;run-in&quot; with Mr. Capel about two cans of pepper that he had put in his pocket and for which Mr. Capel had accused him of not paying.  He said he then paid Mr. Capel for the pepper and left the store.  Defendant further stated to Allen that about a week before the shooting he overheard people talking about how Mr. Capel had caught him stealing pepper from the store, and as a result he went to see Mr. Capel and talked to him about these conversations.  Mr. Capel stated that he had not told anyone about the pepper incident.  Defendant told Allen, however, that this incident continued to bother him, and that he had gone to Mr. Capel's store on 21 May to talk with him but that Mr. Capel had not arrived.  He left and returned about an hour later, at which time he entered the store with the gun in his hand.  He saw Mr. Capel on the right side of the store talking to a man, walked straight over to where Mr. Capel was standing, stuck the gun up to the back of his head and shot&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  him one time.  He then left the store, taking the gun with him.  He told Detective Allen that he had thrown the gun out on the side of the road on 109 North and agreed to take Allen to find it.  As they were leaving the station, he told Allen that the gun was not on the side of the road but was at his house.  They then went to Mr. Hammond's house and at defendant's request his wife gave the gun to Allen.</SPAN></P>

He appealed and the court ordered a new trial. Defendant contended that the effect of the district attorney's remarks about defendant's possible return to the community was so prejudicial that the instruction given by the trial court did not suffice, and that the trial court at that time should have gone further and explained to the jury what would happen to defendant if acquitted by reason of insanity. Having failed to do this, defendant further contended the trial court should have given the instruction proposed by defendant. The court agreed. The judge's instruction to the jury to disregard the remark was insufficient to overcome the idea planted in the minds of the jurors that if defendant were found not guilty he would return to the community, perhaps to kill again. Had the jury been informed by the trial judge that if they returned a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity that defendant would be treated as provided by law in such cases, the jury might well have been more inclined to return a verdict of not guilty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by Arcadia Dairy Farms, Inc., from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McKinnon, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 16 June 1975 Session of Wake, heard prior to determination by the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arcadia Dairy Farms, Inc. (hereinafter called Arcadia), is a producer and a distributor of fluid milk in Marketing Area No. 8 in North Carolina (Asheville and vicinity).  The North Carolina Milk Commission (hereinafter called the Commission) is an agency of the State, created by and having the authority conferred upon it by Article 28B of Chapter 106 of the General Statutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On or about 10 April 1974, the Commission, following a public hearing, adopted Amendment No. 27 to its Milk Marketing Order No. 2.  Arcadia filed its petition for a judicial review thereof by the Superior Court of Wake County.  Arcadia sought and obtained from the Superior Court an order restraining the enforcement of the amendment by the Commission until the hearing of the matter in the Superior Court.  It alleged Amendment No. 27 is in excess of the statutory authority of the Commission and, if not, the statute authorizing the Commission to promulgate the amendment is unconstitutional and void for that: (1) It is an unlawful delegation of legislative power&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the Commission since it fails to establish adequate standards for the guidance of the Commission; (2) it constitutes an unlawful burden upon interstate commerce, in violation of the Constitution of the United States, Article I, Sec. 8, Clause 3; (3) it is confiscatory and levies a tax not enacted by the General Assembly, in violation of the Constitution of North Carolina, Article I, Sec. 8; and (4) it is in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and of Article I, Sec. 19, of the Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Superior Court, after hearing, concluded the action of the Commission in promulgating the said amendment is not in violation of constitutional provisions, is within the statutory authority and jurisdiction of the Commission, was made upon lawful procedure, is not affected by other error of law, is supported by competent, material and substantial evidence, in view of the entire record as submitted, and is not arbitrary or capricious.  The Superior Court, therefore, adjudged that the decision of the Commission adopting the amendment be affirmed, vacated the interlocutory stay order and directed the payment to the Commission of funds&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  deposited by Arcadia and held in escrow pending the adjudication of this matter.  By consent of the parties, the judgment of the Superior Court was stayed pending the determination of this appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing in the record indicates that any fluid milk sold or distributed by Arcadia is not wholesome, falls short of the highest standards of purity established by law for the types of milk it purports to be, is in any way misrepresented to the consumer as to content and quality, or is, in any respect, lower in quality than the purportedly comparable product of any of the other five distributors of fluid milk in the Asheville area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The designations &quot;Class I&quot; and &quot;Class II&quot; hereinafter referred to, do not relate to the quality of the fluid milk but such classification is determined solely by the use made by the distributor (the processor) of fluid milk received from the producer (the dairy farmer) and determines the price paid by the distributor, at the end of each payment period, to the producer for the fluid milk received from the producer by the distributor.  This classification of milk (to be distinguished from the grading of milk by the Department of Agriculture pursuant to G.S. 106-267) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was not established by statute, but by the regulation of the Commission.  With refinements and exceptions not here material, the Commission's Milk Marketing Order #2 defines Class I milk to include all fluid milk and fluid milk products &quot;sold or disposed of for consumption or use as processed fluid milk products&quot; and specifically includes &quot;reconstituted milk.&quot; Class IA milk includes all bulk milk sold to other distributors, milk transferred between branches of the same distributors for use as fluid milk and milk sold directly to military installations.  Class II milk is all other milk </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">received</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the distributor.  That is, Class II milk includes milk used by the distributor or sold by it for use in the production of butter, cheese, milk powder and other non-fluid milk products.  With reference to the demand for milk for use as fluid milk, it is surplus milk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Records are kept by the distributor showing its use of all milk received by it during a payment period, and at the end of such period the distributor makes payment to the producer for all milk delivered by the producer to the distributor during such payment period, the payment for Class I milk being at a higher rate than the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  payment for Class II milk.  Records are not kept by the distributor to show the use so made of milk purchased from each individual producer, the classification for payment purposes of each producer's milk being in the same proportion as the classification of the total volume received by the distributor during the payment period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arcadia is a producer.  That is, it has its own dairy herd, all of the milk derived from which is distributed by Arcadia.  (The record in Case No. 18, a companion case decided this day, indicates that the herd is actually owned by individuals, or an individual, who own or owns all of the stock of Arcadia, but, for the purpose of this litigation, Arcadia has been regarded and is deemed to be the owner of the dairy herd and, therefore, a producer-distributor.) Arcadia distributes in the Asheville area fluid milk for consumption for use as such.  Its total distribution amounts to approximately six per cent of the total fluid milk sales in that area, there being five other distributors in the Asheville area and Arcadia being, apparently, the smallest.  Approximately half of the fluid milk so distributed by Arcadia is &quot;reconstituted milk,&quot; processed by Arcadia. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is a low fat milk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arcadia's reconstituting process is substantially as follows: It purchases from a supplier in Wisconsin (now a supplier in Tennessee according to the record in Case No. 18) milk powder produced from fluid milk (Grade A milk, apparently).  This it mixes with water, obtained from Arcadia's private well, and other milk solids to give the resulting fluid the desired butterfat content, palatability and other nutritious qualities.  It then mixes that fluid with an equal amount of whole, natural milk (Class I).  The end product is then packaged and sold for consumption or other use as fluid milk.  Thus, the end product (one-half of Arcadia's total distribution, approximately three per cent of the total distribution in the Asheville area) constitutes fluid milk which, itself, is composed of 50 per cent Class I milk and 50 per cent Class II milk, the latter portion being composed of the milk powder purchased out of State, the other milk solids and the water from Arcadia's well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amendment No. 27 to Milk Marketing Order No. 2, the regulation here in question, provides:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;To protect the stability of the supply of producer milk, no Class I or Class IA milk shall be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  purchased, received, handled, or obtained from any source other than from approved producers or other North Carolina licensed distributors without the express permission of the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;If a distributor reconstitutes milk for Class I sales, such distributor shall pay into an equalization fund an amount equal to the difference between the price of Class I and Class II milk.  * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;The amount due to the equalization fund shall be determined and paid each month to the Commission.  The amount collected shall be distributed in accordance with a procedure approved by the Commission </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">for payment to the producers selling to other distributors</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> within the market area * * *.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to this amendment, the Commission has ordered Arcadia to make payments, substantial in amount, to its &quot;equalization fund.&quot; Pending the determination of this proceeding, these payments have, by consent, been paid into a fund held in escrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence at the hearing before the Commission was to the effect that at the time Arcadia processed and distributed such &quot;reconstituted milk,&quot; there was available in the Asheville area natural, fluid milk which it could have purchased from its competitor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  distributors, or, perhaps, directly from producers.  Had it done so, the producers of such milk would have received from the distributors supplied by them payment for their milk at Class I rates.  Since Arcadia did not purchase and use such milk, but used Wisconsin powder plus Arcadia's water to produce &quot;reconstituted milk&quot; for sale to its customers, the milk so left in the hands of Arcadia's competitor distributors became, to them, surplus milk and was used or sold by them for Class II purposes and, consequently, the producers of such milk received therefor, from the distributors suplied by them, payment at the Class II rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effect of the Commission's order is that Arcadia must pay to the Commission the difference between the Class I price and the Class II price on its total volume of &quot;reconstituted&quot; milk less the portion thereof which, itself, consists of natural, fluid milk.  That is, Arcadia is ordered to pay to the Commission the difference between the Class I price and the Class II price per volume unit multiplied by the volume of Wisconsin powder plus Arcadia's water.  Payments so made by Arcadia to the Commission will be distributed by the Commission to those producers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  who delivered their milk, not to Arcadia but to Arcadia's competing distributors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one in North Carolina manufactures the milk powder used by Arcadia in its processing of reconstituted milk.  Arcadia is the only distributor of such milk in the Asheville area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence at the hearing conducted by the Commission included the following testimony by proponents of the adoption of the amendment in question:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;We have a real problem in Western North Carolina in that one processor, by recombining milk powder and water, is taking our Class I sales in the marketplace.  * * * We found that if the prices were set after studying the matter through the Milk Commission staff that the reconstituted products would probably take a lower price than the whole milk from the cow, which wouldn't solve our problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;[T]here has been and still is a surplus of raw milk in this Asheville Market since November of 1973.  Biltmore [a distributor] has experienced a surplus, and it is my understanding that the other distributors in the area, Pet, Sealtest, and Dairymen, Inc., have likewise had a surplus of milk.  There has been no contact whatever with Biltmore or any of its representatives by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  representatives of Arcadia Dairies during this period seeking raw milk * * *.  With regard to the distributors they are plainly and clearly unable to compete with this product under the present status of the regulations.  They cannot sell below cost.  They cannot market their product, this product, recombined milk, without paying full Class I price for it, and, in addition, the cost of the powder itself.  * * * They [Arcadia] are selling it, having a cost of the raw product at Class II prices.  * * * [W]e cannot in good conscience recommend that the Commission, instead of this amendment, relax their regulations on marketing of combined milk and allow all other distributors to compete.  I believe that would aggravate the problem instead of solving it.  As distributors, I submit we must be allowed to either have a corrective measure in the form of this amendment as proposed, or by relaxing the requirements of our having to [pay] Class I prices for recombined milk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Our [North Carolina] dairy farmers cannot economically compete with milk powder and continue to produce fresh and wholesome fluid milk.  Our farmers must receive the Class I price for a majority of their production&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  to even have a chance of surviving.  They can compete with fluid milk from the mid-west area, the area which produces most of the dry milk powder available for commercial trade.  The March, 1974, Federal Order Minimum Class I price in the Minneapolis-St.  Paul market is $ 9.16 per hundredweight.  Any distributor in the Asheville area receiving this fluid milk from the mid-west could expect to pay at least $ 2.50 per hundredweight for handling and transportation charges, making his total cost approximately $ 11.66 per hundredweight or at least $ 1.00 more than the current Class I price in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;However, surplus milk in the mid-west used for manufacturing dry milk powder is purchased by mid-west plants for about $ 8.00 per hundredweight, which includes the commercial components of butterfat and non-fat milk solids.  This simply means that dry milk powder delivered to processors in Asheville does not bear the high transportation costs for the fluid components that have been removed and does reflect the lower prices paid mid-west farmers for their surplus milk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;A North Carolina distributor who reconstitutes fluid volume from milk powder and water has an ingredient cost of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  approximately $ 5.33 per hundredweight for milk solids -- non-fat.  This is computed on $ .65 per pound cost for powder with 8.2 pounds of powder per hundredweight of fluid volume.  The $ 5.33 cost does not include the cost of water and labor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;A North Carolina processor and distributor with a full supply of local producer milk is required to pay his dairy farmers $ 10.62 per hundredweight for Class I milk.  When a distributor removes the fat to obtain a fluid skim product, the fat value is computed at 3.5 pounds at $ .70 per pound to be $ 2.45.  Therefore, $ 10.62 less $ 2.45 equals $ 8.17 as the fluid skim value and this does not include plant costs of separation and processing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;At the very minimum, this reflects a raw product cost advantage of $ 2.84 per hundredweight or $ .245 per gallon to a distributor who elects to deliberately not buy locally produced milk, but to use milk powder to reconstitute fluid volume for consumer sales.  * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;To go a step further, if Arcadia Dairy is allowed to continue with its raw product cost advantage, no doubt every processor in the State will quickly go in this direction.  During the month of January, 1974, there were 5,157,000 pounds of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  low-fat product sold in North Carolina.  If one-half of this sales volume is lost to the powder reconstitution method, this would cost North Carolina Grade A dairy farmers $ 87,669 per month.  (2,578,500 pounds X $ 3.40 per hundredweight.) * * * The only alternative is higher class prices for their product.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence introduced before the Commission by the opponents of the amendment included the following testimony:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;The effect of this amendment would be to increase the cost of reconstituted milk by 15 cents to 25 cents per gallon.  * * * What we [the North Carolina Consumer Council] are saying * * * is that the consumer should be allowed the freedom of choice, whether it's a less expensive reconstituted product versus a more expensive whole milk product, or if Mrs. Housewife so desires, to buy her own powder and mix it herself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Arcadia puts out, I believe, somewhere in the neighborhood of 30,000 gallons of milk of one sort or the other per month.  Now, 15,000 of this is fresh whole milk.  Now, this should have no effect on the market up there.  If he has 5% of the market, which we question somewhat -- it was close to 4% -- but whatever the percentage, it's small&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  -- then when you talk about reconstituted milk you are talking about approximately 2% of that market, and as I understand, the reconstituted milk in itself consists of approximately 50% whole milk.  So you see we are talking about just a very small amount compared with the total market in the actual area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Now, there is no question but what this reconstituted milk apparently serves a need because otherwise these housewives would be going straight to the shelf and making their own.  But they can't put that together with the palatability that their children will drink.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission's Milk Marketing Order No. 2 prescribes regulations pursuant to which a producer establishes his milk base in a marketing area.  The order further provides that a producer who has established a base in any marketing area shall be entitled to continue to ship all his milk to the distributor with whom his base is established.  The producer may transfer his base to another producer.  The producer may also transfer his business from one distributor to another.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant dairy farm sought review of a decision of the Superior Court (North Carolina), which affirmed the decision of appellee North Carolina Milk Commission to adopt an amendment, vacated the interlocutory stay order and directed payment to the commission of funds that the dairy farm held in escrow pending adjudication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission adopted an amendment to a milk marketing order which required one who purchased, from within or without of the state, powdered milk, mixed it with water, thereby reconstituting fluid milk, which he distributed to consumers in the state, to pay the state producers of natural, fluid milk, from which producers he purchased nothing and with which producer he had no business dealing. The dairy farm filed a petition contending that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 106-266.8 did not authorize the commission to require such payment. The trial court affirmed the decision of the commission to adopt the amendment. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that there was nothing in &sect; 106.266.8 that indicated legislative intent to empower the commission to afford to other producer's greater protection against competition from wholesome reconstituted milk. Further, conferring the commission with power to require a distributor of reconstituted milk to make such payments for the benefit of producers, with whom it had no dealings, could give rise to serious doubt as to whether such action violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, regarding deprivation of property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court, which affirmed the decision of the commission to adopt the amendment in question, and which had also vacated the interlocutory stay order and directed payment to the commission of funds that the dairy farm held in escrow pending adjudication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal under G.S. 7A-30(2) from the decision of the Court of Appeals reported in 23 N.C. App. 423, 209 S.E. 2d 336 (1974), which affirmed an order of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Ervin, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, denying defendants' motion to dismiss and to change venue, entered at the 20 October 1973 Session of Burke Superior Court, docketed and argued as Case No. 61 at the Spring Term 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, C. Capers Smith, a medical doctor, with approved training and experience in psychiatry and duly licensed in North Carolina, instituted this action on 24 July 1973 against the State of North Carolina and the following State officers in their official and individual capacity: James E. Holshouser, the present Governor of North Carolina; Joe K. Byrd, Chairman of the State Board of Mental Health; Ralph Scott, legislative member of the Advisory Budget Commission; David Flaherty, Secretary of the Department of Human Resources; N. P. Zarzar, State Commissioner of Mental Health; and Dr. Trevor G. Williams, Acting Superintendent of Broughton Hospital and former Western Regional Commissioner of Mental Health.  Plaintiff alleges that he is entitled to recover damages against both the State and the individual defendants for his wrongful discharge&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as Superintendent of Broughton Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In summary the complaint alleges (enumeration ours):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On or about 1 October 1970 Governor Robert W. Scott, who was then Governor of the State, confirmed plaintiff's appointment as Superintendent of Broughton Hospital, one of the State's hospitals for the mentally disordered.  The appointment made in accordance with G.S. &sect; 122-25 (1964) (repealed 1 July 1973 by N. C. Sess. Laws, Ch. 476, &sect; 133 (1973)), was for a term of six years.  Plaintiff accepted the appointment and performed his duties as superintendent &quot;properly, efficiently and according to the contract&quot; until 18 April 1973, when he was discharged without cause and without a hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. On 18 April 1973 Dr. Trevor Williams, Western Regional Commissioner of Mental Health, demanded that plaintiff release to him &quot;the tape recorder cassettes&quot; allegedly made during an official credentials committee meeting called by plaintiff as superintendent of Broughton Hospital.  Plaintiff, at that time, did not have the cassettes and therefore could not release them to Dr. Williams.  Notwithstanding, because of his failure to produce the tapes, Dr. Williams summarily discharged plaintiff from his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  position although plaintiff's contract with the State gave him three years and five months additional employment.  Plaintiff's removal as superintendent was thereafter approved by Dr. N. P. Zarzar, State Commissioner of Mental Health; David Flaherty, Secretary of the Department of Human Resources; and Governor Holshouser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiff's dismissal was &quot;without due cause or authority&quot;; &quot;against the statute&quot;; &quot;without any hearing whatsoever and without due process.&quot; He was dismissed &quot;in a manner of harassment, embarrassment, with widely publicized news coverage and under circumstances designed to embarrass and humiliate plaintiff.&quot; Defendants' actions deprived plaintiff &quot;of his livelihood and right to employment&quot; and &quot;resulted in his professional defamation.&quot; Plaintiff's age and the prejudicial circumstances under which he was released will render it difficult if not impossible for him to obtain other employment of a comparable nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. After his dismissal, plaintiff, pursuant to G.S. 122-1.1 (1964) (repealed 1 July 1973 by N. C. Sess. Laws, Ch. 476, &sect; 133 (1973)), served upon the Governor and the Chairman of the Advisory Budget Commission a claim for severance pay.  When no action&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was taken on his claim, plaintiff filed this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff's prayer for relief is that he recover from &quot;the defendants jointly and severally&quot; the amount of $ 250,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 21 August 1973 all defendants except Joe K. Byrd, pursuant to G.S. &sect; 1A-1, Rule 12(b), moved to dismiss the action on the grounds that sovereign immunity barred the suit against the State and against the individual defendants since they were acting in their official capacities.  In the event the motion to dismiss was denied, pursuant to G.S. &sect; 1-77 and G.S. &sect; 1-83(2), defendants moved to change the venue from Burke County to Wake County on the grounds (1) the discharge occurred in Wake and, the action being against public officers, the case properly should be tried in Wake; and (2) the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by removing the case to Wake County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Joe K. Byrd filed a separate answer, affidavit, and response to the motion to dismiss in which he opposed the two motions made by the other defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 20 October 1973 Judge Ervin denied the motions to dismiss and to change the venue.  The moving defendants' petition for certiorari to the North Carolina Court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Appeals was allowed 16 November 1973.  The Court of Appeals, Judge Baley dissenting, affirmed the trial judge's rulings, and the moving defendants appealed to this Court as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 21 May 1975 a petition was filed in Forsyth County District Court by Gerald M. Thornton, Director, Forsyth County Department of Social Services, requesting that the court enter an order authorizing the sterilization of Joseph Lee Moore, a minor.  The petition was accompanied by the consent of the respondent, Joseph Lee Moore, and his mother, Dora I. Moore.  A psychological report included in the petition indicated that Joseph is presently functioning at a moderately retarded level of measured intelligence, with a Full Scale I.Q. of under 40 and a Test Age score of 8.  The petitioner believed Joseph to be a proper subject for sterilization because it is likely that unless sterilized he would procreate a child or children who would probably have serious physical, mental or nervous diseases or deficiencies.  The accompanying statement by the examining physician, Dr. Ruth O'Neal, found no known contraindication to the requested surgical procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent, through his guardian ad litem and attorney, in apt time objected&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the petition and requested a hearing.  This matter was heard on 29 July 1975 before A. Lincoln Sherk, J., in Forsyth District Court, Juvenile Division.  The respondent filed a motion to quash and dismiss the petition, alleging that G.S. 35-36, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, was unconstitutional.  This motion was allowed and notice of appeal was given by the State to Forsyth Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter was heard </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before McConnell, J., at the 28 July 1975 Civil Session of Forsyth Superior Court.  The respondent again made his motions to quash or dismiss the petition.  Judge McConnell allowed the motion, finding G.S. 35-36 through G.S. 35-50, inclusive, unconstitutional.  The District Attorney for the Twenty-First Judicial District excepted to the judgment and for the State gave notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals.  The respondent petitioned the Supreme Court to hear this matter prior to determination by the Court of Appeals.  This petition was allowed on 27 August 1975.  </SPAN></P>

The examining physician found no known contraindication to surgical sterilization, and the minor's mother had consented to the performance of a vasectomy. The minor, through his guardian ad litem and attorney, objected to the petition for sterilization, alleging that the statute authorizing the procedure, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 35-36 et seq., was unconstitutional. The court preempted review by the court of appeals and held that: (1) the statute did not violate procedural due process, as it provided for the same notice and hearing to all persons subject to the statute; (2) the statute did not violate substantive due process, as the state had a compelling interest in preventing the procreation of children who would become a burden on the state; (3) the statute complied with the equal protection clause because it did not distinguish between classes of mentally ill or mentally retarded persons; (4) the statute was not unconstitutionally vague; and (5) the cruel and unusual punishment clause was not implicated because it was not a criminal proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Plaintiff appealed from judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Lee, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 1 April 1975 Civil Session, Wake Superior Court.  After the record on appeal was duly docketed in the Court of Appeals, we allowed certiorari and the case was certified to this Court for initial appellate review prior to determination by the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was tried before Judge Lee without a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff is engaged in the sale of food and food products, including canned frozen concentrated orange juice, to restaurants, hospitals, schools, and other commercial customers.  These customers are not soft drink bottlers but are engaged in the preparation of food and drink which is served to their customers and patrons.  Plaintiff failed to pay taxes found by defendant to be due on the frozen concentrated orange juice.  Following an audit, defendant made an assessment against plaintiff for $ 1,119.98 which plaintiff paid under protest and brought this action to recover same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence offered by plaintiff -- defendant offered none -- consists of the stipulations of the parties, including the stipulated testimony of the witness W. W. Brown which is set out in the record as Exhibit A and narrated in the paragraphs which follow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  W. W. Brown is Vice President of Lykes Pasco Packing Company in Dade City, Florida, operator of the largest citrus processing plant in the world and producer of frozen concentrated orange juice which is sold in North Carolina.  Some of its frozen concentrated orange juice is packed in institutional size containers and distributed in North Carolina by the plaintiff in this case.  Mr. Brown is a graduate of the University of Tennessee with a major in bacteriology and a minor in chemistry.  He has had five years experience in research and development in the area of food technology with the Minute Maid Company and nineteen years experience in quality control and research and development in the citrus industry.  He is a member of the Institute of Food Technologists and of the Association of Food and Drug Officials.  Over the years he has participated in numerous professional seminars, conferences, and short courses related to food technology, the processing of juices, or fabrication of drinks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown testified that fruit juice is the natural juice extracted from fruit; and concentrated fruit juice, such as frozen concentrated orange juice, is the natural juice extracted from fruit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from which a substantial portion of the water has been removed.  Fruit juice is a natural substance to which nothing has been added, and concentrated fruit juice is the result of extraction of water from that natural substance.  Concentrated fruit juice is not fabricated or manufactured from a number of ingredients.  In the case of frozen concentrated orange juice, approximately three-fourths of the water is removed to reduce the cost and increase the convenience of storage and shipment.  The proper amount of water restored prior to consumption does not result in a product more diluted than the orange juice.  Rather, it brings the concentrated juice back to the full strength of natural fruit juice.  From the standpoint of restoration, flavoring and chemistry, the juice which results when the water is restored to frozen concentrated orange juice is substantially identical to that of the original juice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruit juice drinks, and concentrates for fruit juice drinks, are fabricated drinks which are only partially composed of a fruit juice concentrate.  They are not natural fruit juices.  They are not a single natural substance.  They are drinks fabricated or manufactured from a number of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ingredients.  Unlike natural fruit juice, their fruit juice content is highly diluted so that when consumed the strength of its fruit juice ingredient is only a fraction of that of natural fruit juice.  Ingredients of concentrates for fruit juice drinks include substantial quantities of water, sugar, syrup, natural flavoring, acidifiers, buffers, stabilizers and emulsifiers and often include coloring, artificial flavoring, and preservatives.  When restaurants or other institutional establishments desire to serve a fruit juice drink they do not attempt to prepare it by mixing frozen concentrated orange juice and the many other necessary ingredients.  Rather, they turn to a manufacturer from whom they purchase a prepared concentrate for fruit juice drink containing all of the ingredients in the correct proportions and chemical balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After considering the testimony of W. W. Brown and the pretrial stipulations, Judge Lee made findings of fact which track verbatim the stipulations of the parties.  Those findings, and conclusions of law based thereon, appear in the following judgment rendered by Judge Lee:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;1. The plaintiff is a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  of the laws of the State of North Carolina with its principal office and place of business in Hickory, North Carolina, and is and was at all times material to this action engaged in the business of buying and selling, among other things, frozen concentrated orange juice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2. The defendant is the Secretary of Revenue of the State of North Carolina, and as such he is and he and his predecessor in office were at all times material to this action charged with the duty of enforcing the provisions of the North Carolina Soft Drink Tax Act set forth in Article 2B, Subchapter I, Chapter 105 of the General Statutes of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3. On 26 February 1972, plaintiff paid to the defendant's predecessor in office the sum of One Thousand One Hundred Nineteen Dollars and Ninety-Eight Cents ($ 1,119.98) representing taxes which the defendant's predecessor had assessed against the plaintiff upon the sale by the plaintiff (without having paid any soft drink tax thereon) of quantities of frozen concentrated orange juice to the following purchasers:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Alexander Hospital, Taylorsville, N. C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">4. Within thirty days after payment of said assessment of taxes, the plaintiff demanded in writing that defendant's predecessor refund said amount of taxes paid by plaintiff, which demand&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  was denied and no amount of said taxes has been refunded to the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">5. The products involved in this action, the sale of which is subject to the aforesaid tax assessment, consisted of canned frozen concentrated orange juice.  Such product is derived from pure, natural orange juice by the extraction of approximately three-fourths of the water therefrom, and is a 'natural fruit juice concentrate' as that term is used in G.S. 105-113.44(9).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">6. The restoration of approximately three parts of water to one part of the natural fruit juice concentrate involved in this action results in a 'liquid which results from the reconstitution of natural fruit juice concentrate by the restoration of water to dehydrated natural fruit juice' and such resultant liquid is the same as, and is the equivalent of 'natural fruit juice' as those terms are used in G.S. 105-113.44(9).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">7. No tax is imposed under the North Carolina Soft Drink Tax Act on the sale of frozen concentrated orange juice identical to that involved herein when such products are sold or held for sale in closed retail-sized containers by retailers, such as grocery stores and supermarkets, when such products are to be 'used domestically,' &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  which quoted phrase appears in G.S. 105-113.44(18) and which the defendant has interpreted to mean when such products are to be consumed by persons in homes and residences (as distinguished from what the defendant considers to be 'commercial use').  While frozen concentrated orange juice 'used domestically' is physically identical to frozen concentrated orange juice 'used commercially,' the defendant contends that the application of the tax depends upon the use to which the product is put (commercial, as opposed to domestic), on account of the provisions of G.S. 105-113.44(18).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">8. Natural fruit juices, including liquids resulting from the reconstitution of orange juice concentrate, by the restoration of water thereto, are sold in North Carolina for use and consumption in households and residences, and for use and consumption in places where food or drink may be obtained for a consideration, such as public school cafeterias and lunch rooms, hospitals, nursing homes and other institutions and restaurants serving the public.  The sale of such natural fruit juices is exempt from the North Carolina Soft Drink Tax, whether or not such natural fruit juices are sold for 'commercial' or 'domestic' &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  use and whether or not such natural fruit juices have been reconstituted by the restoration of water to a natural fruit juice concentrate either inside or outside of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">9. The defendant would not grant an exemption from the Soft Drink Tax for the orange juice concentrate involved in this action, if an application for such exemption were filed with the defendant pursuant to G.S. 105-113.47, which provides for an exemption from the tax for 'all bottled soft drinks containing thirty-five percent (35%) or more of natural fruit or vegetable juice . . .' The defendant would contend that orange juice concentrate is neither 'natural fruit juice' nor a 'bottled soft drink containing 35% or more of natural fruit juice.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">10. The orange juice concentrate involved in this action is not a 'bottled soft drink' as that term is used in G.S. 105-113.44(3) and G.S. 105-113.45(b) or a 'soft drink powder' as that term is used in G.S. 105-113.44(18) or G.S. 105-113.45(d) or a simple syrup as that term is used in G.S. 105-113.44(16) or G.S. 105-113.45(c), and such concentrate herein involved is taxable under the Soft Drink Tax Act only if the Court concludes that such concentrate is taxable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  as a 'base product' as that term is used in G.S. 105-113.44(1) or is taxable as a 'soft drink syrup' as that term is used in G.S. 105-113.44(18).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Conclusions of Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1. Fruit juice, both natural and reconstituted, is a soft drink, exempt from tax pursuant to G.S. 105-113.47.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2. Fruit juice concentrates, including the canned frozen concentrated orange juice which is the subject of this action, are not soft drinks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3. Fruit juice concentrates, including the canned frozen concentrated orange juice which is the subject of this action, are soft drink base products as defined in G.S. 105-113.44(1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">4. Soft drink base products, other than dry base products taxed as soft drink powders under G.S. 105-113.45(d), are taxed as syrups, pursuant to G.S. 105-113.44(1) and G.S. 105-113.45(c) when used commercially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">5. The canned frozen concentrated orange juice which is the subject of this action was used commercially, not domestically, and was subject to tax pursuant to G.S. 105-113.44(1) and G.S. 105-113.45(c).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">6. The General Assembly has, in the Soft Drink Tax Act, classified soft drink products into three categories: bottled soft drinks; soft drink powders; and soft drink syrups and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  base products taxed as syrups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">7. The General Assembly has further classified such syrups and base products into two classes: products which are used commercially and products which are not used commercially; and it has taxed only those which are used commercially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">8. The foregoing subclassification, based upon use, is based upon a reasonable distinction between the subclasses and is not arbitrary, capricious or unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">9. Fruit juice concentrates, including the canned frozen concentrated orange juice which is the subject of this action and which are soft drink base products taxed as syrups, are classified and taxed like all other syrups and base products taxed as syrups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">10. As such, they are taxed uniformly within their class, and there is no unconstitutional discrimination against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">11. The assessment made by the defendant was lawful and proper in all respects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Wherefore, it is Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed, that the plaintiff's action be dismissed, that the relief it seeks be denied, and that the costs of this action be taxed against the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">This the 15 day of May, 1975.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff objected and excepted to the failure of the court to find and conclude, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  additionally, that the concentrated orange juice involved in this action is not a &quot;soft drink syrup,&quot; and is not a product which is &quot;practically and commercially usable for the making of a soft drink,&quot; as those words are used in G.S. 105-113.44(8).  Plaintiff further took exception to each conclusion of law contained in the judgment &quot;for that such conclusion is not purported [supported] by or justified by the findings of fact and a proper interpretation of the Soft Drink Tax Act.&quot; Plaintiff excepted to the signing of the judgment and gave notice of appeal, assigning errors discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff retailer sought review of an order of the Wake Superior Court (North Carolina), which entered judgment in favor of defendant Secretary of Revenue of the State of North Carolina (secretary) in the retailer's action to recover taxes paid under the North Carolina Soft Drink Tax Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 105-113.41 (1969) et seq. The court allowed certiorari and the case was certified for initial appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retailer sold food products, including frozen concentrated orange juice, to commercial customers such as restaurants and hospitals. The retailer filed its action for a refund of taxes it paid under the act. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court first construed the act in order to determine if the sales involved were properly taxable under the terms of the act. The court was guided primarily by the legislature's intent. The court found that the act created a bifurcated scheme of taxation, under which bottled soft drinks were subjected to a &quot;crown tax&quot; and ingredients used to make &quot;open-cup soft drinks&quot; were subject to a tax on the sale of individual units. Bottled soft drinks that contained more than 35 percent natural fruit juice were exempt from the tax. The court held that the act was intended to tax only those &quot;soft drinks&quot; to which coloring, artificial flavoring, or preservative had been added, or which contained less than 35 percent natural fruit juice. Because the frozen concentrated orange juice was exempt from taxation when sold bottled, it followed that it could not be taxed as an ingredient in an &quot;open-cup soft drink.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of the secretary in the retailer's action for a refund of taxes paid under the North Carolina Soft Drink Tax Act. The court remanded the case to the trial court for it to enter a judgment for the retailer.</SPAN></P>

Bush, pursuant to G.S. 7A-27(a) from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Fountain, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 19 May 1975 Session Onslow Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon a bill of indictment which charged that &quot;James A. Bush late of the County of Onslow on the 18th day of November 1974, with force and arms, at and in the said County, feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought, did kill and murder Kirby W. Marshburn . . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eva A. Marshburn, wife of the deceased, testified that on 18 November 1974, after completing her work in Jacksonville, North Carolina, at about 9:10 p.m. she drove to her house trailer located near Highway 258 about eleven miles from Jacksonville.  Upon entering the hall of her trailer she observed that two bedrooms had been ransacked.  The contents of dresser drawers in each bedroom had been emptied on the bed and personal items were scattered about the rooms.  She had left the rooms in an orderly condition except for one unmade bed.  Mrs. Marshburn proceeded to the living room and there she observed her husband in the kitchen lying facedown in a pool of blood.  A blood-stained knife with a bent blade lay on the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  floor near her husband's body.  She recognized the knife as being one of her set of steak knives.  Her husband's wallet was also lying between his body and a kitchen cabinet.  Upon turning to reach for the telephone, she saw defendant who said, &quot;You're next.&quot; Defendant told her that he would have to kill her because she had seen his face and he knew that she would turn him in.  He then demanded money and upon his agreement to leave, she emptied her pocketbook which contained something over three dollars and gave it to him.  Defendant then cut the telephone line and tied the witness to a chair with some drapery cord taken from the curtains.  Mrs. Marshburn asked defendant why he killed her husband and he replied, &quot;He wouldn't do anything I asked him to do, so I had to kill him.&quot; After telling the witness that he was going to take her car, defendant left the trailer but returned in a few minutes and inquired about a gun and some ammunition.  The witness directed him to the gun and defendant then left in the Marshburn car.  Mrs. Marshburn was able to free herself and find help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert E. Lee of the Onslow Sheriff's Department testified that he went to the Marshburn home on the night&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of 18 November 1974 where he observed the body of Mr. Marshburn lying on the kitchen floor in a pool of blood.  He found a knife and a wallet near the body.  The officer described the premises as having been &quot;ramshackled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gwendolyn Cruz testified that she drove her 1974 Grand Prix automobile to work at the Area I Club on the afternoon of 18 November.  She placed her keys on the bar behind which she worked.  The witness observed defendant at the bar at about 4:30 p.m. and saw him leave at about 6:00 p.m. She later discovered that her automobile keys were missing and that her automobile had been stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnnie Burris testified that on the night of 18 November 1974, at about 8:15 p.m., he saw defendant standing beside a Grand Prix automobile which was in a ditch on the side of Highway 258, approximately one mile from Kirby Marshburn's house.  He offered to give defendant some assistance but defendant told him that he didn't want a wrecker and that he would get the car out later.  Burris stated that while he was there another man stopped and offered defendant a ride to Highway 17 but defendant declined this offer.  There was another dwelling immediately across the road.  It was later&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ascertained by police officers that the Grand Prix automobile belonged to Mr. and Mrs. Thurman Cruz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Papenfuse testified that on 18 November 1974, between 9:40 and 9:45 p.m., he saw defendant go into the Bang Bang Club.  A short time thereafter he observed defendant leave in an automobile which he thought was a Ford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Sheriff J. L. Jones of the Onslow Sheriff's Department, at about 11:30 on the same night, found a 1970 Ford, later identified as the Marshburn's car, approximately a quarter mile from the main gate of Camp Lejeune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of 19 November 1974 Officer Jarman of the Onslow Sheriff's Department located defendant at Camp Lejeune.  He advised defendant of his constitutional rights and questioned him concerning the events of the previous night.  Defendant stated that he had taken the Cruz automobile and driven it into a ditch and he thereafter walked to the Marshburn trailer home where Mr. Marshburn allowed him to use the telephone and also gave him a glass of water.  Defendant said that while they were in the kitchen, Mr. Marshburn, for no apparent reason, pushed him into the kitchen counter and that he grabbed a knife from a counter and stabbed Mr. Marshburn&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  several times.  Mr. Marshburn fell to the floor and defendant was attempting to drive away in the Marshburn truck when Mrs. Marshburn arrived.  He followed Mrs. Marshburn into the trailer, took some money from her and tied her into a chair.  He left in Mrs. Marshburn's automobile.  Defendant signed a statement after it was reduced to writing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered into evidence several articles of defendant's blood-stained clothing.  The blood stains were found to be of the same type as that of deceased.  Defendant's boots were introduced into evidence and the tread on the boots was similar to the bloody boot prints found on the floor of the Marshburn trailer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Walter Gable, an expert in pathology, testified that he examined Mr. Marshburn's body on the morning of 19 November 1974.  His examination revealed lacerations on the neck and face and four stab wounds in the front of the victim's body.  He testified that in his opinion Mr. Marshburn died as a result of a stab wound which penetrated the sternum and terminated in the victim's heart.  He further stated that the steak knife found near Mr. Marshburn's body could have been the instrument which inflicted the fatal wound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testifying in his own behalf stated that he went to the Area I Service Club at about 4:30 p.m. on 18 November where he drank beer until 7:15 p.m. He then took the Cruz automobile and was driving toward Richlands on Highway 258 when he lost control of the car and drove it into a ditch.  He later walked to the Marshburn trailer home where he asked Mr. Marshburn if he could use the telephone.  He had some conversation with Mr. Marshburn during which Mr. Marshburn said &quot;something about a colored boy down the road owned a wrecker.&quot; Defendant then asked Mr. Marshburn what color the boy was.  At this point he said that Mr. Marshburn pushed him toward the kitchen counter and told him to leave.  He picked up a knife from the counter and stabbed Mr. Marshburn a number of times.  Defendant said he had no intention of stealing anything at the time he stabbed Mr. Marshburn and that he immediately tried to leave the premises in the Marshburn truck.  There were no keys in the truck and he returned to the trailer and ransacked the bedroom in an unsuccessful search for the keys.  He then searched the body and found the keys in Mr. Marshburn's pants pocket.  As he prepared to leave in the truck, Mrs. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Marshburn arrived and he followed her into the house, took money from her, cut the telephone line, and tied Mrs. Marshburn into a chair.  He also took a rifle and some ammunition before driving away in the Marshburn automobile.  On cross-examination defendant testified that two people did offer him assistance at the place where he had driven the Cruz automobile into a ditch.  He also admitted that he passed a pay telephone booth on the way to the Marshburn trailer and he had some change in his pocket at that time.  He explained that he did not use the telephone because it was too near the stolen automobile and he was afraid that he would be accused of burglary because of its proximity to a store.  He further said that he thought there was another dwelling between the Marshburn residence and the stolen automobile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree.  Defendant appealed from a judgment imposing the death sentence.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant stole a car and drove it into a ditch near the victim's home and the victim allowed defendant to use his phone. Thereafter, defendant killed the victim with a knife. Defendant then searched the victim's body, stole the victim's wallet and keys, and ransacked the house. As defendant started to leave, the victim's wife returned home. As such, defendant returned to the home, robbed the victim's wife, took a gun, tied up the victim's wife, and left in a car belonging to the victim's wife. The court affirmed defendant 's conviction and held that defendant's actions in obtaining entrance into the victim's home in the nighttime and savagely and brutally attacking his benefactor with a knife with little or no provocation were circumstances which permitted an inference of premeditation and deliberation. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to find that after premeditation and deliberation defendant formed a fixed purpose to kill the victim and that defendant killed the victim while in the perpetration of a robbery. As such, the court held that the denial of defendant's motion for a judgment of nonsuit as to first-degree murder was not improper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By an indictment drawn under General Statute 15-144 defendant was charged with the murder on December 29, 1974, of Robert Abram Waller III.  On his plea of not guilty he was tried by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Baley, S.J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, during the second week of the March 31, 1975 Session of Guilford Superior Court.  Possible verdicts of murder in the first degree on the theories of felony murder and of a premeditated and deliberate murder, murder in the second degree, manslaughter and not guilty were submitted to the jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Criminal Session of Guilford County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted defendant after a jury returned a verdict of guilty of second degree murder.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant picked up two hitchhikers, and they rode around with defendant, sharing his marijuana cigarettes, and trying to find defendant's &quot;girl friend.&quot; The survivor told police that defendant held them up with a gun and knife, demanded money, and demanded that they submit to homosexual acts. A fight ensued. The victim was stabbed, shot, and died as a result of those wounds. Defendant claimed the men tried to steal his marijuana, a fight broke out, the victim threatened him with a knife, and he stabbed the victim then shot him for his own protection. A jury found defendant guilty of second-degree murder. On appeal, the court found no error. There was substantial evidence that supported the jury's verdict. The instructions of the trial court allowed the jury to consider first degree murder, second degree murder, manslaughter, and self-defense. Specific intent was not an element of second degree murder or manslaughter. The trial court was not required to instruct the jury on subordinate features of the case absent a specific request. Defendant was properly impeached on cross-examination about prior acts of misconduct when he testified in his own behalf.</SPAN></P>

App. 6, 214 S.E. 2d 605 (1975) (opinion by Morris, Judge, with Vaughn, Judge, concurring, and Clark, Judge, dissenting), finding no error in trial before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Crumpler, District Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 14 October 1974 Session, Duplin County District Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action to recover property damages to plaintiff's 1973 Chevrolet pickup truck growing out of a collision between the pickup truck operated by plaintiff's driver, Roger Parker, and defendants' 1967 G.M.C. tractor-trailer which plaintiff alleged was being negligently operated by defendant, Robert Pridgen, as agent of defendant, George W. Thomas, Inc.  Defendants answered denying negligence on the part of defendant Pridgen and alleging that plaintiff's driver was guilty of contributory negligence.  It was admitted that each driver was acting within the course and scope of his employment and as agent of his respective employer at the time of the collision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Parker testified that on the 1st day of August 1973 at about 9:00 a.m. he and corporate defendant's driver were operating their respective trucks in the same direction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on rural paved road 1146 and that he came up behind the truck operated by defendant Pridgen, blew his horn and started to pass.  As he came alongside the G.M.C. tractor-trailer, defendant Pridgen turned left into plaintiff's truck.  He at no time observed any turn signals as he approached the truck.  He further testified that a narrow dirt road intersected the rural paved road.  There were no city limit signs in the area although there was a &quot;Welcome to Rose Hill&quot; sign off the shoulder of the road.  &quot;It was in the same position where regular highway signs are.  It was not the regular original city limit type sign.&quot; Parker described the area in which the accident took place as &quot;really growed up . . . corn, woods down one side, and a field over on the other, corn and stuff I guess.  Crops.&quot; He said that &quot;There were no regulatory markings of any intersections in that area at the time of the accident.&quot; He further stated that &quot;I was hooked up at that time with a hatchery down at Rose Hill where the old Rose Hill Hardware used to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Masters, the Chief of Police of Rose Hill, described the area in these words, &quot;It is not built up in between Church Street to 1146.  It's no houses&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in there.  A corn field lies in there.  Or tobacco.  This is out in farm country.&quot; The Chief of Police also stated that he investigated the accident and that he gave defendant Pridgen a ticket for improper equipment because the left rear directional signal on the tractor-trailer was not working.  Pridgen entered a plea of guilty to the charge.  Mr. Parker was not charged.  Masters further testified that city limit signs had been erected since the accident but that none were there on the date of the accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Pridgen testified that prior to the collision he heard no horn and did not see plaintiff's truck.  He was going about ten miles per hour when he started making his turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was stipulated that the accident occurred within the city limits of Rose Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury answered the issues submitted as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the appeal was filed in this Court on July 31, 1975, defendant moved to amend the record on August 19, 1975, to note additional exceptions and assignments of error which would raise for review additional questions suggested by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Mullaney v. Wilbur</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 421 U.S. 684, decided on June 9, 1975.  This motion was allowed on September 2, 1975, and the case argued on September 10, 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged with the second degree murder of Gregory Ashe and entered a plea of not guilty.  It was stipulated that had Dr. D. E. Scarborough, who performed the postmortem examination, been present at trial he would have testified that Gregory Ashe died on September 29, 1974, as a result of massive hemorrhage resulting from a gunshot wound to the heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence for the State tended to show that on the night of September 29, 1974, Lorenzo Dancy, Wilbert Whitley, and the deceased, Gregory Ashe, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  left a dance hall and drove to a poolroom in Whitakers.  Ashe was driving his car.  Upon arrival at the poolroom, they discovered that it was closed.  Ashe was unable then to restart his car.  Ashe asked Dancy and Whitley for a match to light a cigarette.  Neither had a match.  Whitley announced that he was going to his home, one block away, and began walking.  Dancy and Ashe were also walking away from the car when Ashe said that he was going back to &quot;crank&quot; the car.  Dancy indicated that he was going on with Whitley.  Dancy testified that he yelled for Whitley to wait and then proceeded to walk after Whitley.  When last seen alive by Dancy, Ashe was seen walking alone back towards his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments later Dancy and Whitley each heard a gun fire.  Dancy heard Ashe exclaim that he was shot and hollered this information to Whitley.  A yellow and black Plymouth &quot;Satellite&quot; was observed pulling away at a fast rate of speed.  It did not stop when it reached the nearby intersection of U.S. 301.  Dancy and Whitley had differing accounts of whether the car left before or after Dancy hollered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting had occurred some time after 11:00 o'clock.  Because of the darkness it was difficult&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to find Ashe.  Around 12:00 o'clock, Ashe was discovered lying face down in a field about thirty feet from the road.  A cigarette, which had been lit but which was now out, was in Ashe's hand.  The body was removed at 4:00 or 5:00 o'clock that morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After determining the identity of the owner of the Plymouth, several law enforcement officers, including Deputy Sheriff M. M. Reams went to defendant's home, advised defendant of his rights, and questioned him.  Defendant told Deputy Reams that he had been to Whitakers, had shot a person who had grabbed him and tried to cut his throat but did not know whether he had hit him.  Reams testified that defendant's car was searched with his consent and a knife was found in the middle of the front seat.  Also found in the car was a &quot;.30-06,&quot; ammunition for the &quot;.30-06,&quot; and a hunting knife.  Blood was observed on the driver's side of the car, just behind the door.  Defendant gave Reams a shirt with a grease spot and stated that was where he had been grabbed.  When asked about the pistol used in the shooting (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">not</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the &quot;.30-06&quot;), defendant told Reams that he was &quot;in the process of buying&quot; it but had already returned it to the seller, whom&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he refused to identify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination Reams gave this additional account of defendant's statements: Defendant was driving his Plymouth &quot;Satellite&quot; automobile near the poolroom when a man stopped him and asked him for a light.  Defendant gave the man the cigarette lighter from the dash of his automobile.  Defendant felt someone &quot;shaking the car, shaking the right door that was locked.&quot; Defendant put the cigarette lighter back in the holder and when he turned around &quot;the man&quot; was reaching in with a knife at his throat and had a hand on defendant's chest.  Defendant reached down, got a revolver, and &quot;shot the man who already had his hand on his left chest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Reams also testified that after taking defendant's statement he returned to the morgue and examined the deceased's hands.  He found no grease on them.  Several witnesses for the State testified that they had never seen the deceased with a knife like the one in evidence found in defendant's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified giving the following account of the incident: He was driving his Plymouth automobile slowly over a road containing large holes when someone asked for a light.  Through his car mirror, defendant could see&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  two men.  One of them walked up to the car and defendant reached over to the dash of the car, pushed in the cigarette lighter, and gave the lighter to him.  On returning the lighter to its holder, defendant felt the car move, and looked and noticed the second man standing on the right-hand side of the car.  As he turned back to his left, the first man reached into his car, seized him by the left shoulder with his right hand and put a knife to defendant's throat with his left hand.  Defendant felt the knife at his throat, grabbed his gun and shot.  He surmised that his assailant dropped his knife in the car since it did not belong to the defendant.  Defendant admitted that he lied to the police about the where-abouts of the gun.  He said:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;The pistol was in my house at the time the law came there.  He did ask me for the pistol then.  I told him I had returned it to the person I got it from.  I had not returned it.  It was in the house right then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;The reason I didn't tell the Sheriff the truth about where the pistol was was because at that time I just wasn't thinking, but after I got up here in jail I decided I might as well go ahead and tell them.  My wife had already&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  given it to the officers at that time.  It is true that I never told them where the pistol was.  If they had wanted to search the house they could have found it right there under the mattress.  I did not hide the gun.  That was just to keep it away from the children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's wife, however, testified that she got the pistol from defendant's drawer where &quot;I am sure he put it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In rebuttal the State introduced evidence that Gregory Ashe was right-handed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found defendant guilty of second degree murder.  He was sentenced to not less than 20 nor more than 25 years imprisonment.  The Court of Appeals found no error, Arnold, J., dissenting.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motions for judgment of nonsuit. On appeal, the court found no error. Nonsuit was properly denied in view of the evidence that casted doubt on defendant's version of the incident. Accordingly, the State was not bound by the exculpatory portions of defendant's statement. The trial court's misstatement to the jury about defendant's prior arrest did not constitute reversible error because it was based on a collateral matter. The court found that, based on the United States Supreme Court's recent decision, the jury instructions that relieved the State of its burden to prove malice and unlawfulness by requiring a defendant to prove that he killed in the heat of sudden passion to rebut the presumption of malice and that he killed in self-defense to rebut the presumption of unlawfulness were unconstitutional. Although the jury instructions were found unconstitutional, that recent decision did not apply retroactively to defendant, whose case was tried some eight months before that decision. The law that applied to defendant permitted the burden to be placed upon him to rebut the presumptions of malice and unlawfulness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found no error in the trial court's denial of defendant's motions for judgment of nonsuit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant pursuant to G.S. 7A-27(a) from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Collier, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 17 February 1975 Criminal Session of Guilford Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence, in summary, tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Segal testified that on 4 May 1974 he left Charlotte at about 11:00 a.m. with defendant who was going to Greensboro for the purpose of picking up his girl friend, Ruby Jean McCrorey (Ruby).  They arrived in Greensboro at about 1:00 and defendant went to several residences and made numerous telephone calls in a vain search for Ruby between 1:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. When they started back to Charlotte at about 6:00 p.m., the witness was driving because defendant was not feeling well.  Segal became lost and finally turned around near the Virginia state line and they returned to Greensboro where defendant stopped at a hospital.  There defendant made several telephone calls.  They then drove to the police department where the witness and defendant parted company.  Segal further testified that he had known Ruby while she and defendant were living together in Charlotte.  He also identified State's Exhibit 2 as the .22 pistol he had seen in defendant's possession on 4 May 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Officer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  James Hilliard testified that defendant came to the police station on 4 May 1974.  Defendant had his girl friend's telephone number, but did not know her address.  Using the City Directory, the officer located an address on Whittington Street that corresponded to the telephone number in defendant's possession.  Defendant indicated to him that he had caught his girl friend with another man a few weeks prior to that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joslyn Barnes testified that she and Ruby McCrorey were living in the Barnes's home at 213 West Whittington Street in Greensboro on 4 May 1974.  On that day, they were having a surprise birthday party for Joslyn's mother.  She stated that there were four telephone calls for Ruby between 9:00 and 12:00 p.m. The witness further testified that shortly after midnight she was standing beside Ruby at a point between the kitchen and the living room when defendant came through the front door into the house.  At that time Ruby exclaimed &quot;George,&quot; defendant shot twice and Ruby fell.  She further testified that as she went out the front door, she looked back and saw Ruby falling.  She passed very close to defendant as she left the house and she heard another shot after she had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  gone outside.  She made an in-court identification of defendant as the man who did the shooting and identified State's Exhibit 2 as the murder weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harris Nesmith testified that he attended the party and that during the evening he answered the phone three times.  We will fully consider the evidence concerning the telephone calls in the opinion.  Nesmith further testified that at around midnight he was sitting in the kitchen drinking beer with Willie Watlington when he heard two shots.  He at first thought that the explosions were caused by firecrackers.  He got up to look when he heard the third explosion and at that time saw defendant with &quot;the gun at the girl's head.&quot; Defendant came into the kitchen and &quot;threw&quot; the pistol on Willie Watlington but did not fire.  Nesmith then left the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willie Watlington gave testimony to the effect that he was sitting in the kitchen with Harris Nesmith when he heard a couple of shots.  He also thought the noise was caused by firecrackers.  Shortly thereafter defendant came into the kitchen with a pistol in his hand.  At that time, the witness laid his head on the table.  After defendant left, the witness went into the living room where he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  found Ruby lying on the floor.  There was a wound on her head and it appeared that her ear had been shot off.  The witness said that he had been &quot;going with Ruby.&quot; He testified, over defendant's objection, that the pistol identified as State's Exhibit 2 was &quot;something about like&quot; the weapon the defendant had in his hand on the night of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheryl Wilson said that she saw a man come in the front door and shoot Ruby.  She was unable to identify the man who did the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnny Lee Brown testified that he was sitting in the living room of the house at 213 West Whittington Street at about midnight when he looked out the window and saw this &quot;dude&quot; running up the walk with a &quot;shiny&quot; gun in his hand.  The man snatched the door open and fired a shot downward.  The witness then fled.  He identified defendant as the man who fired the pistol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portia Elaine Lindsey, who lived across the street from the house where the party was held, testified that she saw a cab and a green Chevrolet pull up before the house and she saw the cab driver point to the house at 213 West Whittington Street.  The man who drove the green Chevrolet went to the front of the house and she heard someone say&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;George.&quot; This exclamation was followed by the sound of three shots.  She later saw a man run from the house and as he turned toward a police officer, the police officer fired his pistol and the man fell.  He fell near a streetlight.  She identified defendant as the man who ran from the house and fell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer K. L. Durham was riding along Whittington Street when he heard gunshots.  He saw several people run out the front door of the house at 213 West Whittington Street.  Defendant ran in front of him, stopped and pointed a pistol toward him and the pistol then made a clicking noise.  Thereafter defendant ran and when the policeman called for defendant to stop, defendant made a turn toward him with the gun in his hand.  Officer Durham fired one shot and defendant ran about fifty feet and fell.  Upon taking defendant into custody, the officer observed a wound on defendant's right hand.  The officer later picked up a .22 caliber pistol across the street from 213 West Whittington Street which he identified as State's Exhibit 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Paul Biggs was also traveling on Whittington Street when he heard two or three shots.  He parked his car and heard more shots when he approached 213&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  West Whittington Street.  He saw a figure run from the house, heard a louder shot and shortly after he heard the louder shot, the running man fell.  He later entered the house and found a wounded woman lying on the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Edward A. Sharpless, an expert in pathology, testified that he performed an autopsy on the body of Ruby Jean McCrorey on 5 May 1974.  His examination revealed that deceased had been shot three times.  One bullet entered the right shoulder and followed a path approximately parallel with the floor.  Another penetrated the skull from left to right taking a piece of deceased's left ear with it.  The third bullet entered the top of her head passing forward and downward, penetrating both sides of the brain.  In his opinion, the cause of death was the gunshot wound which penetrated deceased's brain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State rested and defendant thereupon testified that, accompanied by William Segal, he came to Greensboro on 4 May 1974 for the purpose of taking Ruby back home.  He had been furnished an address on Ashe Street as the place where he might locate her and upon failing to find Ruby, he called her mother in New York who was unable to give him any information.  He asked Segal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to drive him back to Charlotte at about 6:00 p.m. because he felt bad as a result of a recent gunshot wound in his stomach.  He went to sleep and when he awakened they were near the Virginia line.  He then drove back to Greensboro where he made a call to Ruby's uncle in New York who agreed to contact Ruby and ask her to call defendant.  Ruby called and some &quot;dude&quot; on the phone told him how to get to the hospital.  He called Ruby from the hospital and she told him she would come there.  He waited in the car for about an hour and tried without success to again call Ruby.  He then went to the police station where a police officer helped him locate the residence at 213 West Whittington Street.  He proceeded to that address.  Upon going to the porch of the house, he heard shots and heard Ruby &quot;holler.&quot; He entered the house and saw Ruby lying on the floor and at the same time observed someone going out the back door with a gun in his hand.  Defendant stated that he pulled his pistol, ran to the back door, and shot several times.  He came back to the place where Ruby was lying and saw a hand in the back door pointing a pistol.  He then ran out the front door and heard another shot.  He ran&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in front of a police car and saw someone pointing a gun at him.  As he turned, a bullet struck him in the hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified that he did not fire a shot at Ruby.  He had no ill will toward her but to the contrary he loved Ruby.  He admitted that he and Ruby had lived together in Charlotte for about two years and that there had been some misunderstanding between them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruth DeBerry, an employee of Congessman Richardson Preyer, said that she lived directly across the street from the place where the party was held.  She attended the party and as she was leaving, she heard a scream.  She called the police and she heard further hollering from the house across the street.  She went to her porch where she saw two people run from the back door of the house across the street and she then saw two flashes caused by gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of murder in the second degree.  Defendant appealed from judgment imposing a sentence of imprisonment for his natural life.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the judgment from the Guilford Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted defendant of murder in the second degree and imposed a sentence of imprisonment for defendant's natural life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court found no error warranting a new trial or mandating that the judgment of the trial court be disturbed. For example, the court held that the trial court correctly submitted to the jury as possible verdicts first-degree murder, second-degree murder or a verdict of not guilty because these were the only verdicts supported by the evidence. In addition, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's intentional use of the deadly weapon was done unlawfully and with malice, and that a challenged jury charge did not relieve the state of its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of the crime charged. Nevertheless, the court held that under the circumstances of the case, the state should not have offered defendant's silence about the events of the night in question as evidence of his guilt or for the purpose of impeaching him as a witness. However, because the evidence was of insignificant probative value when compared with the overwhelming competent evidence of defendant's guilt, the admission of the evidence was deemed to be harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant under G.S. 7A-27(a) from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Gavin, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 3 March 1975 Session of Moore County Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon two bills of indictment.  One charged him with the armed robbery of Kenneth McAskill on 6 January 1975; the other, drawn under G.S. 15-144, charged him with the murder of John Henry McAskill on the same day.  The State offered evidence that tended to show the facts summarized below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deceased, John Henry McAskill (Mr. McAskill), owned and operated a grocery and filling station known as Honeycutt's Grocery Store in West End in Moore County.  About 6:45 p.m. on 6 January 1975, two black men entered the store.  The first man was approximately six feet tall and weighed about 160 pounds.  He was dressed in heavy green military fatigues, carried a revolver, and wore a brown and gold ski mask pulled down over his face.  The second man, who was shorter and heavier, carried a sawed-off shotgun.  He too wore a fatigue jacket and mask.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the two men entered, Mr. McAskill was dozing by the store's heater in a chair which faced the doorway.  His son, Kenneth McAskill (Kenneth), aged 19, was sitting opposite him.  No one else was in the store.  Thinking&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the men were prospective customers, Kenneth rose to serve them.  At that time, the first man pointed the revolver at Kenneth and demanded his money, saying, &quot;This is a hold-up.&quot; When Kenneth reached for the billfold in his hip pocket the man ordered him to stop and to turn sideways so that he could see for what he was reaching.  Kenneth complied with his demands and, as the man continued to hold the revolver on him, he handed over his billfold containing approximately fifteen dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this time the other man was holding the shotgun on Mr. McAskill, who had awakened.  As he raised himself in the chair, the first man shouted, &quot;Get him.&quot; One of the men shot Mr. McAskill, and both then ran from the store.  Kenneth went immediately to a nearby trailer and telephoned for the police and for an ambulance.  Both responded within minutes, and Mr. McAskill was taken to the hospital, where he died a short time later as the result of the gunshot wound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Sheriff Watkins arrived at the scene about 7:00 p.m. After questioning Kenneth, who was still there and &quot;terribly upset,&quot; Deputy Watkins began his investigation.  When he found two sets of footprints leading from the store in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the direction the men had fled, bloodhounds were called, and they followed the tracks to a cemetery.  There the officers found automobile tire tracks, and at that point the footprints stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following morning Dr. R. L. Stuber, Chief Medical Examiner of Moore County, autopsied the body of Mr. McAskill and removed therefrom a bullet which he delivered to Deputy Watkins.  This bullet had entered the left side of Mr. McAskill's neck and lodged in his spine.  In Dr. Stuber's opinion, this bullet (State's Exhibit 6) had caused Mr. McAskill's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 18 January 1975 at about 11:00 p.m., Deputy Watkins accompanied by SBI Agent Bill Dowdy, stopped a green Vega automobile driven by defendant.  Deputy Watkins frisked defendant and found a loaded .38 caliber revolver in his inside coat pocket.  Thereupon, defendant was placed under arrest for carrying a concealed weapon.  At trial the judge conducted a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to determine the validity of the arrest, which was made without a warrant, and the admissibility of the revolver into evidence.  On </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the testimony of Deputy Watkins tended to show the following facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately two days before defendant was arrested on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  18 January 1975, Deputy Watkins received information from a confidential informant that defendant had a .38 caliber revolver.  During the six months prior to 18 January 1975, on 20-25 occasions, this informant had given Watkins information which was proven to be reliable.  Prior to January 18th Watkins did not know of defendant's existence.  On that date, about one hour before defendant was arrested, the same informant told Deputy Watkins that defendant had concealed on his person a .38 revolver; that it was the weapon which had killed Mr. McAskill; and that defendant and another man had committed the armed robbery and murder in West End.  He also said that defendant was driving a green 1974 Vega and that he was at a particular bar in Southern Pines.  Under the circumstances Watkins felt it would be unwise to take the time to procure a search warrant.  Defendant &quot;was out with his automobile&quot; and there was &quot;a good possibility&quot; he would leave town or dispose of the weapon before the officers could get a search warrant and relocate him.  Deputy Watkins and SBI Agent Dowdy, therefore, proceeded to the bar where defendant was reported to be.  When they arrived, defendant was no longer there. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After checking two more bars in the area which the informant had said defendant frequented, the officers were proceeding to still another bar when they passed defendant in his green 1974 Vega.  Deputy Watkins stopped the Vega and identified himself to the defendant, who was the sole occupant of the car.  After asking for defendant's driver's license, Deputy Watkins asked him to get out of his car which he did.  The deputy then instructed defendant to put his hands on the car and told him he had been informed he was carrying a concealed weapon.  At that point Watkins &quot;frisked him down&quot; and found the .38 revolver (State's Exhibit 5), loaded with five rounds of ammunition, in defendant's inside coat pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon discovering the gun Watkins told him he was under arrest for carrying a concealed weapon.  Defendant's reply was, &quot;If I [had known] that was the reason you were stopping me, I would have killed all of you, or you would have had to kill me.&quot; He said he would never have been taken alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon findings supported by the foregoing evidence, the trial judge concluded that the arrest and accompanying search were valid, and he admitted the revolver into evidence.  Thereafter, before&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the jury, Watkins gave substantially the same testimony with reference to this on-the-scene arrest of defendant and the seizure of the pistol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately after arresting defendant, Deputy Watkins and Agent Dowdy took him to the Southern Pines Police Department.  There, about 11:30 p.m., Dowdy told defendant he wanted to talk to him about the murder of John McAskill and the robbery of his son.  He then advised defendant of his constitutional rights in strict conformity with the requirements of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda v. Arizona</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). He informed defendant, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, of his right to the advice and presence of counsel before and during police questioning, and defendant was told that if he was indigent and desired an attorney one would be appointed for him.  He said he understood his rights and did not desire an attorney; that he was ready to talk to the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point in the trial defendant requested a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and, in the absence of the jury, Dowdy gave testimony which, in pertinent part, is summarized below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant is 24 years old.  Dowdy questioned him in the presence of Deputy Watkins in the office of the Chief of Police.  Defendant was not handcuffed; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he did not appear to be ill or under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  No threats, promises, or inducements of any kind were made to defendant.  During the first 30-40 minutes of the interview defendant was questioned about his family background, education, military service, and where he had lived and worked.  Defendant cooperated fully and spoke freely on these subjects, and he said he had purchased the pistol (Exhibit 5) on 3 January 1975 from an unknown black male.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Dowdy asked defendant if he had bought any .38 ammunition he replied that he had not.  Dowdy then informed him that the records of a hardware store in Aberdeen showed that he had purchased such ammunition there prior to 6 January 1975; that the police knew two black males had gone into McAskill's store, robbed the boy, and shot Mr. McAskill; that the two men had parked on a back road and walked around the store before going inside; that the description of one of the men fitted defendant; that the officers had casts of the tire tracks and of the footprints which led to the tire tracks; and that tests would be made to ascertain if the bullet removed from Mr. McAskill's body was fired from defendant's gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  receiving the foregoing information defendant said, &quot;I do not want to say anything else at this point.&quot; Agent Dowdy terminated the interrogation and asked SBI Agent Inscoe to obtain a description of defendant, his vital statistics, and the other information required for the police records.  Dowdy then left the room to make arrangements for the firearms examiner to determine whether the bullet was fired from defendant's pistol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 20-30 minutes later, Agent Dowdy came back into the room, and Deputy Sheriff Watkins served upon defendant the murder warrant he had obtained.  Dowdy then asked defendant if there was anything he could do for him.  Defendant made three requests: that Dowdy call his parents and his brother; that he go &quot;up and talk to his girl friend&quot; and &quot;be discreet&quot;; and that he get him some cherry lifesavers.  Dowdy told defendant he would do the three things he requested and, at that point, defendant said to him, &quot;I might as well tell you about it, but I am going to take the blame for all of it. . . .  I shot McAskill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to Dowdy's request that he &quot;explain what happened,&quot; defendant made the statement which, as related by Dowdy, is summarized below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  night of January 6th defendant and his &quot;partner&quot; drove from Southern Pines to West End in defendant's green '74 Vega, parked it on a dirt road on the edge of a cemetery, and walked across a railroad track and a field to the back of McAskill's store.  Through a window they saw a boy and an old man, who was sitting in a chair.  Defendant and his partner, both wearing ski masks, went into the store.  Defendant, carrying the pistol, which the officers subsequently took from him, entered first.  Upon demand, the boy gave him his wallet.  At that time the old man started going in his back pocket and defendant thought he had a gun.  Defendant later changed this to say that the old man pulled a gun and pointed it at his partner.  Defendant told his partner &quot;to get him.&quot; The partner &quot;would not do anything&quot;; so he shot the old man, who fell to the floor.  They ran out the door and back to the car in the same direction from whence they came.  There was $ 15 in the boy's wallet, which was thrown away somewhere along the road as they returned to Southern Pines.  They divided the fifteen dollars between them, but his partner gave him fifty cents more for his gasoline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant refused to describe&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the gun his partner was carrying or to name him.  He said they had made a pact -- if one got caught he would not tell on the other.  He told the officers that the ski masks were in the closet in his room at his parents' home and gave them permission to obtain them.  He also gave permission to make casts of his automobile tires and of his shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dowdy's interview with defendant began about 11:30 p.m. and was concluded at 12:20 or 12:30 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's testimony on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, summarized except when quoted, tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After he was taken to Chief Seawell's office in Southern Pines they began trying to get him to confess to a murder and attempted robbery.  He denied everything and kept denying it, but finally he confessed because (he said) &quot;it was my car and my gun used and it's being loyal to some friends.&quot; Mr. Dowdy read him his rights and he thought he understood them but evidently he didn't since he had confessed &quot;to something like that.&quot; Defendant also said that the officers told him if he &quot;would talk, they would talk to the solicitor and to the judge and he would take that into consideration and go easy on [him].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination defendant stated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that he had not been drinking or taking drugs; that when he was arrested he knew the pistol he was carrying had been used in the robbery and shooting; and that the officers did not threaten him during their interrogation but the situation made him scared and nervous.  He said anyone would be frightened if his car had been used in an armed robbery and if he were found with the gun that had killed a man.  Defendant said he knew who killed Mr. McAskill and robbed Kenneth but he would not tell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With reference to his actual confession defendant testified:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At one point I told Mr. Dowdy I did not want to say anything further.  Some 20 or 25 minutes later he came back in the room and asked me if he could do anything.  That's when I told him I wanted my parents and my girl friend contacted and for him to get me some cherry Lifesavers.  He said he would do those things.  I think it was then that I told him that I might as well tell him about it.  I told him about it without being asked any questions about the murder or the robbery.  He was asking me about the murder.  I think it was anywhere from five to ten minutes before I told him that I might as well tell him about it.  That he had been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  asking me about the murder.  I told him that I had shot McAskill and that I was going to take all the blame only because they were trying to pick up innocent people. . . .  I told them that I had made a pact with others that I wasn't going to tell about them.  I told Mr. Dowdy how the crimes had been committed.  Because I had been lending my car to other guys to use and they would do these things and tell me about them so I knew just about what was going on.  I told Mr. Dowdy how the crime had been committed, where the car was parked, how the building was entered and where Mr. McAskill and his son were in the store at the time of the robbery.  I did not necessarily have to be there in order to describe how the crime was committed because I had been by there several times and I knew where the guys had parked the car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the court found that defendant's confession was freely, voluntarily and understandingly made after he had been fully informed and warned of all his constitutional rights and after he had expressly waived the presence of counsel; that no threats or promises had been made to defendant to secure his confession; and that defendant's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  statement was admissible in evidence.  Thereafter, in conformity with his testimony on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Agent Dowdy then testified before the jury as to the content of defendant's statement to him and the circumstances under which it was made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">F. G. Satterfield, a firearms examiner for the State Bureau of Investigation, whom the court found to be an expert in the identification of firearms, testified that he had test-fired defendant's pistol, Exhibit 5, and compared the test bullets with the bullet, Exhibit 6; that, in his opinion, Exhibit 6 was fired in Exhibit 5 and that it could not have been fired in any other weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Watkins, recalled, testified that between 12:30 a.m. and 1:00 a.m. on 19 January 1975 he went to defendant's residence, &quot;explained to Mr. and Mrs. McZorn exactly what had happened,&quot; told them defendant had given the officers his permission to look for the masks at the bottom of his closet and secured their permission.  He found the masks where defendant said they would be.  The two masks were introduced in evidence, and the State rested its case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the State's evidence defendant informed the court that he was exercising his right to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  remain silent and would offer no evidence.  Counsel for defendant told the court that he had explained to defendant that, since he had offered no evidence, his counsel was entitled to make the closing argument to the jury; that notwithstanding, defendant wanted his case submitted to the jury without argument.  Upon the court's inquiry defendant confirmed counsel's statement.  Whereupon the judge charged the jury.  Thereafter the jury returned verdicts that &quot;defendant is guilty of robbery with a firearm as charged in the bill of indictment,&quot; and that &quot;defendant is guilty of murder in the first degree as charged in the bill of indictment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the conviction of robbery with a firearm the court adjudged that defendant be imprisoned for the term of 30 years.  Upon the conviction of murder in the first degree, the court imposed the sentence of death.  From the sentence of death defendant appealed directly to this Court as a matter of right and, under G.S. 7A-31(a), we certified his conviction of armed robbery for initial appellate review at the same time.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of his conviction by the Moore County Superior Court (North Carolina), entered upon a jury verdict, for murder in the first degree and the imposed death sentence as matter of right. The court certified his conviction for armed robbery and 30 year sentence for initial appellate review at the same time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction for murder in the first degree and armed robbery on the ground that the stopping of his vehicle and the frisking of his person were unconstitutional; that his subsequent arrest was in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-41; and that the revolver taken from his inside coat pocket was erroneously admitted into evidence. The court affirmed the conviction for murder in the first degree. The tip of a known informant carried sufficient &quot;indicia of reliability&quot; to justify the initial stop. The officer, a man of reasonable caution, was warranted in the belief that the defendant was armed with a weapon based on the informant's tip. The reasonableness of this belief was demonstrated by defendant's remark that he had known the purpose for which the officers had stopped him and that he would have killed them before permitting them to take him alive, justifying the frisk. As the arrest was not unconstitutional or in violation of state statute, the pistol was properly admitted into evidence. Finally, as the armed robbery had been used to prove an essential element of the charge of murder in the first degree, defendant could not be sentenced for the robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court arrested the judgment as to the charge of armed robbery against defendant and affirmed the judgment as to the charge for murder in the first degree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c1"><SPAN CLASS="c4">October 7, 1975, Filed </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to review the decision of the North Carolina Court of Appeals reported in 25 N.C. App. 478, 212 S.E. 2d 921 (1975), which dismissed the appeal of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of North Carolina (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Commissioner&quot;) from judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Bailey, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered 31 October 1974 in Wake Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 25A of Chapter 58 of the General Statutes (G.S. 58-248.26 to G.S. 58-248.40) (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Facility Act&quot;) creates the North Carolina Motor Vehicle Reinsurance Facility (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Facility&quot;).  The Facility Act requires that all motor vehicle insurers be members of the Facility and that the profit or loss of otherwise unacceptable business (to the extent permitted in the plan of operation) be transferred from the individual insurer to all insurers.  Furthermore, pursuant to G.S. 58-248.33(a) (6), &quot;[the] Facility is authorized to require all companies in a fair and equitable manner who are writers of motor vehicle insurance in this State to appoint and licence any fire and casualty agent duly licensed to write insurance in North Carolina, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">in such places where a market need had been demonstrated</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  , to be their agent to write motor vehicle insurance.&quot; (Emphasis supplied.) Purportedly acting pursuant to the above section, the Board of Governors of the Facility required State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Insurance Company&quot;) to appoint and license Joseph T. Williams as its agent to write automobile liability insurance.  There was a showing that Williams needed to be appointed to an insurance company, but there was no demonstration that the public had a market need for additional agents in the area involved in order to secure adequate insurance coverage.  Insurance Company appealed to the Commissioner pursuant to G.S. 58-248.39(b), and the Commissioner affirmed the Board of Governors.  Insurance Company then appealed to Wake County Superior Court as allowed by G.S. 58-248.39(f) whereupon the order below was reversed and vacated.  The superior court determined that (1) the order requiring Insurance Company to appoint and license Williams as its agent was unconstitutional under the due process and equal protection of the law clauses of Article I, Section 19, of the North Carolina Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Constitution; (2) the Facility did not conduct a review to determine if eligible risks could readily obtain insurance; and (3) no need for additional agents to sell insurance existed.  Commissioner alone appealed this decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals allowed Insurance Company's motion to dismiss the appeal.  The Court of Appeals did not detail its grounds for dismissal, but apparently the reasons were that the Commissioner was not the real party in interest and not an aggrieved party so as to permit him to appeal pursuant to the provisions set forth in G.S. 58-9.3.  This Court granted certiorari to review this decision.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent state commissioner of insurance sought certiorari review of the North Carolina Court of Appeals' dismissal of his appeal of a judgment finding that requiring petitioner to appoint an insurance agent was unconstitutional, because respondent was not a real party in interest and not an aggrieved party pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 58-9.3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An order requiring petitioner insurance company to appoint and license an agent was held unconstitutional under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The North Carolina Motor Vehicle Reinsurance Facility (Facility) was found to have failed to conduct a review to determine if eligible risks could readily obtain insurance. No need was found for additional agents to sell insurance. The lower court granted petitioner's motion to dismiss respondent's appeal because respondent state commissioner of insurance was not a real party in interest. On certiorari, the state supreme court affirmed. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 58-248.33(g)(1) made the Board of Governors of the Facility the public's representative to the exclusion of all others except where the Facility Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 58-248.26 to 58-248.40, expressly provided otherwise. Since the commissioner was not deemed to be an aggrieved party or a representative of the public in this matter, the party actually aggrieved by the lower court judgment was the Facility or agent, not the commissioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Dismissal of the appeal was affirmed because the common law rule applied that respondent state insurance commissioner must be an aggrieved person in order to perfect his appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On appeal pursuant to G.S. 7A-31 from judgment by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Bailey, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 11 November 1974 Session of Wake Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was initiated by the filing of a complaint on 29 August 1974 which alleged, in summary, that:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">I. The plaintiffs are citizens and taxpayers of Wake County and represent a class of people too numerous to enumerate who are also citizens and taxpayers of Wake County and are similarly situated in all matters complained of herein, and the persons named as plaintiffs herein will fairly insure the adequate representation of all the persons in the said class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">II. The defendant Wake County Board of Education is a body corporate and has the power, pursuant to G.S. 115-27, to sue and be sued in its corporate capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">III. On or about 24 October 1973, the defendant voted to consolidate Knightdale, Wendell and Zebulon into a comprehensive high school to be located in eastern Wake County.  On or about the same date, defendant also announced that the comprehensive high school would be located in the vicinity of Lizard Lick, just west of Zebulon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">IV. Thereafter defendant selected a site on the western edge of Zebulon commonly referred to in the community&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  as &quot;The Yancey Farm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">V. Thereafter the Wake County Board of Commissioners failed to approve funds for the purchase of the Yancey farm site, and still refuses to approve such funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">VI. Despite the refusal of the Board of Commissioners to approve funds for the purchase of the Yancey farm site, defendant now proposes, pursuant to G.S. 115-126(d), to exchange 40.462 acres which it now owns in eastern Wake County for 40.46 acres of the Yancey farm site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">VII. On 21 August 1974, defendant filed notice with the Wake County Clerk of Superior Court of its intention to effect such exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">VIII. Plaintiffs believe that G.S. 115-126(d) is unconstitutional and void due to its vagueness and lack of any standard by which the Board of Education is to pattern its action in acquiring real property, and the proposed exchange is therefore also null and void in that it is an action to be taken pursuant to an unconstitutional statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">IX. Plaintiffs believe that even if G.S. 115-126(d) is constitutional, defendant's action in attempting to exchange its parcel of land for land from the Yancey farm site constitutes a manifest abuse of discretion because plaintiffs are informed and believe that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  land owned by defendant is worth approximately twice as much as the Yancey farm site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">X. Plaintiffs further believe that the defendant acted arbitrarily and in abuse of its discretion in that it knowingly used inaccurate population projection figures in reaching its determination as to the location of the school, and that as a result the great majority of the students will be required to ride a great distance to school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">XI. Plaintiffs believe they may suffer immediate irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law because the land now owned by the defendant could be transferred to an innocent purchaser for value.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the above reasons, plaintiffs prayed the court, in summary, that:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1. G.S. 115-126(d) be declared unconstitutional as being an unlawful delegation of authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2. The selection of the Yancey farm site be declared null and void as having been made arbitrarily, capriciously, and in bad faith, amounting to a manifest abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3. The consummation of the proposed exchange be permanently restrained and enjoined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">4. The court issue a preliminary injunction restraining and enjoining defendants from the consummation of the proposed exchange&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  during the pendency of this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">5. The court issue a temporary restraining order, and accept this verified complaint as an affidavit and motion for such order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">6. A jury trial be had on all issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">7. The court grant such other and further relief as it deems just and proper.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 29 August 1974, Judge McLelland granted plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the parties to appear on 5 September 1974 and show cause why the order should not be continued until final hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing oral testimony of the plaintiffs and reviewing affidavits and exhibits presented by both parties, Judge McLelland, by order dated 6 September 1974, granted plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction pending final determination of the case on its merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 23 September 1974, intervenors filed, pursuant to Rule 24 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, a motion supported by affidavits for leave to intervene.  Intervenors alleged that plaintiffs do not adequately represent the purported class and that there is no community of interest between plaintiffs and members of the class that plaintiffs purport to represent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 7 October 1974, plaintiffs filed another&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  complaint similar in many respects to the first, alleging that defendant had, on 1 October 1974, filed notice of its intention to exchange its property for a different part of the Yancey farm site, and alleging that defendant was by that action seeking to circumvent the 6 September order granting plaintiffs a preliminary injunction.  This complaint alleged the same grounds for relief as the earlier complaint, but in addition alleged that the proposed exchange would violate G.S. 115-78(c)(1), which provides that no contract for the purchase of any site shall be executed without the approval of the Board of County Commissioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on 7 October 1974, Judge McLelland granted plaintiffs' motion contained in their second complaint that they be granted a temporary restraining order, and further ordered that the parties appear on 10 October 1974 and show cause why the temporary restraining order should not be continued until final hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 17 October 1974, Judge McLelland entered an order, effective 11 October 1974, granting plaintiffs a preliminary injunction on their second complaint and consolidating the cases for the purpose of trial under Rule 42(a) of the North Carolina Rules&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Civil Procedure.  On the same date, Judge Bailey entered an order allowing the motion of intervenors to intervene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 28 October 1974, defendant filed an answer to plaintiffs' first complaint which alleged, in summary:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">I. Before the commencement of this action, on 30 November 1973, plaintiffs Peter Eggimann and Shelton Bridgers filed a class action against defendant in the Superior Court of Wake County seeking to have the selection of the Yancey farm site declared unlawful, unconstitutional and void.  One of the defenses set forth in defendant's answer was that the selection of said site constituted a reasonable exercise of discretion on the part of defendant.  Defendant's motion for summary judgment was granted in Wake County Superior Court on 28 January 1974, and the Court of Appeals affirmed in an opinion filed 17 July 1974, and reported at 22 N.C. App. 459. The North Carolina Supreme Court denied plaintiffs' petition for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">.  Since the parties and issues in this action and in the former action are the same, trial and judgment in the former action was finally dispositive of the causes of action and issues relating to the selection and value of the Yancey farm&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  site presented in this suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">II. G.S. 115-126(d) is constitutional, but in the event said statute is unconstitutional, defendant nonetheless has authority to consummate the exchange of property sought to be enjoined pursuant to the laws of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">III. G.S. 115-78(c) (1) does not apply to an exchange of real property pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 115-126(d).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">IV. Plaintiffs have failed to utilize the administrative remedy provided them in G.S. 115-87.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">V. Plaintiffs are guilty of unreasonable delay and laches in bringing this suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">VI. The selection of the Yancey farm site as the site for a comprehensive high school was made after years of study, and the selection of that site constitutes a reasonable exercise of the discretion of defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">VII. The voters of Wake County approved a bond referendum in November 1973 which would finance the construction of a high school upon the Yancey farm site.  The effect of plaintiffs' suit therefore is to challenge a political decision made by defendant and the voters of Wake County, which decision may not be the basis for a justiciable controversy.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 1 November 1974, defendant filed answer to plaintiffs' second complaint similar&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in most respects to its first answer.  Additionally, defendant alleged that plaintiff Wake County Board of Commissioners, under G.S. 153A-11 and G.S. 153A-12, lacks statutory authority to maintain the present action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on 1 November 1974, defendant moved for summary judgment in both cases.  On 13 November 1974, Judge Bailey granted defendant's motion as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;This cause coming on to be heard on the 12th day of November, 1974, before the Honorable James H. Pou Bailey, Resident Judge of the Superior Court of Wake County, North Carolina, upon motions of the defendant Wake County Board of Education for summary judgment heretofore filed in actions 74-CVS-8272 and 74-CVS-9836; and said motions being consolidated for hearing and judgment, and defendant having filed affidavits and plaintiffs having filed counter-affidavits, and all of the parties to this action having been represented by counsel who presented written and oral argument to the Court; and this cause having been heard;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;And it appearing to the Court that the Board of Education is given the power under the law to select school sites, and that the exercise of that power in a non-arbitrary, non-capricious manner without&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  a manifest abuse of discretion is not reviewable by the Courts; that N.C.G.S. 115-126(d) permits a Board of Education to exchange property in full or partial payment for property to be acquired for public school purposes and that said statute is not unconstitutional; that plaintiffs have presented no facts tending to show that defendant contrived to have population figures projected in order to justify a site selection; that there exists a statutory presumption that the action of the Wake County Board of Education was correct and that in this cause said Board of Education is entitled to said presumption of regularity and to a presumption of constitutionality; that all of the matters raised in this suit concerning the selection of the school site could have been raised in a prior suit between substantially the same parties as the instant suit, said prior suit being designated Docket No. 73-CVS-11194, and the Wake County Superior Court having rendered final judgment therein for defendant; that the Wake County Board of Commissioners is not a body corporate and may sue only in those instances expressly authorized by statute and then only in the name of Wake County and that said body is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  improperly joined in this action; and that in the instant case the wisdom of the Wake County Board of Education in selecting school sites is not before the Court;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;And The Court Finding that the records and files in this matter, including the pleadings, affidavits, evidence, exhibits, and testimony, and the record in the case of Eggimann, Et Al. v. Board of Education, 73 CVS 11194, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the defendant, Wake County Board of Education, is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Now, Therefore, It Is Hereby Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed By the Court:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;1. That the plaintiff, Wake County Board of Commissioners, is removed as a party plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;2. That N.C.G.S. 115-126(d) is declared valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;3.  That all restraining orders and injunctions entered in the actions are hereby dissolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;4.  That the plaintiffs' actions are hereby dismissed with prejudice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;5.  That the cost of the action be taxed against the plaintiffs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on 13 November 1974, Judge Bailey entered the following order reinstating the preliminary injunction:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Plaintiffs having given notice of appeal in this action, the Court, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  in the exercise of its discretion pursuant to the provisions of N.C.G.S. 1-500, orders that the preliminary injunctions rendered in 74 CVS 8272 and 74 CVS 9836 shall remain in full force and effect until said appeal can be heard; and it is further ordered that as a condition precedent to the issuance of this order, the Clerk of this Court, shall, on or before the 18th day of November, 1974, take from the plaintiffs other than the Wake County Board of Commissioners a written undertaking with sufficient sureties to be justified before and approved by the Clerk in the sum of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($ 500,000.00), to the effect that the plaintiffs will pay the party enjoined against all loss, not exceeding Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($ 500,000.00), which it may suffer on account of continuing such preliminary injunction as aforesaid, in the event that the judgment of this Court is affirmed on appeal.  In the event said undertaking is not made on or before the 18 day of November, 1974, then this order shall be null and void.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs appealed and we allowed plaintiffs' petition for appellate review in this Court prior to determination in the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Modified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff citizens sought review of the summary judgment granted by the Superior Court of Wake County (North Carolina), for defendant board of education, in citizens' suit contending that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115-126(d), which provided for the exchange of property for a school site, was unconstitutional, or alternatively that the board's action in attempting to exchange property was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court found that the citizens' claim regarding the board of education's selection of the second school property was barred by an earlier judgment involving essentially the same plaintiffs and defendants because citizens, in the exercise of a reasonable degree of diligence, should have included the allegation in the earlier litigation. The court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115-126(d) was constitutional because there was nothing in the state constitution that prohibited the board of education from exchanging land which it owned for other land for school purposes. A presumption applied that the board of education, in proposing the exchange of property, was acting in good faith and in accord with the spirit and purpose of &sect; 115-126(d), and citizens failed to overcome this presumption. The court found that &sect; 115-126(d) did not limit an exchange to property of equal value, and that if a discrepancy in valuation existed, it was only one of the factors for the trial court to consider in determining whether the board of education had abused its discretion in proposing the exchange.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified and affirmed the judgment, remanding for a hearing to determine whether the board of education abused its discretion in proposing the land exchange.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On petition of the Board of Law Examiners to rehear our per curiam decision filed 26 November 1974, reported in 286 N.C. 207, 209 S.E. 2d 457 (1974). The case was redocketed and reargued in the Supreme Court as No. 108 at Spring Term 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1972 Albert Lee Willis applied for registration before the Board of Law Examiners.  He had begun the study of law in September 1970 and anticipated taking the written portion of the Bar examination in 1973 after graduation from law school.  The applicant's answers to questions 22 and 23 of that application read:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;22. Are there any unsatisfied judgments against you?  Yes.  Balance of less than $ 200.00.  If so, give facts.  Owed on a wrecked automobile.</SPAN></P>

In 1965 I was acquitted in Baltimore City Court for driving under the influence.  In 1970 I was found guilty of driving under the influence in the District Court of Orange County, N.C.

<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">b. Have you ever been arrested, held for investigation or as a material witness?  Yes.  In Catonsville, Maryland around 1963 I was arrested as a suspect and released after about 12 hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 10 January 1973 the applicant filed application, including required certificates of moral character, with the Board of Law Examiners for admission to the 1973 Bar examination administered by said Board.  Pertinent questions and answers appear in the application as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;26. Have you ever been a party to any legal proceedings either criminal, civil or military?  If so, give facts in detail, name of action, date, court, results, etc.  (Need not list acting as counsel in military proceedings): Yes. 1969 I was found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol in Orange County District Court at Hillsboro, N.

<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">If so, give branch of service, dates of service, place and type of discharge.  U. S. Air Force 6-54 to 8-56.  Discharged under honorable conditions at Bryan Air Force Base, Texas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to Section 4 of Rule VIII of the Rules Governing Admission to the Practice of Law in the State of North Carolina, the applicant appeared before the Bar Candidate Committee for the Eighth Judicial District on 7 April 1973 for examination in regard to his moral fitness to be licensed to practice law.  Based upon matters discussed at the examination and certain &quot;evasive&quot; answers by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  petitioner to questions concerning an incident in Maryland, mentioned in his answer to question 28 above, that committee recommended further review of the applicant's moral character by the Board of Law Examiners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applicant was advised by letter that he was to appear before the Board of Law Examiners at its 24 May 1973 meeting in Raleigh for consideration of his application and &quot;in particular&quot; his moral character.  The incidents disclosed by applicant's answers to questions 26, 28 and 35 on his application and his discharge from the Air Force were enumerated topics of inquiry.  The Board requested that the applicant furnish a certified copy of his discharge and military 201 file which would explain the facts surrounding his discharge from the Air Force.  It appears the applicant received a general discharge under honorable conditions as opposed to an honorable discharge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applicant appeared before the Board of Law Examiners at the assigned time and chose to proceed without counsel.  He neglected to produce his 201 file at that meeting, stating &quot;I understand that the Air Force doesn't give out a 201 File.&quot; His testimony before the Board was transcribed and appears in the record&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  before us.  At the conclusion of the proceeding the Board of Law Examiners deferred action on petitioner's application until further facts were obtained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board obtained a copy of the applicant's Air Force 201 file and considered his application at its 22 June 1973 meeting.  Based upon evidence received in the foregoing proceedings, the Board made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;1. That the applicant enlisted in the regular Air Force in July, 1954.  The applicant was administered punishment under Article 15 of the United States Code of Military Justice in October, 1955, for dereliction in the performance of his duties in the 3530th Air Base Group Unit Mail Room and reduced to the grade of Airman Basic.  He was further administered punishment under Article 15 of the United States Code of Military Justice in May, 1956, for disobeying a lawful order issued by his First Sergeant and reduced to the grade of Airman Basic.  The record shows that the applicant was issued a general discharge from the Air Force in August, 1956, on account of continuous poor performance, indifferent attitude, lack of responsibility, immaturity and low order of intellect and potential. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2. The applicant indicated on his Application filed with the Board on January 10, 1973, in response to the question:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c14">'28. Have you ever been charged with or questioned regarding any crime, either felony or misdemeanor?  If so, give facts and details.'</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">that 'I was questioned on suspicion in Catonsville, Maryland and released without any charges around 1962.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3. In May 1964, while the applicant was living in Catonsville, Maryland, he was arrested and investigated on a charge of burglary.  Later he was charged with trespass.  The record reflects that the incident giving rise to this occurrence happened on or about May 6, 1964, when the applicant went to the home of Mrs. Carey Elizabeth Smith about 1:30 a.m., climbed on her porch and began knocking on the second floor bedroom window.  Shortly thereafter, he was arrested by the police.  He was released on bond posted by his wife.  The record shows that the applicant failed to appear at the trial at Catonsville on May 8, 1964, and his bond was forfeited, a verdict of guilty of trespassing was entered and applicant was assessed a fine in the amount of $ 28.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">4. In December, 1969, applicant was tried and convicted in Orange&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  County, North Carolina, of driving under the influence of intoxicating beverages and was granted limited driving privileges by the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">5. During the period of time applicant had limited driving privileges, he drove an automobile at a time when he was in violation of the restrictive provisions of his license and was involved in an accident in Durham County, North Carolina.  Applicant was fined in Durham County District Court for driving in violation of the terms of his driving privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">From the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Board Concludes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">That the applicant, Albert Lee Willis, has not satisfied the Board that he is possessed of good moral character and entitled to the high regard and confidence of the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the applicant's failure to satisfy the Board of his good moral character, the Board denied him the opportunity to take the 1973 North Carolina Bar Examination.  The applicant was so notified by a letter dated 27 June 1973 and signed by Fred P. Parker III, Executive Secretary of the Board of Law Examiners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, the applicant, through counsel, sought a rehearing before the full Board on grounds that he had further evidence of his good moral&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  character.  The Board refused to reconsider the applicant's character and advised him to pursue normal appeal procedures provided under the Rules Governing Admission to the Practice of Law in the State of North Carolina.  The applicant gave notice of appeal and made another request for reconsideration of his character.  The Board denied the second request stating it was &quot;without jurisdiction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applicant appealed to Wake Superior Court pursuant to Rule XIII of the Rules Governing Admission to the Practice of Law in the State of North Carolina, 279 N.C. 733, 740 (1971). His exceptions to the order and decision of the Board were that (1) Section 1 of Rule VIII of the Rules Governing Admission to the Practice of Law in the State of North Carolina is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 19 of the Constitution of North Carolina because the rule contains no ascertainable standards by which good moral character can be determined, (2) G.S. 84-24 is an unlawful delegation of legislative authority and violates Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution of North Carolina, (3) the Board's order constitutes an abuse of discretion because&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  there was insufficient evidence before the Board to support a finding of fact and conclusion that the applicant &quot;is of insufficient moral character to stand the Bar examination,&quot; and (4) the Board, &quot;motivated by racial prejudice,&quot; acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter came before Judge Henry A. McKinnon, Jr., at the January 1974 Civil Session of Wake Superior Court.  Judge McKinnon entered judgment, filed 18 March 1974, sustaining the decision of the Board of Law Examiners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applicant appealed to this Court.  The members of the Court being equally divided on the questions presented, the judgment of the superior court was thereby affirmed without becoming a precedent.  We subsequently allowed the petition of the Board of Law Examiners to rehear for the purpose of considering the constitutionality of G.S. 84-24.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant bar applicant sought review of the decision of the Wake Superior Court (North Carolina), which affirmed the decision of appellee North Carolina Board of Law Examiners denying his application to take the bar exam on the basis of the applicant's failure to satisfy the board of his good moral character.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An applicant's request to take the North Carolina Bar Exam was denied on the grounds that he had failed to satisfy the state board of bar examiners of his good moral character. The applicant was found to be less than forthcoming about his criminal convictions and his military service. The board denied the applicant's request for a rehearing, and the trial court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the character and general fitness requirement of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 84-24 and the good moral character requirement of N.C. Bar Adm. R. VIII, &sect; 4 were constitutionally permissible standards. While the applicant's past conduct did not involve moral turpitude, the traits of character and conduct evinced by his military record, including dereliction of duty as an enlisted man could not be regarded as irrelevant to the determination of his moral character for admission to the Bar. The court concluded that, when the board's findings of fact and conclusions of law were viewed in the context of the entire record, they were rationally justified by the evidence and did not result from an arbitrary, discriminatory, or capricious application of the good moral character standard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by respondent, Raleigh-Durham Airport Authority, from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Bailey, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 14 October 1974 Session of Wake, heard prior to determination by the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioning airlines, each a common carrier operating regularly scheduled flights in which it uses the facilities of the Raleigh-Durham Airport for landings and departures, complain of the action of the Airport Authority (hereinafter called the Authority) increasing landing fees and space rental charges previously in effect at the airport.  By their joint petition to the Superior Court of Wake County, they pray the court to stay the effectiveness of the new rates pending the outcome of this proceeding and to set &quot;a reasonable and adequate landing fee and space rental charge&quot; or, alternatively, to declare the rates so fixed by the Authority &quot;null and void.&quot; In summary, the petition alleges:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Authority is an agency within the meaning of G.S. 143-306(1) and is subject to the provisions of G.S. Ch. 143, Art. 33, entitled &quot;Judicial Review of Decisions of Certain Administrative Agencies.&quot; On 21 June 1973, the petitioners were notified by the Authority of an increase in the landing fees and in the space rental&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  charges, effective 1 October 1973.  The increased landing fee, applicable to the petitioners, is 262 per cent of that previously charged.  No data purporting to justify such increase in the landing fee were submitted by the Authority to the petitioners until after the Authority acted.  The Authority has never made a computation supporting the increase in the space rental charge.  The increases, both in the landing fees and in the space rental charges, are unlawful because:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) They exceed the &quot;reasonable and adequate&quot; fees and charges which the Authority is permitted by statute to charge; (2) they exceed the amount which the &quot;petitioners are contractually obligated to pay pursuant to a tenancy from year to year arising upon the expiration of the Airport-Airline Lease and Use Agreement, dated August 1, 1967&quot;; (3) they were determined upon &quot;without a meeting of the Authority and without providing the petitioners a fair opportunity to be heard; (4) they are unsupported by competent, material and substantial evidence, are arbitrary and capricious, and constitute a denial of due process of law and equal protection of the laws under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Constitution, and under Article I, &sect; 19, of the North Carolina Constitution&quot;; and (5) the &quot;statutory power of the Authority to set landing fees, and space rental charges contained in Chapter 168, &sect; 7, of the 1939 Session Laws of North Carolina, as amended, is unconstitutional for the reasons that (i) it represents an unlawful delegation of legislative authority under Article II, &sect; 1, of the North Carolina Constitution; and (ii) it is a local or special act regulating trade and is, therefore, violative of Article II, &sect; 24, of the North Carolina Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioners further allege they have exhausted all administrative remedies available to them by statute or agency rule and &quot;are entitled to judicial review of such decision under the provisions of Article 33 of Chapter 143 of the General Statutes of North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent Authority moved to dismiss the petition for review on the ground that its action in establishing the fees and charges in question is not subject to the provisions of G.S. Ch. 143, Art. 33, for the reasons that: (a) The Authority is not &quot;a State administrative agency,&quot; (b) its action in fixing the fees and charges in question is not an &quot;administrative&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  decision,&quot; and (c) there is no &quot;statute, regulation, rule or other provision&quot; requiring the Authority to follow any established administrative procedure in fixing such fees and charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Superior Court concluded that it had jurisdiction; that the respondent is an &quot;administrative agency&quot; as defined in G.S. 143-306(1); that the determination of the Authority with respect to the establishment of the landing fees in dispute was an &quot;administrative decision&quot; as defined in G.S. 143-306(2) and the petitioners' legal rights, duties and privileges were required by constitutional right to be determined after an opportunity for an agency hearing; and that the petitioners are entitled to a judicial review of such determination pursuant to G.S. Ch. 143, Art. 33.  The court, therefore, denied the motion to dismiss the petition.  From this denial the respondent Authority appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing in the Superior Court, the following facts (summarized except as otherwise indicated) were stipulated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Authority &quot;owns and operates the Raleigh-Durham Airport.&quot; Its facilities are used by scheduled air carriers, non-scheduled air carriers, military aircraft and general aviation aircraft.  The four&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  petitioners are the only &quot;scheduled air carriers&quot; using the airport.  The nonscheduled air carriers are &quot;essentially 'charter' flights by commercial airlines.&quot; &quot;General aviation aircraft&quot; are privately owned.  Two flying service companies, located at the airport, transport passengers for hire on short trips.  A consulting firm employed by the Authority projected that, &quot;during calendar year 1974,&quot; 93,577 landings would occur at the airport, of which 20.1 per cent by number and 77.6 per cent by weight would be by scheduled air carriers, 0.8 per cent by number and 3 per cent by weight would be by nonscheduled air carriers, 7.5 per cent by number and 1.8 per cent by weight would be by military aircraft and 71.6 per cent by number and 17.6 per cent by weight would be by &quot;general aviation&quot; aircraft.  &quot;The rates charged users of the Raleigh-Durham Airport facilities other than the scheduled air carriers were different in amount and determined in a manner different from the rates charged the scheduled airliners.&quot; The increases in the fees and charges were agreed upon by members of the Authority in telephone conversations without a formal meeting, following which agreement there was concurrence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  therein at a meeting of the Authority.  &quot;The petitioners were not given prior notice of the Authority's intention to set such rates * * * and the airliners have never been given a hearing, nor the opportunity for a hearing, before the Airport Authority concerning said rates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their brief on appeal, the petitioner-appellees state that after 1 October 1973 they were billed by the Authortiy on the basis of the new fees and charges but refused to pay the same and in January 1974 the petitioners began to pay, and the respondent Authority began to accept payments computed on the basis of the &quot;old&quot; rates without prejudice to the rights of either party.  The petitioners further state in their brief that a suit instituted by the respondent Authority against the petitioners Delta, Eastern and United is now pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina and a similar action against the petitioner Piedmont is now pending in the Superior Court of Wake County, each such action being for the recovery of the difference between the fees and charges computed in accordance with the increased rates and the fees and charges computed in accordance with the old&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rates.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Airport Authority (Authority) sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Wake County (North Carolina), which denied the Authority's motion to dismiss appellee airlines' action brought to challenge the Authority's increase in landing fees and space rental charges in effect at the Authority's airport. The Authority claimed its action was proprietary and was not an &quot;administrative decision&quot; subject to judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The airlines brought an action against the Authority, complaining about the Authority's increase in landing fees and space rental charges previously in effect at the Authority's airport. In response, the Authority moved to dismiss the petition for review on the ground that its action in establishing fees and charges was not subject to judicial review under N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 143, art. 33. When the superior court concluded that it had jurisdiction and denied the Authority's motion to dismiss, the Authority sought review, and the court reversed. The court held that in determining the fee it would charge for the privilege of landing an aircraft upon its runway and the rent it would charge for the use of its properties, the Authority had been acting as the proprietor of the property, not as a regulatory agency exercising a governmental function. Therefore, because the Authority's fixing of fees it would charge for the use of its property was not an &quot;administrative decision&quot; within the meaning of ch. 143, art. 33, the court held the procedure provided by ch. 143, art. 33 for obtaining judicial review of &quot;administrative decisions&quot; was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In reversing a judgment which denied the Authority's motion to dismiss the airlines' action brought to challenge the Authority's increase in landing fees and space rental charges in effect at the Authority's airport, the court held the Authority's action was proprietary and was not an &quot;administrative decision&quot; subject to judicial review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants under G.S. 7A-27(a) from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McKinnon, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 2 December 1974 Special Session of the Superior Court of Harnett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the 24 June 1974 Session, in separate bills, defendants, James Tyrone Woodson, aged 23, and Luby Waxton, aged 24, along with Leonard Maurice Tucker, aged 19, and Johnnie Lee Carroll, aged 18, were indicted under G.S. 15-144 for the murder of Mrs. Shirley Whittington Butler on 3 June 1974.  At the same time they were also indicted for the armed robbery of Mrs. Butler on 3 June 1974 and for conspiracy to commit armed robbery.  In addition, defendant Waxton was indicted for feloniously assaulting Mr. R. N. Stancil on 3 June 1974 with a .22 caliber pistol with the intent to kill him, thereby inflicting upon him serious injuries, not resulting in death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the 2 December 1974 Criminal Session, in exchange for their testimony as State's witnesses against Waxton and Woodson, the solicitor for the State dismissed the armed robbery charge against Carroll and the first-degree murder charges against both Tucker and Carroll.  Tucker was permitted to plead guilty to the armed robbery of Mrs. Butler and as an accessory after the fact to her murder.  Carroll, who&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is a half-brother of defendant Waxton, was permitted to plead guilty as an accessory after the fact to both the murder and armed robbery of Mrs. Butler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial, the State's first witnesses were several police officers, whose testimony tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 10:30 p.m. on 3 June 1974, a police officer of the City of Dunn entered the E-Z Shop on Fairground Road and found the body of Mrs. Butler, an employee of the shop, lying behind the cash register.  She had been shot through the head at close range.  The cash drawer had been removed from the register.  Lying on the counter were a pack of Kool cigarettes, a dollar bill, a pack of matches, and a box of Cracker-Jacks.  In due course, these items were collected and sent to the S.B.I., and Tucker's fingerprints were found on the pack of Kools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after the discovery of Mrs. Butler's body police headquarters received a call from Mr. Stancil, who lived just across the street from the E-Z Shop.  He reported he had been shot and requested help.  The detective who went to his assistance found him bleeding badly and immediately took him to the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Stancil testified that at about 10:15 p.m. he went to the E-Z Shop and, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as he entered, he noticed that Mrs. Butler was not in her usual place.  A person, who was leaving in a hurry, said to him something which sounded like, &quot;look out.&quot; Almost simultaneously Stancil heard an explosion and felt pain in his back.  He started toward the back of the store but, observing that blood was spurting from his arm, he went home to call for help.  A bullet had entered his back, just to the left of his spine, and lodged in his arm.  Mr. Stancil never saw Mrs. Butler, and he could not identify the person he saw leaving the shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Willie Carroll (George Willie), the brother of Johnnie Lee Carroll (Carroll) and half-brother of Waxton, testified that about 8:30 p.m. on 3 June 1974 he lent his car to his brothers; that about 10:35 p.m. they had not returned it, and he went to the police station and &quot;reported he wanted his car located.&quot; Later that night, George Willie, accompanied by Waxton, Carroll, and Tyrone Woodson, returned to the police station and reported that &quot;the boys&quot; had brought his car back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Mohiser testified that at 6:00 a.m. the next morning, June 4th, he went to the home of Waxton's mother and requested Waxton to accompany him to the police&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  station.  Waxton did so, and after 20-30 minutes Mohiser returned him to his mother's.  Immediately thereafter Waxton (so he testified later) arranged with a friend to take him and defendant Woodson to the Fayetteville airport, where they enplaned for Newark, N. J.  There they remained until June 14th when Detective Mohiser returned them to Dunn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 16 June 1974 at 3:50 p.m., Woodson gave Detective Mohiser the first statement he obtained from any of the four.  In it he implicated himself, Waxton, Tucker, and Carroll in the robbery and killing.  On the basis of the information he furnished, Carroll and Tucker were arrested.  At 7:30 p.m. on June 16th, Tucker signed a confession which implicated Woodson, Waxton, and Carroll.  On June 27th Carroll gave the officers a statement, but it was not reduced to writing and signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the time Tucker and Carroll were called as witnesses for the State, counsel for defendants objected to their competency as witnesses on the grounds that they had been indicted with Waxton and Woodson as co-conspirators and principals for the murder and robbery of Mrs. Butler and, if convicted, all would have been subject to the same punishment; that, as a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  result of &quot;negotiations and plea bargaining&quot; with the solicitor for the State, on 2 December 1974, Tucker and Carroll had been permitted to plead guilty to lesser offenses; that in consequence they were &quot;prejudicial witnesses against Waxton and Woodson,&quot; and to permit them &quot;to testify in an attempt to place the blame for the incident&quot; on defendants infringes upon defendants' right to a fair trial; and that, after permitting Tucker and Carroll to plead guilty to lesser crimes, the solicitor's election to put Woodson and Waxton on trial upon a charge for which the mandatory punishment upon conviction is death &quot;is unjust, constitutes an unequal application of the laws of the State and denies them the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by both the State and federal constitutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court, &quot;being of the opinion that the matters raised go to the weight and credibility of the witnesses and not to their competency to testify,&quot; overruled the objections to the competency of Tucker and Carroll as witnesses and permitted them to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tucker's testimony, summarized except when quoted, is briefed below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He entered pleas of guilty to the armed robbery of Mrs. Butler and to being&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an accessory after the fact to her murder in an attempt to save himself, knowing that upon these pleas he could receive sentences totaling 40 years.  He first discussed this case with the officers on June 16th, at which time he gave them a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tucker, a native of New Jersey, came to Dunn on 13 May 1974 and stayed around &quot;without any income, drinking wine, and smoking marijuana.&quot; He became acquainted with Waxton and Woodson about two weeks after his arrival in Harnett County.  On June 3rd he and Woodson spent a good part of the day drinking wine for which Woodson had paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 9:30 p.m. Waxton came to Tucker's trailer.  He inquired for Woodson, who was not there, and told Tucker to follow him.  In about three minutes Tucker walked toward Woodson's trailer, which was about a block away.  As he approached the trailer, he saw Waxton hit Woodson in the face with his hand and heard him advise Woodson that if he didn't join the group either Tucker or Waxton would kill him.  Woodson had previously told Tucker that he did not plan to take any part in the robbery.  The three men then proceeded to Waxton's trailer, where Carroll gave Woodson a towel to put over his eye.  Waxton got&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a nickel-plated Derringer pistol from a cabinet and put it in his pocket.  Tucker took Waxton's .22 automatic rifle from the couch and handed it to Woodson.  Waxton and Tucker then got in the back seat of an automobile which belonged to Carroll's brother, George Willie.  Woodson laid the gun down in the front seat of the car and got in beside Carroll, who drove the car away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waxton announced that they were going to rob the E-Z Shop.  A week earlier he had told Woodson and Tucker he was going to rob a place.  As Carroll drove by, they saw a customer entering the shop; so Carroll drove a short distance down the road and stopped.  Waxton was giving all the orders and he directed Woodson to test-fire the rifle by shooting it into the ground.  After he had done so the group then drove back to the E-Z Shop and parked.  Up until then, the plan had been that Woodson would accompany Waxton into the store, but at &quot;the last minute&quot; Waxton changed his mind and gave Woodson the duty to cover the front door.  He told Tucker to go into the store with him and instructed Woodson to stay outside &quot;and don't let nobody in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the two walked to the store Waxton told Tucker to ask for a pack of cigarettes. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the store they saw Mrs. Butler behind the counter, and Tucker asked her for a pack of Kools, which she handed to him.  Tucker paid for the cigarettes and moved down to the right of the counter.  Waxton then asked for a pack of Kools.  As Mrs. Butler handed it to him, he procured the Derringer from his back pocket and fired one shot into the left side of her head.  She fell to the floor and Waxton jumped over the counter, took the money tray out of the open cash register, and put it on the counter.  Tucker picked up the tray and started to the door.  When he reached the door he met Mr. Stancil coming in.  He told Stancil &quot;to look out&quot; and continued toward the car.  Outside, Tucker heard a second shot from inside the store.  He got into the car and Waxton &quot;came out of the store walking fast with some paper money in his hand.&quot; The four then went to the home of Waxton's mother.  There he and Tucker went into the bathroom and counted the money, about $ 280.00, which Waxton kept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the home of Waxton's mother, the four went downtown to the Shaft Inn.  George Willie was there and Carroll went with his brother to the police station.  Upon their return to the Inn, Carroll took the others&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  back to Waxton's trailer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carroll's testimony, summarized except when quoted, tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has lived in Dunn all his life.  In June 1974 he was unemployed and living with his mother.  Prior to June 3rd he had known Tucker three or four days and Woodson about six months.  His half-brother, Waxton, at age 18, left North Carolina and went to New Jersey.  Waxton returned to North Carolina in 1974 and thereafter Carroll saw him almost daily.  Waxton showed him some of the karate &quot;moves&quot; he had learned in New Jersey.  On June 3rd he and Waxton borrowed the automobile belonging to their brother George Willie, who lent it to Waxton &quot;for about 10-15 minutes.&quot; About 9:00 p.m. Carroll drove the car to Waxton's trailer.  As he approached it, he saw Waxton coming across the field with Woodson and Tucker walking behind him.  At the trailer Woodson told him that Waxton had punched him in the eye because he had been drinking, and Carroll gave him a towel to cover the eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon thereafter Woodson took a rifle from Tucker and got in the front seat with the rifle in his hand.  Both Woodson and Tucker went willingly and did whatever they did willingly.  He himself participated in the crime on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his own.  Waxton did not make him.  Carroll drove the car past the E-Z Shop and stopped on a dirt road, where Woodson got out and fired the rifle into the ground twice.  The four then drove back to the E-Z Shop.  Carroll parked the car and Waxton told Tucker to go into the store with him.  They got out of the car leaving Woodson and Carroll sitting in the front seat.  Woodson was the first to see Mr. Stancil come across the street.  He got out of the car with the rifle but Carroll pulled him back and told him to put the rifle down.  Mr. Stancil went into the store as Tucker was coming out with a cash register money tray in his hand.  Prior to that, Carroll had heard one shot fired.  After Tucker came out and the man went in, he heard one more shot.  By the time Tucker got to the car, Waxton came out running with some dollar bills in his hand.  He said, &quot;let's go,&quot; and Carroll drove the car back to his mother's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back at home Carroll took the rifle from the car and put it in the pantry.  He and Woodson sat in the living room while Tucker and Waxton went into the bathroom.  About ten minutes thereafter the four went downtown, where they met George Willie.  He and Waxton &quot;walked&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the police station and got it straight about the car.&quot; Carroll then took Waxton, Woodson, and Tucker to Waxton's trailer.  Carroll next saw Waxton about 4:00 a.m. on June 4th when he and Woodson came to his mother's house.  Waxton told Carroll to get rid of the cash tray, which he had put in the pantry, and Carroll buried it beneath his mother's house.  That morning he went with Waxton and Woodson to Fayetteville when Jethro Wynn took them to the airport.  Carroll received none of the money from the robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carroll saw Waxton and Woodson when they were brought back to North Carolina on June 14th, and he himself was arrested on June 16th.  On June 4th he had talked to Chief Cobb and had denied that Waxton had anything to do with this case.  What he told Chief Cobb on that date was untrue.  On June 16th he didn't say anything.  On June 27th he made a statement to Chief Cobb after being advised of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination Carroll testified, &quot;I made a trade to save my own life.  I am not trying to put anything on Luby [Waxton]; I'm just telling what happened.  I agreed to come up here and testify in order to save my own neck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Cobb's testimony tended&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to show that the statement which Carroll gave him on June 27th was in substantial accord with his testimony; that as a result of the information Carroll gave him, he found the money tray buried under his mother's house where he had said it was; that Carroll told him all previous statements were untrue; that he had made no notes on June 27th of the questions he asked Carroll and the answers which he gave, and Carroll signed no statement; that he had tried unsuccessfully to locate the pistol which killed Mrs. Butler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of the State's evidence defendants moved (1) to dismiss the charges against them because Tucker and Carroll had given certain testimony which did not appear in the &quot;summary of 'Statement of State's Witnesses'&quot; which the solicitor furnished counsel prior to trial; and (2) &quot;if not dismissed then, in any event, a juror be withdrawn and a new trial ordered.&quot; The Court denied these motions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the ground that the following items were not contained in the summary defendant Woodson then specifically moved to strike the statements (1) &quot;that Woodson took the gun from Tucker&quot; at Waxton's trailer; (2) &quot;that Woodson got out of the car and test-fired the rifle by shooting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it twice on the ground&quot; before the group stopped at the E-Z Shop; (3) &quot;that Woodson had a gun before, during, at and after the robbery while they were in the car&quot;; and (4) that Woodson with the gun attempted to get out of the car to stop Stancil.&quot; This motion was also denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the course of the arguments on these motions the solicitor told the court &quot;for the record that Mr. McCormick (Woodson's attorney) and [he] had had several pleading negotiation sessions&quot; and that it was his impression that Woodson would enter a plea on Monday morning along with Tucker and Carroll.  Whereupon Mr. McCormick informed the court that he had never stated to the solicitor that his client would plead guilty; that he told him he &quot;would make certain recommendations to his client&quot; Woodson, but he had &quot;consistently told the solicitor that Woodson says that he was not guilty.&quot; The solicitor's response was that although Mr. McCormick did not offer him a plea but, as a result of their discussions, it was &quot;his impression&quot; that Woodson would enter pleas in his cases just as Tucker and Carroll had done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the foregoing discussion, defendant Waxton, through his attorney, Mr. Johnson, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  requested the court's permission to make a motion in camera.  Whereupon, in the absence of the jury, and in the presence of only Judge McKinnon, defendant Woodson and his attorney, Mr. McCormick, Mr. Glen Johnson, the solicitor, the court reporter, and a deputy sheriff, defendant Waxton tendered to the State &quot;a plea of guilty to being an accessory after the fact of murder and guilty of armed robbery, the same crimes to which Tucker had pled guilty.&quot; Mr. Johnson explained to the judge and the solicitor that Waxton had said to him &quot;that he thought he was entitled to the same treatment that Tucker had received and he wanted to do the same thing Tucker had done.&quot; Whereupon the court inquired of the soilicitor, &quot;What is your position on that?&quot; and the solicitor answered, &quot;I cannot accept the pleas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each defendant testified in his own behalf and offered no other evidence.  Waxton's testimony, summarized except when quoted, tended to show:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waxton, a native of North Carolina, after living nine years in New Jersey, returned to Dunn in November 1973.  Woodson, whom he had known for eight years in New Jersey, came with him, and the two lived together in a mobile home park.  Waxton met Tucker, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  also a resident of the park, about two weeks prior to 3 June 1974.  Having &quot;talked about it and planned it in advance,&quot; Waxton, Woodson, Carroll, and Tucker had agreed to rob the E-Z Shop that night, Woodson and Carroll were unemployed.  &quot;They said they wanted money; so they were going to pull a job.  I said, 'Why not'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 9:00 p.m. on June 3rd, Waxton went looking for Woodson because Woodson &quot;knew we was going to rob the E-Z Shop.&quot; He found him at the trailer of his girl friend.  Woodson had been drinking, but he was not drunk.  An argument ensued.  &quot;He said something to disrespect me and I said something to disrespect him; so I hit him.&quot; Waxton then left without having mentioned the robbery to Woodson.  Woodson followed behind him and, when they got to Waxton's trailer, Carroll was there in George Willie's car.  Waxton owned a 1973 Pontiac and a 1963 Volkswagen, but they used George Willie's car in the robbery.  Tucker came over from another trailer and inquired if everybody was ready to go.  Everybody said Yes, and the four left in George Willie's car with Carroll driving.  Woodson had Waxton's rifle, which Waxton had said he bought &quot;to kill snakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They then drove by the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  E-Z Shop, which was only about a mile from Waxton's trailer, and went on a dirt road where Woodson insisted on testing the rifle to &quot;make sure it would fire.&quot; After he had fired it twice, they proceeded to the E-Z Shop.  Woodson and Carroll remained in the car while Waxton and Tucker went inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waxton's version of what happened inside is as follows: &quot;I was about to ask for a package of Kool cigarettes but before I spoke, Tucker asked for a package of cigarettes.  After she gave him the cigarettes he shot her.  I then jumped over the counter and started getting the money out of the cash register.  I got a handful of money and then got afraid so I started running out.  As I ran out I met Mr. Stancil and I called Tucker and told him, 'let's go, somebody is coming.' After I got a short distance from the car I heard another shot.  I didn't have any gun or weapon at any time there in the store and I didn't have any gun or weapon after I came out of the store.  When I heard the second shot Leonard [Tucker] was coming out and we both got in the car.  We were not at the Food Store more than five minutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the E-Z Shop the four went to the home of Waxton's mother, where he counted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the money in the bathroom.  There was $ 325.00 and he divided it equally.  Tucker handed the gun, a nickel-plated Derringer he had obtained overseas, to Waxton's mother and asked her to keep it for him.  Later Tucker changed his mind and took the gun with him when they left to go downtown.  There they saw George Willie, who told them he thought they had pulled a robbery.  When they denied the accusation, he asked them to accompany him to the police station.  They went and George Willie told the police he had found his car.  The next morning, after Detective Mohiser had talked to him, Waxton and Woodson took a plane to New Jersey, where they stayed until Mohiser brought them back to North Carolina.  After he and Woodson had been in the Dunn jail for &quot;a while,&quot; Waxton asked Mohiser to bring Woodson over and let him tell the detective &quot;who did the shooting.&quot; Mohiser complied with the request and &quot;brought Woodson across the hall to him&quot; and asked Woodson who did the shooting.  Woodson said Tucker had done it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waxton testified that he told the officers Tucker shot the lady but Mohiser told him he &quot;was telling something that was not true&quot;; that the officers never gave him an opportunity&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to make a statement before he took the stand; that they only listened to what Tucker, Woodson, and Carroll had to say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woodson's testimony, summarized except when quoted, tended to show: He and Waxton were good friends.  In November 1973 Waxton had brought him to North Carolina to help him escape the drug habit which he had acquired in New Jersey.  At first he had lived with Waxton or his mother and George Willie had gotten him a job.  On June 3rd Woodson was living with his girl friend.  From time to time Waxton reminded Woodson of what he had done for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waxton had &quot;mentioned&quot; the robbery to Woodson on the morning of June 2nd, but he &quot;never agreed to go along.&quot; Woodson and Tucker spent most of the day on June 3rd drinking wine which had been purchased with money Woodson's girl friend had given him.  He and Tucker had agreed that they would not be in any robbery.  That evening when Waxton found Woodson at his girl friend's trailer, Waxton cursed him and told him he was drunk.  When he told Waxton it made no difference because he was not going anywhere, Waxton hit him in the eye and said, &quot;If I don't kill you Tucker will.  Come on; let's go!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woodson was &quot;pretty high&quot; but he wasn't&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  drunk.  He knew what he was doing.  He decided to go with Waxton and followed him to his trailer.  There Tucker handed him Waxton's rifle, and he got in the car with it of his &quot;own free will.&quot; He knew there was going to be a robbery, and he knew Waxton had the Derringer.  No one forced him to go.  He does not recall testing the gun.  On the way to the E-Z Shop was the first time Waxton told him &quot;to watch the front door and not let anybody in.&quot; He might have gone in with Waxton if he had asked him.  Woodson, however, &quot;was laying back with the towel over his eye, the rifle by his side.&quot; When he heard the first shot from inside the store, he jumped up and saw Tucker coming out the door and Mr. Stancil going in, but he made no move to stop him.  Then he heard a second shot.  Tucker was outside the building and almost immediately Woodson saw Waxton emerging with paper money in his hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the E-Z Shop the four went to the home of Waxton's mother.  Waxton handed his .22 Derringer with the nickel-plated, pearl handle to his mother.  He and Tucker had the money.  They went into the bathroom and closed the door, but &quot;there was no division of the money . . . at that time.&quot; After going downtown&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and seeing George Willie, Woodson and Waxton returned to the home of Waxton's mother.  There Woodson &quot;started to mention about him shooting the woman,&quot; but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">the woman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the last word he got out of his mouth before Waxton hit him in the other eye and staggered him.  &quot;He told me never in my life to mention that woman's name again, ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next morning, after Waxton returned from the police station, he told Woodson &quot;to get a few pieces&quot; (clothes); that they were going to New Jersey.  Jethro Wynn took them to the airport and Carroll went along.  At the airport Waxton gave Woodson money from the robbery with which to buy his ticket and then balled up the rest of the money and told him &quot;to hold it.&quot; In New Jersey, at the home of Waxton's mother-in-law, he &quot;gave back all the money&quot; to Waxton.  When Woodson was later picked up, he returned to North Carolina voluntarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, in the Dunn jail, Woodson heard Waxton &quot;when he was hollering about making a confession -- he wanted to speak to Mohiser.&quot; The detective took him over &quot;in front of Waxton,&quot; who told Mohiser he knew who shot the woman and that he would tell him where the pistol was if he would pick Tucker up and lock him up. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Woodson did not make any statement at that time because he &quot;had already made [his] signed statement.&quot; He heard Waxton tell Mohiser &quot;that he did not do the shooting; that it was Leonard Tucker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to Woodson the jury returned verdicts of &quot;Guilty of Murder in the First Degree as charged,&quot; and &quot;Guilty of Armed Robbery as charged.&quot; Upon these verdicts the charge of armed robbery having been merged in the charge of first-degree murder, the court imposed only the mandatory sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to Waxton the verdicts were &quot;Guilty of Murder in the First Degree as charged,&quot; &quot;Guilty of Armed Robbery as charged,&quot; and &quot;Guilty of Assault with a Deadly Weapon with Intent to Kill Inflicting Serious Injury as charged.&quot; Upon the charge of felonious assault the court adjudged that Waxton be imprisoned for twenty years.  Upon the murder and robbery convictions, the robbery charge having been merged in the charge of first-degree murder, the court imposed the mandatory sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each defendant appealed from the sentence of death directly to this Court under G.S. 7A-27(a), and, upon Waxton's motion, we certified his appeal from the sentence imposed upon his conviction of felonious assault&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***22]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for initial appellate review by this Court under G.S. 7A-31(a).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed from a verdict in the Special Session of the Superior Court of Harnett (North Carolina), which convicted them of capital crimes and imposed death sentences. They assigned numerous errors, most of which were associated with the testimony of two co-conspirators allowed to enter guilty pleas in exchange for their testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants Waxton, Woodson, Tucker, and Carroll were charged with the armed robbery and murder of a store clerk and with conspiracy. Waxton was also indicted for feloniously assaulting a store customer. The state allowed Tucker and Carroll to enter guilty pleas on lesser offenses in exchange for their testimony against the other two, and objections to their competency were overruled. Waxton and Woodson then sought dismissal and a new trial on grounds that certain testimony did not appear in the state's summary of testimony. The court denied those motions, as well as Woodson's motion to strike the testimony. Woodson and Waxton were both found guilty and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court found no error. It held that the arguments concerning testimony omitted from the state's summaries were without merit, and that Tucker and Carroll were competent witnesses, whose testimony as co-conspirators bore upon the weight and credibility of their testimony and not upon its competency. Further, the court found that allowing the state's witnesses to enter pleas to lesser offenses did not violate Waxton's or Woodson's constitutional rights, and that the death sentences were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the death sentences were constitutional and that the trial committed no error in the admission or presentation of the testimony of co-conspirators who were allowed to enter guilty pleas to lesser offenses in exchange for their testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c1"><SPAN CLASS="c4">June 6, 1975, Filed </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal pursuant to G.S. 7A-30(1) to review decision of the Court of Appeals reported in 24 N.C. App. 338, 210 S.E. 2d 535 (1975) (opinion by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Parker, J., Britt</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Vaughn, J.J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> concurring), which found no error in defendant's convictions for inciting a riot and for engaging in a riot, but ordered a new trial on the charge of failure to comply with a lawful order to disperse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged by warrants with the above three offenses, violations respectively of G.S. 14-288.2(d), 14-288.2(b), and 14-288.5(b).  All three offenses being misdemeanor violations, defendant was first tried before McLean, D.J., at the 14 May 1973 term of Robeson County District Court.  Upon being convicted of all charges, defendant exercised his absolute right to appeal to Superior Court for trial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de novo.  See</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;G.S. 7A-290.  Defendant's cases thereafter were tried before Bailey, J. at the 9 July 1973 Session of Robeson County Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence, summarized except where quoted, tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. E. &quot;Buddy&quot; McLaurin, a local newsman, testified that on 23 March 1973 at approximately 2:00 p.m. he went to a building called the &quot;Stable&quot; in Pembroke, North Carolina, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in order to attend a press conference called by the Tuscarora Indians.  When he arrived, there were approximately fifty to sixty people in attendance, most of whom were Indians.  The following individuals were seated at tables near the front of the meeting room: Vernon Bellacord, National Head Director of the American Indian Movement; Bill Sargent, Eastern Director of the American Indian Movement; Bob Garvey, an official of the Eastern Division of the American Indian Movement; and defendant, who was known in Robeson County as Chief Brooks of the Tuscarora Tribe.  Defendant spoke to the group for approximately five minutes and reminded them of an organizational meeting scheduled for 6:45 p.m. at the Prospect School.  Defendant told the group that he had been in contact with Young Allen, Superintendent of the Robeson County Public School System, and that Allen had informed him that the Prospect School property would not be available for the meeting because of on-site construction work.  Defendant stated that he had been to the school and had observed some exterior construction work and did not think it constituted a reasonable or a prudent excuse for denying them permission to use the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  facility.  Defendant also stated, as he had done at other meetings, that he wanted the people of Robeson County to know that he was willing to die on the school steps and that if there were any &quot;riot clad armed law enforcement&quot; officers on the school grounds, they would be trespassing on Indian property and he hoped they knew what that meant.  Defendant's demeanor while speaking at the Stable was described by McLaurin as &quot;more or less matter of fact.&quot; McLaurin also added defendant made no request that anybody bring arms to the Prospect School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McLaurin further testified that he and Bill Price, another newsman, went to the Prospect School that evening at approximately 7:00 p.m. When they arrived, defendant, in a group of approximately one hundred people, was standing on the grounds of the Prospect United Methodist Church, located directly across a State paved road from the Prospect School.  McLaurin saw some forty law enforcement officers standing on the other side of the road (school grounds).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the course of the evening, McLaurin heard defendant tell certain members of the crowd on three or four different occasions not to go on the road &quot;until he made his decision.&quot; He also&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  heard defendant tell his &quot;security force&quot; to &quot;rid the area of alcoholic beverages or anything else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McLaurin observed one segment of the crowd harass law enforcement officers on several occasions.  One individual, in particular, was shining a flashlight in the eyes of the State Highway Patrolmen and telling them that they would be smiling before the night was over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 8:00 p.m. McLaurin saw a .38 caliber pistol and a machete being carried by members of the crowd.  He later heard the .38 caliber pistol discharge and also saw one shotgun and heard it discharge.  The shotgun was fired from a truck as it drove by the church yard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McLaurin stated that by 8:00 p.m. the crowd had grown from one hundred to approximately one hundred and fifty and that it was at its largest (two hundred) around 9:00 p.m. He left the area about 11:00 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State also offered the testimony of twelve law enforcement officers: four from the State Highway Patrol, seven from the Robeson County Sheriff's Department, and one from the State Bureau of Investigation.  With the exception of insignificant facts, all of the officers' testimony was basically the same.  Their combined testimony, summarized&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  except where quoted, tended to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers arrived at Prospect School on the evening of 23 March 1973 between 6:15 p.m. and 6:45 p.m. During the course of the evening, their force was composed of approximately eighteen members of the Robeson County Sheriff's Department; approximately thirty-five members of the State Highway Patrol; and approximately eight agents of the State Bureau of Investigation.  All the State Troopers and Deputy Sheriffs were clad in full riot gear, i.e., a hard helmet with a face shield, a gas mask, riot stick, and pump shotgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately seventy-five to one hundred people had assembled on the church property by 6:30 p.m. The crowd continued to grow throughout the night, reaching a maximum size of approximately two hundred sometime between 11:00 p.m. and midnight.  Defendant was present throughout the evening.  From time to time he was seen addressing the crowd from the church steps.  Due to the verbal abuses directed towards them, as well as other noises, the officers could not hear what defendant was telling the crowd.  However, when he spoke, officers could see members of the crowd &quot;stick their arms up in the air&quot; and could hear&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  them yell out &quot;Red Power.&quot; Also, during the speeches, various groups in the crowd would sing such songs as &quot;We Shall Overcome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the evening progressed the crowd became increasingly noisy and boisterous.  A bonfire was built on the church grounds and there was considerable shouting, cursing, dancing, and singing.  The officers observed several members of the crowd drinking alcoholic beverages.  From time to time, a group would start across the road and call the officers &quot;white and black m___ f___&quot;; &quot;pigs&quot;; &quot;white sons of bitches&quot;; &quot;white-eyed m___ f___&quot; and other profane and indecent names.  These groups also told the officers that if they ever got across the road, they were going to take the officers' riot sticks and guns and use them to &quot;beat the officers to death.&quot; Meanwhile, traffic on the paved State road was heavy and some passing motorists were stopped and dragged from their cars while members of the crowd beat on the hoods, sides, and trunks of their vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually, members of the crowd started throwing beer and coca-cola bottles at the officers.  The profanity and verbal insults became increasingly belligerent and violent in tone.  Members of the crowd would form&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a large group and start to come across the road toward the officers.  When this happened, defendant would call them back, telling them not to cross the road until he made his decision and that when he made his decision, they were going across to the school grounds.  Defendant also announced to the officers that if any of &quot;his people&quot; were injured, then he would &quot;declare war on Robeson County.&quot; Many officers, veterans of previous crowd control situations, testified they had never before been as frightened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers continuously observed members of the crowd armed with knives, sticks, pistols and other weapons.  At approximately 8:00 p.m. a shot was fired over by the church steps.  Shortly thereafter, a member of the crowd emerged onto the paved road and fired several pistol shots into the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometime after midnight a bottle was thrown out of the crowd.  It struck the pavement and splattered glass on some of the officers.  Just then, three shotgun blasts rang out.  They were fired in quick succession.  The pellets fell on the officers' parked vehicles.  When this occurred, sometime around 12:20 a.m., Deputy Sheriff Hubert Stone, upon the advice of other officers, issued a command&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to disperse.  Using a &quot;bullhorn,&quot; Deputy Stone told the crowd that it had five minutes in which to leave.  This directive was greeted by an increased flurry of bottle throwing.  Nevertheless, approximately twenty-five people did obey the command to disperse and left.  Others, including defendant, remained.  After waiting some five to six minutes, Deputy Stone ordered his officers to cross the road and to arrest those who had refused to comply with his command to disperse.  The officers carried out this order and arrested forty-eight men, including defendant, six women, and one boy.  Others in the crowd evaded arrest by fleeing into the darkness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A subsequent search of the area on the church side of the road led to the discovery of the following items: (1) a .22 caliber pistol; (2) a beer bottle containing amber liquid with paper stuck in its mouth; (3) a cider jug containing amber fluid; (4) a two-section iron pipe; (5) a single barrel shotgun; (6) a sawed-off shotgun; and (7) a machete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant did not offer any evidence.  He was thereafter found guilty on all charges and from judgments imposing concurrent jail sentences he appealed.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;As to &quot;Engaging in a Riot&quot; -- affirmed. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As to &quot;Inciting a Riot&quot; -- reversed and judgment arrested.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals, (North Carolina) that affirmed defendant's convictions for inciting a riot and for engaging in a riot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a leader in a Native American organization. Defendant told members that the school superintendent informed him that the organization would not be able to use school facilities because of on-site construction work. Defendant felt that the reasons provided by the superintendent were pretextual and felt that because the school was on Native American property, the organization was entitled to be there. Later that day, a riot broke out in front of the school and defendant was charged and convicted of inciting a riot and for engaging in a riot. The court affirmed the engaging in a riot, but reversed the inciting a riot conviction. The court held that the urging of three or more people to congregate at a certain location, without more, was not sufficient to convict for inciting a riot. The right of freedom of speech was not absolute and was subject to public safety concerns.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the engaging in a riot, but reversed the inciting a riot conviction against the defendant.</SPAN></P>

App. 117, 205 S.E. 2d 784 (1974) (opinion by Campbell, J., Brock, C.J., and Britt, J., concurring) which affirmed the order entered by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Exum, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, on 19 February 1974, said order denying defendant's motion for dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action instituted by plaintiff for personal injuries and for the wrongful death of plaintiff's intestate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleges that Terry Compton Sides was admitted to Cabarrus Memorial Hospital on 8 March 1971 in a pregnant condition.  Later she gave birth to a daughter and subsequent to delivery of the baby began to lose blood.  Plaintiff alleges that the hospital failed to match and cross-match Terry's blood when a transfusion was needed, and as a result, B-Positive Blood was negligently transfused into her body when her blood type was A-Negative.  Plaintiff further alleges that the doctors allowed the wrong blood type to be transfused into deceased's body and that this negligence can be imputed to the hospital.  As a result of these alleged acts, plaintiff contends that deceased suffered a &quot;transfusion reaction resulting in death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, Cabarrus Memorial Hosiptal, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  filed a motion to dismiss under the provisions of G.S. 1A-1, Rule 12(b) (1), (2) and (6), on the grounds that the court did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter; that the court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant; and that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  In support of this motion, the defendant attempted to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That the Cabarrus Memorial Hospital is a political subdivision of Cabarrus County and the State of North Carolina, having been created under the provisions of Chapter 307 of the Public-Local Laws adopted by the 1935 General Assembly of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. That the operation of the Cabarrus Memorial Hospital described in the Claim for Relief is a governmental function, and said Cabarrus Memorial Hospital, being an agency of the State of North Carolina, is immune from suit in actions of the kind and character instituted herein by the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. That the General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division, is without jurisdiction to hear and determine the plaintiff's action, for that the North Carolina Industrial Commission has been constituted a court by the General Assembly of North Carolina&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the purpose of hearing and passing upon tort claims against all departments, institutions and agencies of the State.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's motion was treated as a motion for summary judgment and was heard before Judge Exum at the 3 September 1973 Civil Session of Cabarrus County Superior Court.  On 19 February 1974 Judge Exum denied this motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals under the provisions of G.S. 1-277(b).  After considering all of defendant's contentions, the Court of Appeals held:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;The defendant Cabarrus Memorial Hospital is a county agency and is bound by the county's purchase of insurance for the defendant.  Defendant's argument that it may accept the benefit of county bonds, county taxes, use of the county treasury and treasurer and exemption from taxation as a county agency but that it may disavow the county's purchase of insurance is without merit.  Each instance merely involves a cost of doing business.  We find no error in the denial by the trial court of defendant's motion to dismiss and the denial of its motion for summary judgment.&quot; 22 N.C. App. at 122-23, 205 S.E. 2d at 788.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writ of certiorari to the North Carolina Court of Appeals was allowed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on 30 August 1974.  The case was docketed and argued as No. 70 at the 1974 Fall Term of this Court.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff brought an action for personal injuries and wrongful death against defendant hospital. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss arguing that it is immune from plaintiff's action because it was a state agency and the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter and the defendant. The trial court denied the motion and the court of appeals affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the defendant was an agency of the county and not a separate municipal agency of the state, making the defendant immune to tort liability only if it served a governmental function. The court determined that the defendant was a propriety function, not a governmental function, because the operation of a public hospital is not one of the &quot;traditional&quot; services rendered by local governmental units. Further, the court recognized that the modern trend is to restrict governmental immunity rather than extend it regarding cases of doubtful liability.</SPAN></P>

California</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 413 U.S. 15, 37 L.Ed. 2d 419, 93 S.Ct. 2607 (decided 21 June 1973).  Both motions were denied, and each defendant thereupon pleaded guilty &quot;assuming that the statute is valid and constitutional.&quot; After determining by a pre-sentence inquiry and adjudication that defendants had freely, understandingly and voluntarily pled guilty, Judge Clark sentenced each defendant to six months in prison, suspended for two years&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon the following conditions, &quot;to which the defendant gave assent: pay a fine of $ 500.00 and the costs.

He is not to engage or become employed in business of distributing obscene materials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, and that court treated the appeal as a petition for certiorari and granted the writ.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon bills of indictment proper in form charging him with (1) kidnapping and (2) raping Ruth O'Leta Kendall on 4 September 1973 in Cumberland County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruth O'Leta Kendall, a twenty-six-year-old married woman, testified that on 4 September 1973 she worked her normal hours of 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the Aetna Finance Company office located in the K-Mart Shopping Center on Bragg Boulevard in Fayetteville.  Upon leaving work about 5:15 p.m., she made a few purchases in the grocery store, returned to her car, unlocked and opened the door on the driver's side, and sat down on the seat with her right leg in the car and her left foot and leg outside.  The right door to the car was locked and could only be unlocked from the outside because the plastic button on the inside was broken off.  While in that position and in the act of placing her groceries on the seat, a man shoved a knife in her ribs and told her to move over.  &quot;He told me to keep quiet and move over or he would use the knife.  That if I did keep quiet he wouldn't hurt me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Kendall further&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testified that she moved over and the man got under the wheel.  He required her to keep her hands on her lap while he kept his right arm around her with the knife to her side.  It was a straight shift car which he steered with his left hand while she, at his command, changed gears as necessary.  The man took her out Bragg Boulevard and into a remote section of Clark's Park where he stopped the car.  He then forced Mrs. Kendall to accompany him on foot into the woods.  There, after forcing her to disrobe, he raped her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After putting on their clothes, Mrs. Kendall inquired if she would be taken back to the K-Mart and the man said, &quot;I can't let you live because you can recognize me,&quot; adding that rape was a capital offense and that he couldn't afford to go through that.  He told Mrs. Kendall he had been tried for rape in 1971 and &quot;beat the rap&quot; and couldn't go through that again.  He told her he had spent time in jail and in a mental hospital; that he had children he had to support; that she could identify him by his tattoos.  Mrs. Kendall observed that the man's front teeth were missing and that a tattoo on his left forearm said &quot;God Bless My Family&quot; and had four names, including the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  name Sharon.  On his right upper arm was an Airborne-type tattoo.  He was wearing a T-shirt, fatigue pants, and combat boots.  The man pushed Mrs. Kendall through the underbrush until they came to the Cape Fear River.  He asked her if she could swim and told her to choose between the knife and the river.  She started for the river and he pulled her back and eventually took her back to the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the way back to K-Mart he wanted to know her name and she told him.  He said he wanted her telephone number, and Mrs. Kendall wrote it on a piece of paper and gave it to him.  He told her that he wanted to have an affair with her -- &quot;he wanted to call me up and meet me later.  I told him that I would do anything he wanted; he still had the knife and I was still petrified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon arrival at the K-Mart parking lot the man talked to Mrs. Kendall for an additional ten or fifteen minutes, then got out of the car and told her to go straight home and not look back.  Mrs. Kendall drove away and noticed a white car following her until she turned into the street where she lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Kendall immediately told her husband what had occurred.  Her clothes were dirty and wet and had mud, debris and pine&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  straw on them.  The family doctor was called and the police were notified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the police arrived at her home she told them the whole story and gave a description of the man including information about the tattoos, the two missing front teeth, and the color of his hair.  She also told the officers that her assailant said &quot;he had beat a case like this in '71 where he had assaulted another lady and that he had spent time in jail and that he had spent time in a mental hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers consulted their files and ascertained that the defendant John Richard Stegmann fit, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">in minute detail</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the description given by Mrs. Kendall.  The police records further showed that defendant had been charged with rape in 1971 and acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was arrested and on the following day Mrs. Kendall identified him in a lineup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered evidence and testified as a witness in his own behalf.  He said he was twenty-four years old, married, and had three children named Johnny, Donny and Sharon.  He testified he first met Mrs. Kendall in the K-Mart Snack Bar approximately two weeks before he was arrested.  The place was crowded and he asked Mrs. Kendall if he might sit at her table where&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  she was eating lunch and she consented.  He introduced himself and she told him her name.  He told her he was in the Army, married and had children.  He asked her for her telephone number and she gave it to him there in the K-Mart Snack Bar.  The number was 867-1700 and he put it in his wallet.  On 3 September 1973 he called Mrs. Kendall and in a one-minute conversation they agreed to meet the following day when she got off work.  Accordingly, he met her on 4 September 1973 as she came out of the grocery store at the K-Mart Shopping Center.  &quot;I walked over to her and took the bags she was carrying and carried them to her car.  She then got into her car and I got in, too, and I drove away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant further testified that they drove to Clark's Park, went down the path that leads to the river to an area in the woods where they undressed and had sexual relations.  It was drizzling at the time.  While undressing &quot;everything fell out of one of the pockets in my pants,&quot; including the knife offered in evidence, and Mrs. Kendall helped pick the items up.  Defendant said he and Mrs. Kendall then dressed and drove back to the K-Mart Shopping Center where they sat and talked for fifteen&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or twenty minutes.  &quot;I then got out of the car and left.  She drove off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant emphatically denied that his small pocket knife was ever open, or that he ever threatened Mrs. Kendall, or that he ever told her he had been previously charged with rape in 1971 and beat the rap.  He admitted that his front teeth are missing and that he has tattoos on both arms, one an Airbornetype tattoo and the other with &quot;God Bless My Family&quot; and four names on it -- Sandra, Sharon, Johnny and Donny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Albert Stewart, Jr., testified that he saw Mrs. Kendall on 4 September 1973 at which time she told him she had been raped.  She appeared to be frightened but there was no evidence of any bodily injury.  Examination disclosed twigs, bits of debris, leaves and dirt adhering to her back and in the vaginal area.  There were no scratches, cuts or bruises on her body and examination of her privates revealed no cuts or bruises or lacerations of any kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arguments were transcribed and constitute part of the record on appeal.  Pertinent portions of the district attorney's argument which are assigned as error will be narrated in the opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was convicted of both charges and appeals from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a life sentence for the kidnapping and a death sentence for the rape.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;No error.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction from the Cumberland Superior Court (North Carolina) for kidnapping and rape. Defendant contended the superior court erred in admitting testimony of character witnesses to show the good character and reputation of the victim and alleged error in the admission of evidence tending to show he had been arrested for rape several years before.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for kidnapping and rape and was sentenced to a life term for the kidnapping and received a death sentence for the rape. The evidence showed that defendant approached the victim in the parking lot of a shopping center, threatened her with a knife and drove away in the victim's car to a remote area of a park where defendant raped the victim. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and concluded that the testimony of several character witnesses was admissible to show the foundation for their estimate of the victim's character and her general reputation in the community. The prosecutor was entitled to offer evidence of the victim's good character to sustain and strengthen her veracity and to counter defendant's contention that the victim had consented to the intercourse and had fabricated the alleged rape because she was afraid her husband would learn the truth about her affair with defendant. The court ruled that the evidence tending to show defendant had been arrested for rape several years back was admissible to show that defendant was the person who had raped the victim and who had made the statements to the victim concerning a similar offense in 1971.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the superior court's judgment of conviction against defendant for kidnapping and rape. The court concluded that defendant had received a fair trial free from prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 10 June 1974 Criminal Session of Nash Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon a bill of indictment, proper in form, which charged that Ernest Ray Simmons &quot;unlawfully and wilfully, feloniously and of his malice aforethought did kill and murder Mary C. Powell which said murder was committed in the perpetration of the felony crime of burglary and the attempted perpetration of the felony crime of robbery.  . . .&quot; Defendant, through his court-appointed counsel, entered a plea of not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tended to show the following facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday morning, 15 December 1973, Almeta Mills, a part-time domestic employee, went to the Powell home to work and there discovered Mrs. Powell's body on the floor near a fireplace in the front room.  She immediately went to Ned Pittman's house for help.  Pittman, who lived on Mrs. Powell's farm, went to Avent's Store and requested Mrs. Avent to notify the Nash County Sheriff's Department.  Mrs. Powell lived alone, and Ned Pittman had cut wood and placed it on her porch on the preceding Friday but did not see Mrs. Powell at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Harrison, apparently the last person to see Mrs. Powell&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  alive, testified that he went to Mrs. Powell's house on Thursday, 13 December, between four o'clock and five o'clock p.m. and talked with her at that time.  Several witnesses testified that they observed an orange-colored automobile with a light top and fluorescent stripes parked across the road from Mrs. Powell's house between the hours of 8:00 and 9:30 p.m. on the night of 13 December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. D. E. Scarborough, a physician specializing in pathology, testified that the cause of Mrs. Powell's death was hemorrhage resulting from gunshot wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmie Smith testified that he purchased and gave to Mrs. Powell a .25 caliber automatic Galese pistol and further stated that the pistol marked State's Exhibit 5 was similar to the pistol which he gave Mrs. Powell some five years prior to her death.  Ernest Richardson identified State's Exhibit 5 as the pistol which he purchased from Frank Silver, the other person charged with this crime but tried separately.  Richardson said that Silver first offered to sell him the pistol on 14 December 1973, but he and Silver could not agree on a price.  Silver returned to the Richardson home on 18 December and completed the sale.  Two or three days later&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nash County Sheriff G. O. Womble, an S.B.I. agent, and Frank Silver went to the Richardson house, and Richardson at that time gave the pistol to the S.B.I. agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martha Jones testified that defendant came to her house on the night of 13 December 1973.  Later in the evening Frank Silver, his wife, his child, his brother, and his sister came to her home in a red automobile with a white top driven by Silver.  Silver and defendant left in Silver's car, and when they returned about an hour later, defendant asked her for a shotgun.  She observed that he had been drinking and would not let him have the gun.  The two men left again but returned later in the night.  They both then left her home, and she did not see either of them again that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William D. Driver testified that he sold Frank Silver four Victory .12 gauge shotgun shells on the night of 13 December 1973.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheriff Womble testified that on 15 December 1973, along with other law enforcement officers, he went to the home of Mrs. Mary Powell, where he found her body lying in the front room in front of the fireplace.  He observed a hole in the right middle pane of the window located to the right of the front door, and glass was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  spread all over the room.  A gun wadding was found near the body.  One of the other officers discovered a spent .12 gauge gun shell in the driveway leading to the Powell house.  Over objection of defense counsel and after conducting a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> examination, Judge Webb allowed Sheriff Womble to relate to the jury certain inculpatory statements made to him by defendant.  Further facts concerning the content and admissibility of these statements appear in the opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree, and Judge Webb imposed the mandatory death sentence.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death. The evidence showed that defendant and a codefendant had murdered an elderly victim while perpetrating a burglary and attempting a robbery. Defendant contended that the trial judge committed prejudicial error in questioning prospective jurors concerning their views as to capital punishment, erred in admitting his custodial confession, erred in admitting certain evidence, and erred in his instructions to the jury regarding intoxication. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and concluded that the trial judge could, in his discretion, excuse a prospective juror who would refuse to vote for a verdict of guilty even though the state might have proved by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty. The court held that defendant's custodial confession was admissible since defendant was fully advised of his constitutional rights prior to each encounter with law enforcement officers. The court found that the evidence of the victim's weapon in the codefendant's possession was relevant and concluded that the trial judge did not err on his instructions to the jury on intoxication as a defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to review the trial before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Thornburg, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 21 January 1974 Session of Catawba Superior Court.  Defendant initially appealed, but the transcript was not available to perfect the appeal within the time allowed.  Defendant petitioned for a writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which we allowed on 8 May 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On indictments proper in form, defendant was convicted of kidnapping, rape and first degree murder, and received life imprisonment for kidnapping and the death penalty for both rape and first degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State tends to show: On Saturday, 11 August 1973, shortly after 8:30 a.m., Mrs. Paula Gail Bowman Hollar left the home of her parents where she and her husband Steven Hollar were living.  Although due at work at a photography studio in Lenoir at 9:00 a.m., she did not arrive there.  However, her 1973 yellow Pontiac was found later that day in the parking lot where she usually parked it during working hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the afternoon of 12 August, Charles B. Taylor of Lenoir was viewing some of his property on Old Mill Creek Road about three quarters of a mile from Lenoir when he found Mrs. Hollar's nude, lifeless body partially submerged in a small&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  creek nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. John Daly, the State Medical Examiner, performed an autopsy the next day.  Paula had been dead at that point between 24 and 72 hours, in his opinion.  She had abrasions and bruises on her mouth, neck, arm, back, anus, and vaginal area.  There was a three millimeter perforation of the peritoneum which, in the opinion of Dr. Daly, was a manifestation of blunt trauma in the anus.  Fresh intact spermatozoa were found in deceased's vagina.  The cause of death was blunt trauma to the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Onis Miller, who operated a service station in Lenoir, talked to defendant for about five or ten minutes between 6:30 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. on 11 August regarding repairs to defendant's automobile.  It appeared to Miller that defendant had been drinking and Miller saw a fifth-size bottle of liquor in the floorboard of defendant's automobile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Violet Price was parking at her place of employment in Lenoir at about 7:45 a.m. on 11 August when defendant pulled in beside her, got out, opened her door, and asked, &quot;What's your name?&quot; She answered, &quot;Get away from my car.&quot; Defendant then said, &quot;I'm sorry, I thought you were my wife,&quot; and drove away.  Mrs. Price was eight and one-half months&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pregnant at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Agnes Ruppert was walking to the post office about 8:40 a.m. on 11 August when defendant, in a light-green Chevrolet with a dark vinyl top, pulled into the curb and began yelling to her and motioning to her to come to him.  She recognized him since he had accompanied his wife on several occasions while his wife was being fitted for contact lenses at Mrs. Ruppert's place of employment.  Mrs. Ruppert continued to the post office and defendant drove away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Shirley Watson was parking her automobile for a visit to the beauty shop around 7:30 a.m. to 7:45 a.m. on 11 August when defendant drove into the parking lot and began staring at her.  He stared at her until she went into the beauty shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. A. F. Lupes was parked outside her house in Lenoir waiting for a girl who works for her mother at about 8:05 a.m. on 11 August when defendant stopped beside her and honked his horn.  Mrs. Lupes thought defendant wanted to enter a driveway that she was blocking so she backed up.  Defendant then pulled into a parking lot across the street and motioned for her to come to his automobile.  Mrs. Lupes drove away and came to a stop at a red stoplight down the street. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant, who had followed her, stopped his car, got out, and walked to the driver's side of Mrs. Lupes's vehicle.  He told her to stop at a parking lot and to wait for him because he wanted to talk to her.  When the light changed, she drove directly home and told her husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James L. Cline was walking in Lenoir on 11 August shortly before 9:00 a.m. As he emerged from an alley which served as a short cut to his destination, he saw the victim's Pontiac and defendant's 1967 light-green Chevrolet with a black vinyl top parked across the street in the lot where deceased's car was found.  The automobiles were about twenty feet apart.  He saw defendant with his arm around the neck of deceased.  They were about three feet from the victim's Pontiac.  Defendant took her to the Chevrolet, opened the door, and shoved her into the front seat.  Cline did not see her head above the seat after that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge A. R. Crisp was walking to the post office about 8:50 a.m. on 11 August when he heard a short blast from the horn of an automobile parked in the lot where deceased's Pontiac was found.  He saw the back of a young woman apparently being held down by someone.  At the time he was about ten feet&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  away.  He did not see any faces.  He remembered seeing only one car.  He assumed they were two youngsters &quot;carrying on,&quot; and did nothing to aid the girl at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Seagle was waiting at a red light in Lenoir shortly before 9:00 a.m. on 11 August and saw a man and woman sitting in a light-colored Pontiac at the parking lot in question.  The man's arms were around the woman.  It was the same Pontiac he had often seen parked there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jessie C. Watson was also waiting for the light near the parking lot to change &quot;somewhere before 9:00 a.m.&quot; on 11 August.  He saw a man standing beside a light-colored automobile with his right arm around a girl's neck and his left hand over her face around her mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Louise H. Wilcox was driving on Hibriten Drive about 10:20 a.m. on 11 August.  As she approached the intersection of Hibriten Drive and Old Mill Creek Road, a 1967 light-green Chevrolet approached her from the other direction in her lane of traffic.  The car was occupied by two people.  Mrs. Wilcox stopped completely and the Chevrolet turned down Old Mill Creek Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also testimony that defendant gave three rings to his wife sometime during the afternoon of 11 August. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One was an engagement ring, another was a wedding band, and another was a 1972-1973 high school ring.  Two of the rings were identified by the deceased's husband and the jeweler who sold them to him as belonging to deceased.  Defendant told his wife that he had won the rings in a poker game the night before.  The wedding and engagement rings were introduced into evidence at the trial.  The high school ring was never recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State further offered expert testimony that tended to show that certain fibers found in defendant's 1967 Chevrolet automobile matched fibers from the dress worn by the victim on 11 August, and that a portion of an identification card found in the Chevrolet matched a larger portion of the identification card found in the victim's wallet in the creek where her clothing was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's evidence tended to show that defendant was at his sister's house south of Lenoir from 7:00 a.m. to 7:40 a.m. and again about 10:00 a.m. on 11 August 1973.  That he stayed there for about fifteen minutes and seemed to be normal.  His mother saw him that afternoon and he appeared normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant did not testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other facts pertinent to decision are set out in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  opinion.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;As to the murder charges: No error.  As to the kidnapping and rape charges: Judgments arrested.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Catawba Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted defendant of kidnapping, rape, and first degree murder and which sentenced defendant to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Subsequent to his conviction, defendant argued that his rights against unreasonable search and seizure were violated and that the trial court erred in instructing the jury. Reviewing the record, the court held that the circumstances supported the seizure of defendant's vehicle. Additionally, the court held that the willing production of evidence to investigating police officers did not constitute a search for purposes of the constitutional protection. The court then held that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury as to the defense of alibi because defendant did not specifically request the instruction. However, the court held that, upon defendant's conviction for first degree murder under the state's felony murder statute, the charges of kidnapping and rape merged into the murder conviction. Thus, although the court affirmed the murder conviction and the death sentence, it arrested the judgment as to the rape and kidnapping convictions. The court also held that defendant's challenge as to the jury venire failed because he failed to use all of his peremptory challenges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for first degree murder and his death sentence. The court arrested judgment as to defendant's convictions for kidnapping and rape.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McKinnon, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 25 February 1973 Criminal Session of Wake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon an indictment, proper in form, defendant was tried on the charge of rape.  He was found guilty as charged and appeals from a sentence to death, imposed pursuant to the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State was to the following effect:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after 2:30 p.m., on 16 May 1973, the prosecuting witness, a 13 year old girl about 5 feet in height and weighing less than 90 pounds, carrying her school books, was walking along Lake Boone Trail in the City of Raleigh from her school to her home.  A red and green dump truck, loaded with dirt, stopped and the driver asked if she would like a ride to the top of the hill.  She accepted the invitation.  Upon arriving at the point where she should alight to go into her home, she told the driver she wanted to get off.  He did not stop but continued to drive on out of the city and into Umstead Park, where he turned onto a little used dirt road.  There he told the child to get out.  When she did, he seized her, put his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream and told her he would kill her if she did not stop and that if she did not permit him to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  do what he wanted, she would never go home.  He pulled her a short distance into the woods and there, over her protest, partially disrobed her and had sexual intercourse with her.  She had not previously had sexual intercourse.  She bled as the result of the penetration and also because she was then in her menstrual period.  After the completion of the sexual act, the defendant permitted her to dress, gather up her school books and get back in the truck, which she did because she was afraid and wanted to go home.  He turned the truck around, having to reverse it at least once in order to make the turn.  At some point during the ride he talked on his two-way radio but she did not understand what he said.  Driving back along Lake Boone Trail, he let her out and she went to the home of her friend, from which she telephoned her mother who was at work.  The police were called and she was taken to the hospital and examined by the doctor who corroborated her testimony concerning the penetration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that afternoon, the child gave the investigating officers a description of the truck and of the driver, her assailant.  She told them the truck had a red cab with a green body, it was loaded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with dirt and had the number 6 painted on it in silver.  At the same time, she described her assailant, the truck driver, to the officers as a white man with red, wavy hair and a lot of freckles on his face and arms, wearing a blue shirt with sleeves rolled up and having on it a name, the first three letters of which were &quot;BRY.&quot; She also told the officers that when he first picked her up he was wearing sun glasses which looked like mirrors so that she could not see his eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 16 May 1973, a construction project involving excavation and the hauling away of dirt was in progress not far from the point at which the child was picked up by her assailant.  The defendant was driving one of a number of dump trucks, each of which, in regular rotation, was loaded with dirt at the construction project, hauled the dirt away, dumped it and returned for another load, the circuit for each truck taking approximately 15 minutes.  The defendant was absent from his regular place in the truck lineup for an hour, beginning at approximately 2:35 p.m. on this afternoon, missing three loadings of the trucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that afternoon, a police officer, patrolling in his police vehicle, observed and followed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a dump truck meeting the description given by the child of the vehicle in which she had ridden.  He followed it and, by radio, arranged for a road block ahead of the truck.  It was stopped and the defendant was arrested.  On his blue shirt there was a name patch carrying his name &quot;Bryant.&quot; He has red hair.  The truck which he was driving was green with a red cab and had a white or silver 6 painted on the body.  The officers made photographs and impressions of the tire treads of the truck.  Photographs of the truck were identified by the girl, and also by a boy, who, while playing near by, observed her getting into the truck of her assailant, as being like the truck in which she rode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the afternoon of the offense, the girl was taken by the investigating officers to the police headquarters and there, in the presence of and with the consent of the defendant's then attorney, was shown a number of photographs from which she identified the photograph of the defendant as a picture of her assailant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, on the same afternoon, the investigating officers accompanied the child and her mother to the place to which she directed them as being the scene of the offense.  There they observed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the surface of the dirt road truck tire tracks which matched the tire treads on the truck driven by the defendant at the time of his arrest.  On top of one of these tire tracks was a print of a tennis shoe which, in size and tread marks, matched the tennis shoe worn by the child.  Hanging on a bush at the place where the child said the offense occurred was a pair of sunglasses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The child, testifying at the trial, positively and unequivocally identified the defendant in the courtroom as her assailant.  To this testimony there was no objection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the front tail of the shirt worn by the defendant at the time of his arrest, on the front tail of the T shirt and on the outside front of the trousers then worn by him, near the zipper, were stains identified by an expert serologist as human blood, group A.  The girl's blood was group A. The serologist did not examine a specimen of blood drawn from the defendant, but the Solicitor stipulated that the defendant's blood is also in group A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant did not testify but offered three witnesses: the bookkeeper of his employer, an employee of a tire company and the wife of the defendant.  Their testimony was to the following effect: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The defendant's wife testified that she worked in the office of the trucking company by which the defendant was employed.  They went to work together on the morning that the offense in question was committed.  At noon they went home for lunch, at which time he told her he was feeling badly.  She then noticed dark spots on his shirt which &quot;looked like blood.&quot; Two days prior to this she had observed her husband vomiting blood.  At noon on 16 May, the splotches on his shirt looked similar to the ones shown in the photograph of the defendant taken at the police station after the occurrence here in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tire company employee testified that, in response to a call, he went to the defendant's job site and fixed a flat tire on the defendant's truck, &quot;somewhere&quot; between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. on 16 May.  The defendant's truck was then at the place where dirt was being loaded into his and other trucks.  After the tire was fixed, which took about 15 or 20 minutes, the defendant pulled his truck back in the loading line and it was loaded with dirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bookkeeper for the defendant's employer testified that, about 2:30 p.m. on the day this offense was committed, the defendant called&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her on his two-way radio and said that he had a tire &quot;that was going flat.&quot; She told him to go to the filling station and put air in it and see &quot;if it would hold.&quot; This filling station was on Lake Boone Trail at about the point where the little girl was picked up by her assailant.  A few minutes after that radio call the defendant again called her on his radio saying that he was going &quot;to try to make it to the dump and unload.&quot; Shortly after 3:00 p.m., he again radioed her to ask if she had gotten in touch with &quot;the tire man&quot; and she replied that she had and the man would meet him on the job site to fix the tire.  The defendant did not state where he was at the time of this last radio call.  When this witness last saw the defendant on 16 May 1973, which was approximately 12:30 p.m., she did not observe any evidence of blood on his clothing, having no reason to look for any.  The truck the defendant was driving on that date had a silver 6 on its back and is the one portrayed in the photographs identified by the witnesses for the State as the one driven by the assailant of the girl.  The witness was unable to say where the defendant was at any particular time on 16 May 1973 after he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  left her office at 12:24 p.m. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;No error.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of Wake County (North Carolina) of rape and sentenced to death, imposed pursuant to a verdict. On appeal, he disputed the death sentence, the allowance of the solicitor to ask jury panel members questions regarding their moral or religious scruples about the death penalty, the denial of his motions for a judgment of nonsuit and for a directed verdict, and the admission of various testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raped a 13-year-old girl on May 16, 1973. On appeal, the court held that the death penalty was properly imposed under the then-existing N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-21. Although &sect; 14-21, as rewritten by 1973 N.C. Sess. Laws 1201, &sect; 2, ratified April 8, 1974, provided for first and second degree rape and the sentence for the latter crime was imprisonment, under 1973 N.C. Sess. Laws 1201, &sect; 8, the act became effective upon ratification and applied to all offenses thereafter committed. The court construed &sect; 8 as a savings clause, which left the previous version of &sect; 14-21 intact. Whether defendant's argument as to the solicitor's questions to the jury panel was directed to the trial court's permitting the solicitor to ask questions of prospective jurors, concerning their views as to the death penalty or to the trial court's sustaining of challenges for cause by reason of the responses made to such questions, the argument had no merit. The court held that the state's evidence was sufficient to convict defendant. The denial of defendant's motions for a judgment of nonsuit and for a directed verdict was not error. The challenged testimony was trivia. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. A rewritten statute did not yet apply as of the date of the rape and none of the defendant's other arguments had merit either.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Canaday, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 21 January 1974 Criminal Session of Cumberland Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon separate bills of indictment charging arson and the murders of Patricia Ellen Donlin, Christel Emmi Donlin, and Jeremiah William Donlin.  The charges were consolidated for trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State tended to show the following facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff Sergeant Jeremiah Donlin testified that on 9 October 1973, after talking with his wife, he left his home at 5107 Cannon Street, Fayetteville, about 3:10 a.m. He left his wife and his two sleeping children, Patricia Ellen Donlin, aged seven, and Jeremiah William Donlin, aged four, in the house.  His wife and children were in good health.  At that time his house had not been burned or charred in any way.  Sergeant Donlin further testified that his wife often went out alone in the evening to play Bingo at the N.C.O. Clubs at Fort Bragg.  They had &quot;at least the normal amount of marital difficulties&quot; and had sought marriage counseling on the base.  Defendant and his wife, who lived in a trailer some sixty feet behind the Donlin house on a lot separated therefrom by a fence, often baby-sat the Donlin children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Christy Sue Johnson, a next-door neighbor of the Donlins, testified that, about 7:00 a.m. on 9 October 1973, she was awakened by someone screaming &quot;fire.&quot; Upon going outside, she observed that the Donlin house was on fire, and after talking with defendant's wife, she called the fire department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Goodman, Chief of the Bonnie Doone Fire Department, testified that, at 6:58 a.m. on 9 October 1973, he received a message that a house was on fire on Cannon Street.  He arrived on the scene approximately two minutes later and discovered that the residence at 5107 Cannon Street was on fire &quot;with flames and smoke rolling out of the house through the front door.&quot; The back corner of the house had already caved in.  He encountered defendant, standing shirtless in the street in front of the house, and inquired whether people were still inside.  Defendant replied, &quot;She's in there on the couch.  She's been raped and cut open and they've set her house on fire.&quot; After calling for further assistance, Goodman returned to try to enter the house and found defendant still standing in the street and &quot;just yelling out of his head.&quot; In response to Goodman's question, defendant said that the children were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the back bedroom.  Goodman crawled towards the front door of the house and was able to see a body about eight feet within but could not enter because of the fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After controlling the fire, he and others entered the front room, where they discovered a body in roughly a kneeling position, the knees on the floor and the upper part of the body lying at an angle on the couch.  Some twenty-five or thirty minutes later firemen were able to get into the back bedroom, where they discovered the charred bodies of two children and a small dog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R. D. Cone of the State Bureau of Investigation, an expert in arson investigation and crime-scene analysis, testified that he went to the Donlin residence on 9 October 1973.  He described the burned dwelling and related that a towel, rags, parts of a gown and housecoat, a pellet or air rifle with a portion of its stock missing, a gun stock, two knives, and a pair of scissors were found in the debris.  They also obtained part of a railing from the fence separating the Donlin and Pruitt premises.  Agent Cone testified that it did not appear that accelerants were used in starting the fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Hallisey, a technician with the City-County Bureau of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Identification, testified that about 7:00 a.m. he went to the scene of the fire, where he saw defendant and asked whether any people were still in the house.  Defendant replied, &quot;There's a woman in the house, she's been raped and stabbed, and the house is burning.&quot; He also testified concerning pictures he later made of the house and the bodies therein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cuyler L. Windham, Assistant Supervisor of the Fayetteville District for the S.B.I., testified that pursuant to defendant's consent he carried defendant to the Cape Fear Valley Hospital, where blood samples and fingernail clippings were taken from defendant.  The blood samples and clippings were given to S.B.I. Agent Cone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point it was stipulated that the three victims were pronounced dead on arrival at Cape Fear Valley Hospital on 9 October 1973.  It was further stipulated that the bodies were removed from the hospital to the office of the Chief Medical Examiner of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, where Dr. Page Hudson, the State Medical Examiner, performed autopsies upon the bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laura Ward, a forensic serologist, testified that she received certain exhibits from Agent R. D. Cone and that her tests revealed the presence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Group &quot;A&quot; blood on portions of a towel, on a fatigue shirt, and on a pair of fatigue pants.  She also found evidence of blood stains on another towel, on a fabric which appeared to be a part of a nightgown, on a piece of quilted material, and on a pellet gun.  The amounts of blood on the latter items were not sufficient to allow a detailed analysis.  No blood was found on the fingernail clippings taken from defendant, the fence railing, the knives, or scissors found within the Donlin house.  Her tests disclosed that both defendant and Mrs. Donlin had Group &quot;A,&quot; Sub-group &quot;A-1&quot; blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Page Hudson, Chief Medical Examiner of North Carolina, testified that he conducted an autopsy on the body of Mrs. Donlin and the two children.  He testified that there were at least three blows by a blunt-surfaced instrument on the left side of Mrs. Donlin's face and head and one &quot;more significant&quot; blow to the right side of her face.  She had been manually strangled and stabbed three times in the abdomen and chest area with a sharp instrument.  In his opinion, her death was caused by trauma to the head, and she was dead at the time her body was burned.  In his opinion, both children died from thermal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  burns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Sergeant Conerly of the Cumberland County Sheriff's Department testified that he talked with defendant during the morning hours of 9 October 1973.  Defendant told him that, upon observing the fire in the Donlin residence about 6:45 that morning, he told his wife to call the fire department.  He then ran to the Donlin residence and attempted unsuccessfully to get into the house.  He did not know whether the children were in the house at that time.  He attempted to fight the fire until firemen arrived.  Pruitt further related that an unidentified man had also been at the scene and had told him that there was a hole in Mrs. Donlin's head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately 5:00 p.m. on the same day, Sergeant Conerly and other officers went to defendant's trailer home, and defendant consented to a search of his premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Lieutenant Charles D. Smith testified that he was present about 5:00 p.m. when defendant consented to a search of his trailer home.  At that time, the officers found army fatigues in the closet of the rear bedroom.  There were stains which appeared to be blood on the sleeves and front of the jacket and on the seat and both legs of the pants.  The fatigues were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  seized, and defendant was arrested on charges of murder and arson.  Defendant was carried to the Sheriff's Department, where he made a statement to the officers.  At this point, defendant's counsel objected and moved to suppress the statement.  The trial judge conducted a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing, and, after finding facts and concluding that the statement was made voluntarily, denied the motion to suppress.  Officer Conerly then testified before the jury as to an inculpatory statement made by defendant.  The contents of the statement and its admission into evidence will be more fully considered in the opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roy Starling, a Cumberland County Deputy Sheriff, testified that on 10 October 1973 he was a bailiff in Cumberland County District Court No. 2.  On that day he and defendant, among other persons, were in the identification room of the jail, and defendant asked him who would take him to get his clothes.  The witness testified that he told defendant he could not get his clothes because his house had burned down.  Defendant replied, &quot;No, that house belonged to the woman that I killed.&quot; This testimony was corroborated by Gerline Smith, a technician with the Identification Bureau who&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was also present and overheard this conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree as to each of the murder indictments and a verdict of guilty to the arson indictment.  Judge Canaday imposed the mandatory death sentence in each case.  Defendant appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Peel, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the February 1974 Session of Bertie Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On an indictment proper in form, defendant was tried and convicted of the first degree murder of Carlton Woodrow Barham.  Defendant appeals from a judgment imposing a sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony of Mrs. Nellie Ivy, a witness for the State, tends to show that on Saturday night, 29 September 1973, she was working part-time in Mr. Carlton Woodrow Barham's store just inside the city limits of Roxobel, N. C.  She came to work about 5:30 p.m. At about 8:30 p.m., nearing closing time, she and Mr. Barham were alone in the store.  She was standing near the cash register.  Mr. Barham was proceeding toward the cash register from the back of the store where he had turned off the television.  At this time, defendant came into the store with a hat over his hand.  He removed the hat, uncovered a pistol, and said, &quot;This is a hold-up.  Give me your money.&quot; She then told Mr. Barham, &quot;For the Lord's sake, give it to him.&quot; Mr. Barham emptied his cash register and put the money in defendant's hat, saying that was all the money he had.  Defendant ordered her and Mr. Barham out from behind the counter&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  so he could check the cash register for himself.  Defendant then took the money in the hat, started toward the door, and turned around.  She said, &quot;Please don't shoot us,&quot; at which time defendant shot at her, hitting her in the stomach.  He was seven to ten feet from her and she could see him clearly.  Defendant fired another shot over her at Mr. Barham.  She heard a total of three shots after the shot that struck her.  She also heard Mr. Barham cry out.  Defendant then left the store.  She waited until she heard a car leave and then dragged herself outside seeking help.  She identified the defendant at trial as the man who robbed the store and shot her and Mr. Barham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An autopsy conducted the following day disclosed that Mr. Barham died from massive hemorrhages in the abdominal area caused by a gunshot wound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas James Bishop testified that he is a resident of Roxobel and that on the night in question he saw a dark-colored 1963 two-door Chevrolet with an antenna on the right rear run a stoplight at a high rate of speed about a mile down the road from Barham's store.  The automobile was proceeding toward Murfreesboro.  Bishop and Joe Herman then went down to Barham's store and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  saw Mrs. Ivy lying in the yard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Sheriff Milton Morris testified that, based on Bishop's description of the automobile, the sheriff's office in Bertie County issued an alert at about 9:05 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sergeant Robert E. Harris of the Murfreesboro Police Department testified that shortly after receiving the alert, he set up a traffic check at the west end of Murfreesboro.  Within a few minutes, a car meeting the above description was sighted.  After some hesitation, the driver of the 1963 Chevrolet, who was alone, pulled over to the side of the road in response to Sergeant Harris's blue light and siren.  The defendant was the driver.  Sergeant Harris noticed that defendant was fumbling at his feet as Harris approached the driver's side of the automobile.  Defendant was unable to produce an operator's license and the registration card showed the automobile to belong to one James F. Robertson.  As Sergeant Harris was reaching for the registration card, which was located on the dash of the car, he saw the stock of a pistol protruding from beneath the seat of the automobile.  The pistol was a .38-caliber Smith and Wesson revolver with four &quot;spent&quot; cartridges and two &quot;live&quot; cartridges in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the chamber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sergeant Harris took defendant to the police station in Murfreesboro after giving him his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights.  A search there revealed eleven other &quot;live&quot; .38-caliber cartridges in defendant's right pocket and $ 136 in defendant's left pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheriff Edward H. Daniels testified that shortly before 3:00 a.m. on the morning of 30 September 1973, defendant confessed to the robbery and murder after an interrogation of about one hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special Agent Frank Satterfield of the State Bureau of Investigation testified that, in his opinion, the bullets taken from Mr. Barham's body had been fired from the revolver found in the 1963 Chevrolet driven by defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James F. Robertson testified that he was the owner of the 1963 Chevrolet driven by defendant and that it had been missing since the morning of 29 September 1973.  He further testified that he did not give anyone permission to drive it and that he never owned a revolver nor kept one in his automobile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other law enforcement officers testified at various stages of the trial for corroborative purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other facts pertinent to decision are set out in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Bertie County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted him of first degree murder and imposed a sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of first degree murder. He argued that he was deprived of his right to trial by an impartial jury when the trial court allowed the State to dismiss a juror for cause, that the trial court erred in admitting his in-custody confession, and that his constitutional and statutory rights were violated by his confinement in jail for eight days without appointment of counsel. The court found that the juror at issue displayed an unequivocal reluctance to render a guilty verdict, knowing that defendant would be subjected to the death penalty, and that her reluctance was sufficient for her dismissal for cause. Under the facts of the case, a police chief's refusal to allow defendant to use a telephone until defendant provided his name, address, and phone number was at most harmless error in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt, including an eyewitness's positive identification of him. Defendant's eight-day confinement violated neither his constitutional rights nor his rights under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7A-453, 15-47. Defendant waived those rights when he told officers that he did not need appointed counsel because he could get his own attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Direct appeal by defendant pursuant to G.S. 7A-27 (a) from his trial before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Martin, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 1 February 1974 Regular Criminal Session of Transylvania County Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried on two bills of indictment that charged him with the first-degree murders of Ruth Looker Hice and Billy Derwood Hice on 12 September 1973.  Defendant was also tried on two bills of indictment that alleged defendant &quot;did unlawfully, wilfully and feloniously conspire, agree and confederate with Lloyd McCall and Gary McCall&quot; to murder both Billy Derwood Hice and Ruth Looker Hice &quot;by concealing themselves and shooting [them] with a shotgun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The above charges, along with identical charges of conspiracy to commit murder against Gary McCall and Lloyd McCall, were consolidated for trial.  The court, in its discretion, severed from the trial two first-degree murder charges against Gary McCall and two first-degree murder charges against Lloyd McCall.  All of these charges arose out of the single occurrence described below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only evidence was that offered by the State.  Summarized, except where quoted, this evidence tended to show the following.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 12 September 1973 the decedents, Billy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Derwood Hice (hereinafter referred to as Billy) and Ruth Looker Hice (hereinafter referred to as Ruth), and the co-defendants as to the conspiracy charge, Lloyd McCall (hereinafter referred to as Lloyd) and Gary McCall (hereinafter referred to as Gary), were all living in trailer-homes adjacent to the north fork of the French Broad River in an area of Transylvania County known as &quot;Balsam Grove.&quot; The River separated this property from nearby State Highway #215.  The only method of ingress and egress was by means of a &quot;concrete bridge&quot; that crossed the River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billy and Ruth had moved into this particular section of the Balsam Grove community sometime in 1969.  At that time, access to the property was achieved by means of &quot;a little wooden bridge.&quot; Billy, apparently desiring a sturdier structure, erected the &quot;concrete bridge&quot; shortly after his acquisition of the property.  In spite of the fact that Billy had built this concrete bridge, the inference from the evidence is that all of his neighboring property owners had continuously used it, without objection, at least up until a point shortly before the incident in question.  However, from at least 14 June 1973, up until the date of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  incident, 12 September 1973, it appears that a boundary or access dispute had been brewing between Billy and Ruth and Lloyd and Gary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the date in question, Mr. Melvin Owens and his wife (hereinafter referred to as either Mr. or Mrs. Owens) were living &quot;straight across&quot; the French Broad River from Billy and Ruth, Lloyd, and Gary.  Mr. Owens was the father-in-law of Lloyd, and the grandfather of Lloyd's son, Gary.  At this point it should also be noted that defendant and Lloyd were brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Owens testified as follows regarding the events leading up to the murders of Billy and Ruth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He first saw defendant at approximately 8:00 a.m. on the day of the murder.  At that time, defendant crossed the concrete bridge in his Mustang automobile and stopped at the trailer-home of his brother, Lloyd.  Shortly thereafter, defendant and Lloyd left in defendant's Mustang.  They crossed the bridge and turned down Highway #215 in the direction of Rosman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was next seen at approximately 12:00 p.m. when he and Lloyd returned to Lloyd's trailer-home.  Thereafter, defendant drove his car down to Gary's trailer and parked it in the front yard.  Several hours later, at approximately 3:00&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  p.m., Mr. Owens, who was sitting on his front porch, observed defendant &quot;come out from behind Gary's trailer.&quot; He was holding a shotgun &quot;up to his shoulder.&quot; Defendant fired the shotgun up in the air and the force of the discharge &quot;walked him backwards between two and three steps.&quot; Mr. Owens, who had witnessed these events, began laughing &quot;about that gun akicking Lawrence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the defendant was firing the shotgun, Billy was down near the bridge area (below Gary's trailer) attempting to erect some type of swinging &quot;gate.&quot; After defendant fired the shotgun, Billy motioned for Mr. Owens to come down to where he was working.  Upon his arrival, Billy inquired as to who had fired the shotgun, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following his conversation with Mr. Owens, Billy went back up to his trailer-home in order to get some additional materials for the construction of the gate.  He returned in a few minutes and continued his work on the gate.  Apparently, &quot;things weren't a' fitting just right,&quot; so Billy once again went up to his trailer-home for materials.  At this point, defendant entered his car, drove across the bridge, and headed down Highway #215 in the direction of his home (approximately 1/4 of a mile). &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No one other than defendant came across the bridge and went down the highway at this particular time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant &quot;was gone a right smart little bit.&quot; Subsequently, he drove back up Highway #215 and slowly passed by the bridge.  A few minutes later he drove back by the bridge.  This time he approached from the opposite direction.  Defendant repeated this procedure approximately six to eight times.  Finally, he pulled off of the highway and onto the bridge.  Billy and Ruth were near the bridge, both working on the gate.  Defendant stopped his vehicle on the bridge, remained there for a couple of minutes, backed off, and then drove back down the highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after defendant had backed off the bridge, Lloyd left his trailer and got into his pickup truck.  He drove the truck down the &quot;upper driveway&quot; and struck the gate as he crossed the bridge.  The force of this blow &quot;staggered [Ruth] backwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Owens, having observed all of these events, once again walked over to the bridge area.  He told Billy and Ruth that they should stop work on the gate and go back up to their trailer-home.  During the course of this conversation, Lloyd returned and drove back across the bridge.  He&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  apparently did so without incident.  Lloyd proceeded to drive on up the hill and eventually passed by Gary's trailer.  Gary, who had been sitting in his back doorway, saw Lloyd go by and started running after the truck.  The last time Mr. Owens saw either Lloyd or Gary the pickup truck was going around a curve &quot;and Gary was just about three or four steps behind [it].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In just a few minutes defendant reappeared.  He drove his car onto the bridge near where Billy and Ruth had been working on the gate.  Both Billy and Ruth threw up their hands in an effort to stop the defendant's vehicle.  Defendant refused to stop.  His vehicle &quot;just pushed on into them,&quot; eventually knocking Ruth to the ground.  Thereafter, defendant drove to the front of Gary's trailer, got out of the car, and ran &quot;in . . . to Gary's front doorsteps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the above incident, Mr. Owens approached Billy and said: &quot;Listen here, Billy, you and Ruth quit this right now and go to the house.  From the signs and looks of everything, it's going to pitch a big 'un around here.  You get on to the house.&quot; Before Billy and Ruth could act on this advice, a gunshot rang out.  Ruth, Billy, and Mr. Owens all fell to the ground. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This occurred approximately one and one-half minutes after the defendant had forced his way across the bridge.  The gunshot came from the left window in the north end of Gary's trailer which was approximately eighty (80) feet away.  This was the trailer that the defendant had pulled up to after leaving the bridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the first shot, Billy was able to get up and to escort Mr. Owens to the edge of his nearby lawn.  Thereafter, Billy walked back across the bridge to where Ruth was lying on the ground.  At this point a second gunshot rang out.  It was not as loud as the first.  Mr. Owens, who was almost at his house, turned and looked toward the bridge (a distance of approximately two hundred feet).  He could not see either Billy or Ruth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterwards, Mr. Owens entered his residence and told his wife what had happened.  He said: &quot;I've got to get somewheres to get this blood stopped.  I'm bleeding to death, and Ruth's dead.&quot; Subsequently, he was able to get in his pickup truck and went for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr. Owens had gone for assistance, Mrs. Owens went back to the bedroom where she began watching the bridge and adjacent area.  She described the subsequent events as follows: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;[W]hile I was sitting there, I seen Lloyd's pickup come and go on up into the yard [presumably at Gary's trailer], and just after it went into the yard, I saw Lawrence's car come out from here, at the trailer, and come and go on down the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Q. Now, did Lawrence's Mustang come right by where Mrs. Hice had fell to the ground?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;A. Yes, sir, it did.  It came right by where they was at there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Q. Did it stop at any time?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;A. No, sir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Q. Did it come between the gateposts there that the Hices had been working on?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;A. He came on out the way he went in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Q. Was that between where the gateposts were?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;A. Yes, sir.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Owens also testified that she did not hear a second gunshot.  As to events occurring immediately prior to the first shot, which she heard, she stated: &quot;I saw Lawrence come up 215 and I didn't see nobody else in the car.  Lawrence's car come down in behind Gary's trailer at the front steps.  Well, in a minute and a half, I would say, the gun fired.&quot; (We note that in a prior statement given to SBI Agent Charles Chambers, Mrs. Owens estimated the time interval at eight minutes.) She also stated that she did not see anybody other than defendant leave Gary's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trailer after the shots had been fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first law enforcement officer to arrive at the scene was State Trooper Zeb Hawes.  He arrived sometime after 5:00 p.m. When he turned his vehicle into the concrete driveway adjacent to Highway #215, he saw &quot;two bodies lying in the middle of the road.&quot; The bodies were approximately twenty (20) feet from the end of the bridge; approximately two hundred (200) feet from the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Owens; approximately four hundred sixty (460) feet from Lloyd's trailer; and approximately eighty (80) feet from the left rear window in the north end of Gary's trailer.  These were the bodies of Billy and Ruth Hice.  They were both dead.  Trooper Hawes did not observe anybody else at the scene at this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. George Lacy, District Pathologist, testified that Billy Hice died from multiple gunshot wounds (twenty-one apparent wounds of entrance involving the chest, abdomen, both upper arms, head, and right knee) and specifically of one wound that penetrated the heart.  He further testified that Ruth Hice's death was caused by shotgun wounds of the chest with internal bleeding.  An examination of her body revealed two entrance wounds, one in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  posterior aspect of the chest and one in the right side of the face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several additional law enforcement officers had arrived on the scene, they commenced a search of the immediate area.  They were not able to find any weapons.  However, they did find some &quot;shotgun wadding&quot; on the ground between Gary's trailer and the two bodies.  The wadding was found approximately twenty-four (24) feet from Gary's trailer.  This wadding was later determined upon analysis to be part of an over-the-shot wadding that compared favorably with the type of wadding manufactured by the Remington Arms Company in .12 gauge shotgun shells.  Also, the search uncovered one spent shotgun shell on the ground near the trailer.  This was a .12 gauge number four buckshot shell.  This was apparently the shell from the shot defendant discharged earlier that afternoon at 3:00 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In searching the north end of Gary's trailer, officers found a one-inch hole in the left window screen.  This hole was later determined to have been made by a shotgun, the muzzle of which was three (3) inches or less from the screen at the time the shot was fired.  By looking through this screened window, officers could see the Hices' &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bodies on the roadway below.  During this search, officers also found three (3) .12 gauge Remington shotgun shells in the top dresser of the north bedroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was subsequently arrested at his home at approximately 2:30 a.m. on the morning of 13 September 1973.  He was informed of his constitutional rights.  After waiving his rights by nodding his head &quot;Yes&quot; defendant was asked: &quot;Lawrence, where is the gun that you killed Mr. and Mrs. Billy Hice with?&quot; Defendant replied: &quot;I don't have a gun; I don't own a gun.&quot; However, a subsequent &quot;consent&quot; search of defendant's residence uncovered a .12 gauge lever action Ithaca shotgun hidden beneath the quilts in the right side bedroom.  It was later discovered that this particular shotgun belonged to Keith Hensley, a son-in-law of Lloyd McCall.  Although this shotgun was introduced into evidence at defendant's trial, the State was unable to prove that any of the fatal shots were positively fired from this weapon.  However, the State did establish that a spent number four .12 gauge shotgun shell found near Gary's trailer was fired by this gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also testimony as to an alleged &quot;extra-judicial statement&quot; made by defendant during&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the course of the above residence search.  After searching the residence for a few minutes, and prior to the discovery of the .12 gauge shotgun, Officer Hubert Brown asked defendant, &quot;Why did you kill the Hices?&quot; Defendant responded: &quot;You served the warrant, you handcuffed me, that's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned guilty verdicts as to both counts of first-degree murder.  However, the jurors were unable to reach a verdict on any of the conspiracy to murder charges.  Accordingly, Judge Martin withdrew a juror and declared a mistrial as to these charges.  As to the two guilty verdicts of first-degree murder, judgment was entered sentencing defendant to death.  Defendant excepted and appealed.</SPAN></P>

The court overruled defendant's assignment of error concerning the denial of his motion for a nonsuit judgment because there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's submission of the first-degree murder issue to the jury. The court remanded the case for a new trial because the trial court erred when it admitted evidence of defendant's invocation of his constitutional right to remain silent in the face of incriminating questions by the police. The court held that the trial court failed to give a curative instruction to the jury when the prosecutor made impermissible statements concerning defendant's failure to testify and defendant's failure to deny the police's accusatory questions. The court concluded that defendant was entitled to a new trial based upon the trial court's error in admitting the challenged testimony and for the trial court's failure to properly instruct the jury with reference to the prosecutor's improper comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was convicted on trial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Superior Court on a warrant charging a violation of a zoning ordinance of the city of Winston-Salem.  The ordinance, effective 17 September 1968, prohibited operation of a building material salvage yard in specified districts, including those zoned as B-3, and allowed a grace period of three years thereafter for the removal of such business.  Defendant operates a building material salvage yard at 4131 N. Patterson Avenue in Winston-Salem within a B-3 zone contrary to the ordinance.  Section 29-11 G of the ordinance under which defendant is charged is as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;G. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">Removal of Certain Non-Conforming Uses Required</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;1. The following uses, if they are or become nonconforming by virtue of the adoption of this ordinance or of subsequent amendments thereto, shall be removed within three years after the date of adoption hereof or of such amendment:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c14">a. Auto wrecking&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  yards, building material salvage yards, general salvage yards, scrap metal processing yards, and contractors' storage yards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">b. Advertising signs in all districts except B-2, other than those advertising signs that are non-conforming only as to size or height.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant does not own the land on which his business is located, but began operation at his present location in 1966 under an oral lease.  The record does not disclose the terms of this lease.  In 1968, after the adoption of the zoning ordinance, defendant, with notice of this ordinance, entered into a written lease extending until 1979.  Upon the expiration of the three-year period following the passage of the ordinance, defendant was informed that his business violated the zoning ordinance.  He refused to remove his salvage yard.  A warrant charging defendant with a violation of the ordinance was issued on 11 May 1973.  In Superior Court defendant made a motion to quash the warrant on the grounds that the ordinance upon which it was based was unconstitutional.  This motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial defendant testified: &quot;I do not deny that I am operating a place that is nonconforming.  I know it's a B-3 zone and has&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been since 1968.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found defendant guilty.  From a sentence of 30 days imprisonment suspended for one year on the condition that defendant pay a fine of $ 50 and costs and that he discontinue the nonconforming use of the property at the end of 12 months, defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals.

Ordinance &sect; 29-11 G provided that, in the event of a building material salvage yard was located in an area zoned by the ordinance to prohibit such use, the user had a three-year grace period to remove the nonconforming use. Defendant operated a building material salvage yard contrary to the ordinance and at the end of the three-year period, he was charged with violating the ordinance. Defendant alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it deprived him of his property without due process of law and represented a taking of his property without compensation. The court affirmed the lower courts' judgments finding him guilty of violating the ordinance and held that (1) the ordinance was not so unrelated to the general welfare of the community as to be unconstitutional because it attempted to promote the community's welfare through the regulation of land use; (2) the ordinance's provisions for amortization of nonconforming uses were valid because they were reasonable; and (3) as an oral leaseholder, defendant could not have had more than a three-year vested leasehold interest in the property, so the city's interference with his rights was minimal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that at approximately 4 a.m. on 16 May 1973 Winston-Salem Police Officers Rogers and Spillman went to 1021 Sunset Drive, Apartment G, in Winston-Salem, to serve a capias on defendant Crews for failing to appear in court in a nonsupport case.  Beverly Lee Wall, who was spending the night in the apartment's living room, answered the door.  The officers asked for Crews, and she answered that he was in the back bedroom.  The officers proceeded there and turned on the overhead light.  The two defendants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were in the bed.  Miss Parrish was partially in a lying and sitting position with covers on.  Crews had awakened and was lying nude in the same bed.  The officers informed him that they had a capias for his arrest and that he was to come with them.  He put on a pair of undershorts that was lying beside the bed and proceeded into a walk-in closet to get outer clothing.  Officer Spillman followed Crews to the closet and noticed a clear, brown-tinted bottle about five inches high and two to three inches in diameter located on the front of the shelf above the clothes that were hanging in the closet.  The bottle had no writing or labels on it.  It appeared to Officer Spillman to contain pills of various colors.  Officer Spillman took Crews, and the bottle to the police station.  The bottle was found to contain several hundred amphetamines.  Police officers then procured a search warrant and returned to the apartment.  There they found several thousand more amphetamines in a pasteboard box under the bed in which defendants had been sleeping.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facts necessary to understand the questions involved on this appeal appear in the numbered paragraphs below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Abbott Laboratories, Inc. is an Illinois corporation with its principal office at North Chicago, Illinois.  Ross Laboratories is a division of Abbott Laboratories, Inc. and is operated as a separate entity with its principal office at Columbus, Ohio.  Together they constitute the &quot;taxpayer&quot; involved in this litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. At various times during the latter part of 1970 and throughout the calendar year 1971 the taxpayer shipped to Carolina Transfer and Storage Company, in carload lots by common carrier, various types and kinds of products manufactured at plants in Ohio, South Dakota and Michigan.  These products were packed in standard size cases at the plants where manufactured and the cases were sealed.  The cases are so constructed that when they are sealed and stacked they interlock so that straps, wires or other bindings are not required for storage or shipment. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The taxpayer transshipped from its inventory at Carolina Transfer and Storage Company only in case lots and in the same sealed cases which remained unbroken while in storage.  Transshipment was made by Carolina Transfer and Storage Company to the consignees of the taxpayer when and as directed by the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Each shipment made by taxpayer to Carolina Transfer and Storage Company was evidenced by an invoice and bill of lading requiring delivery of the merchandise to Carolina Transfer and Storage Company, Charlotte, North Carolina; and each such bill of lading bore either the words &quot;for transshipment&quot; or the word &quot;transshipment&quot; incribed on its face either in the space identifying Carolina Transfer and Storage Company as consignee or in the space for identity of the delivering carrier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Carolina Transfer and Storage Company is a North Carolina corporation which operates a public bonded warehouse at Charlotte and the taxpayer neither owns nor has any financial interest in or control over said business or the premises where the same is located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. During the calendar year 1971 the taxpayer gave Carolina Transfer and Storage Company specific instructions from time to time as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the type of merchandise and number of cases to be transshipped and the identity of the consignee to which such transshipments were to be made.  Pursuant to such instructions Carolina Transfer and Storage Company transshipped by common carrier to persons, firms and corporations both within and without the State of North Carolina varying numbers of cases of the taxpayer's products theretofore received and held by it for transshipment.  Purchase orders from the ultimate consignees were not held by taxpayer or Carolina Transfer and Storage Company at the time it received the taxpayer's products at its storage warehouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. As required by law, during the month of January 1971 the taxpayer reported the value of its inventory which had been shipped to Carolina Transfer and Storage Company for transshipment and which was located in said warehouse on 1 January 1971.  The taxpayer then advised the Mecklenburg Tax Supervisor that taxpayer considered such inventory to be nontaxable by reason of the provisions of G.S. 105-281 (now G.S. 105-275).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Based upon a declared and actual valuation of $ 77,405.00, Mecklenburg County assessed an ad valorem tax on the inventory for the year 1971.  The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  taxpayer appealed the assessment to the Mecklenburg Board of Equalization and Review, contending that under the provisions of G.S. 105-281 (1969) said personal property is exempt from taxation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The Mecklenburg Board of Equalization and Review at its regular meeting on 25 October 1971 upheld the contentions of the taxpayer and by order dated 8 November 1971 found as a fact and concluded as a matter of law that the property of the taxpayer stored at Carolina Transfer and Storage Company was not subject to ad valorem tax in Mecklenburg County.  The County gave timely notice of appeal to the State Board of Assessment (now the Property Tax Commission).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. By order dated 4 January 1973 the State Board of Assessment, sitting as the State Board of Equalization and Review, upheld the contentions of the taxpayer by affirming the decision of the Mecklenburg County Board of Equalization and Review exempting the property from taxation.  The County thereupon appealed to the superior court for judicial review as provided by G.S. 143-306, et seq., contending that the property is subject to taxation or, in the alternative, that G.S. 105-281 (1969), relied on by the taxpayer for exemption status, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is unconstitutional insofar as it applies to the property in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The taxpayer voluntarily became a party to the review proceedings in the superior court and the matter was heard without a jury before Judge Hasty at the 16 April 1973 Schedule A Session of Mecklenburg Superior Court.  By judgment dated 17 October 1973, Judge Hasty sustained and affirmed the decision of the State Board of Assessment, sitting as the State Board of Equalization and Review, and held specifically that (a) G.S. 105-281 (1969) is valid and constitutional, (b) the exemption of taxpayer's property from taxation as provided by G.S. 105-281 (1969) is not discriminatory in that the General Assembly is empowered to classify property for taxation and to exclude or exempt property so long as the classification is made by general law uniformly applicable throughout the State, and (c) Mecklenburg County is a governmental agency created by the General Assembly for administrative purposes, exercising only such powers and duties as are conferred upon it, and has no right as a matter of law to question the constitutionality of G.S. 105-281 (1969) under the provisions of which the property in question is exempt&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from taxation by the County.  Mecklenburg County in apt time objected and excepted to said ruling and appealed to the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the superior court, holding that taxpayer's property stored in Carolina Transfer and Storage Company's warehouse was not held &quot;for the purpose of transshipment&quot; within the meaning of that term as used in G.S. 105-281 (1969) and hence the exemption provisions of that statute are inapplicable.  The constitutional question was not reached, and whether Mecklenburg County has standing to question the constitutionality of the statute was not discussed.  We allowed the taxpayer's petition for certiorari to review that decision.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the county did not have standing to raise the constitutionality of &sect; 105-281. Because the county claimed benefits conferred by the statute, it could not question its constitutionality in order to avoid its burdens.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c1"><SPAN CLASS="c4">November 26, 1974, Filed </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This proceeding originated in January 1972 by written application and supporting affidavits filed by Albert Lee Willis before the North Carolina Board of Law Examiners for permission to take the Bar examination required of applicants for license to practice law in North Carolina.  The Board of Law Examiners, having some question whether the applicant had furnished sufficient evidence of his good moral character, notified the applicant to appear before the Bar Candidate Committee for hearing.  Some question arose with respect to the applicant's Air Force service record.  He was unable to produce his 201 file.  This file, however, was later secured by the Board of Law Examiners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After full hearing, at which the applicant and his counsel were present, the Board of Law Examiners made detailed findings of fact which are contained in the record.  The Board concluded: that the applicant, Albert Lee Willis, has not satisfied the Board that he is possessed of good moral character and entitled to the high regard and confidence of the public . . . .  Therefore, Be It Resolved by the Board of Law Examiners, that the application of Albert Lee Willis to stand the 1973 North Carolina Bar Examination&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be denied for reason that he has failed to satisfy the Board that he is possessed of good moral character and that he is entitled to the high regard and confidence of the public as required by Rule VIII of the Rules Governing Admission to the Practice of Law in The State of North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon receiving notice of the ruling, the applicant petitioned the Board for reconsideration.  This petition the Board denied.  The applicant appealed from the order to the Superior Court of Wake County contending that the rules for admission to the Bar as authorized by G.S. 84-21 and G.S. 84-24 constituted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the Board of Law Examiners and, therefore, were violative of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge McKinnon made detailed findings of fact; and on the basis thereof affirmed the decision of the Board of Law Examiners holding that G.S. 84-21 and G.S. 84-24 are constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applicant gave notice of appeal from Judge McKinnon's order and filed in the Supreme Court the record of the proceeding before the Bar examiners and before Judge McKinnon and petitioned this Court to review the entire proceeding.  The attorney for the Board of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Examiners filed a reply contending the statutes and procedures followed are constitutional and moved before this Court that the appeal be dismissed.  This Court ordered that the record and the motion to dismiss be docketed in this Court and the questions involved be calendared for argument.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an eminent domain proceeding instituted pursuant to a local act (Chapter 506, Session Laws of 1967, as it amended G.S. 160-205), wherein the City of Durham seeks to acquire real property owned by defendants for the purpose of developing a public park.  The local act permits the City of Durham to employ the &quot;quick-take&quot; procedure provided by Article 9 of Chapter 136 of the North Carolina General Statutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court dismissed the proceeding on motion of defendants for the reason that Chapter 506 of the Session Laws of 1967, under which Durham was proceeding, was repealed by Chapter 698, Session Laws of 1971 (now codified as Chapter 160A of the General Statutes).  The trial court reserved decision on the question of the constitutionality of Chapter 506.  The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court, holding that Chapter 698 of the Session Laws of 1971 did not repeal Chapter 506 when it repealed G.S. 160-205.

The court affirmed the reversal, holding that the trial court did not decide the constitutionality of ch. 506; therefore that issue was not before the court. The law relied upon by the trial court as repealing ch. 506, which was N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 160A, did not apply to city charters. 1967 N.C. Sess. Laws 506 was a local act and therefore a part of the City's charter under N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 160A. The legislative intent of ch. 160A was not to repeal local acts by implication but to save them.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiffs pursuant to G.S. 7A-30(1) from the decision of the North Carolina Court of Appeals, reported in 21 N.C. App. 102, 203 S.E. 2d 411 (1974), reversing the judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Braswell, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 9 August 1973 Session of Cumberland Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts pertinent to this appeal are as follows: On 24 July 1972, for the stated purpose of protecting the general health, safety, welfare and morals of its citizens, the City of Fayetteville adopted Section 17-14.1 of its Code of Ordinances requiring a city license &quot;for the privilege of carrying on the business, trade or profession of masseur or masseuse and for the operation or carrying on of the businesses, trade or professions commonly known as massage parlors, health salons, physical culture studios, clubs or establishments, or similar establishments by whatever name designated, wherein physical culture, massage, hydotherapy or other physical treatment of the human body is carried on or practiced.&quot; Each of the plaintiffs in this case was engaged in the business or profession of masseur or masseuse and prior to the institution of this case had been arrested for not obtaining a city license as required by Section 17-14.1. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On 3 August 1973 plaintiffs instituted this action to restrain and enjoin the enforcement of Section 17-14.1 on several grounds, one being that the city ordinance was unconstitutional.  Those portions of the ordinance to which plaintiffs pointed as rendering the ordinance unconstitutional are subsections (e), (j), and (l).  Subsections (c) and (d) set forth the requirements and procedures for applying for a license under the ordinance.  Briefly stated, these subsections require an applicant for a license to furnish to the mayor and city council &quot;written recommendations showing proof of good moral character&quot; and &quot;a health certificate from a medical doctor.&quot; Then subsection (e) -- one of the three portions of the ordinance complained of and pertinent to this appeal -- provides:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;(e) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">Issuance of License</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">.  If such application is submitted in proper form and is approved by the city council, then the city tax collector is authorized to issue a business license to such applicant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other two portions of the ordinance complained of on this appeal are as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;(j) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">Revocation of License</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">.  Whenever, in the opinion of the chief of police of the city, there is good cause&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  to revoke a license acquired hereunder, he shall submit a written recommendation of revocation, stating the reasons therefor, to the mayor and the city council, and by registered mail shall forward to the licensee a copy of his recommendation.  The city council shall thereupon be authorized to revoke such license if in its sound discretion it is deemed in the best interests of the health, safety, welfare or morals of the people of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;(l) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">Treatment of Persons of Opposite Sex Restricted</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">.  It shall be unlawful for any person holding a license under this section to treat a person of the opposite sex, except under the signed order of a licensed physician, osteopath, chiropractor, or registered physical therapist, which order shall be dated and shall specifically state the number of treatments, not to exceed ten (10).  The date and hour of each treatment given and the name of the operator shall be entered on such order by the establishment where such treatments are given and shall be subject to inspection by the police at any reaasonable time.  The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to treatments given in the residence of a patient, the office of a licensed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  physician, osteopath or registered physical therapist, chiropractor, or in a regularly established and licensed hospital or sanitarium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs also sought to restrain the enforcement of Section 17-12 of the Code of Ordinances.  This section makes it unlawful to commence business without a license when, as in this case, the business is subject to a licensing ordinance.  Following a hearing on 3 August 1973, Judge Braswell entered a temporary restraining order enjoining the defendant law enforcement officers from enforcing Sections 17-14.1 and 17-12 of the City Code.  Upon the return of the temporary restraining order, a second hearing was conducted before Judge Braswell.  Thereafter, on 20 August 1973, Judge Braswell, after noting that injunctive relief was &quot;necessary to protect plaintiffs from irreparable injury to their property rights,&quot; entered an order restraining and prohibiting the defendant law enforcement officers from enforcing or attempting to enforce Sections 17-14.1 and 17-12 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Fayetteville.  In the same judgment Judge Braswell also ruled that Section 17-14.1 and the part of Section 17-12 dealing with massage parlors were invalid&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and void, because, among other reasons, such ordinances were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his conclusions of law dealing with the constitutionality of Section 17-14.1, Judge Braswell noted that subsections (e) and (j) were unconstitutional in that they gave the chief of police and the city council the right to determine arbitrarily what is good for the public welfare, safety, health, and morals, guided only by their own ideas and not by narrow, objective, and definite standards.  Furthermore, he noted, no procedure for a hearing is provided by the ordinance for one who stood to have his license revoked, and to allow the chief of police and the city council, without guidelines or standards, to revoke a license without a hearing was a violation of the due process clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his conclusions of law dealing with subsection (l), Judge Braswell quoted with approval the following language from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">J.S.K. Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Lacey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 6 Wash. App. 43, 56, 492 P. 2d 600, 607 (1971): &quot;Because it prohibits all massagists, not licensed under one of the other healing arts, from performing massages upon the opposite sex, without a reasonable basis for such a mandate, it constitutes discrimination&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the basis of sex in contravention of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the judgment entered, defendants appealed to the North Carolina Court of Appeals.  That court, in an opinion by Judge Baley, reversed the judgment entered by Judge Braswell.  We denied </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but plaintiffs appealed to this Court pursuant to G.S. 7A-30(1).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs challenged an ordinance requiring licensing and limiting massages to patients of the same sex as the professional as unconstitutional. Plaintiffs prevailed before the trial court, but the lower court reversed the decision and upheld the ordinances. Plaintiffs sought review, and the court affirmed the lower court's decision, adopting the lower court's construction of the ordinance, which construed the questionable provisions to allow a licensee to appear before the city council and present his case before his license could be revoked. A licensee was required be notified by registered mail whenever there was a proposal to revoke his license. The city council was not permitted to deny an application for a massage license except upon reasonable grounds, and after notice and a hearing. Such interpretation rendered the licensing provisions of the ordinance entirely constitutional. The court failed to discern any discrimination whatsoever based on sex because the prohibition against massaging members of the opposite sex applied equally to both men and women.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the lower court, which construed the challenged ordinances regulating licensing of masseurs and masseuses in such a way as to render them constitutional and finding that a prohibition against massaging members of the opposite sex was not unconstitutionally discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

App. 648, 202 S.E. 2d 350.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff is a well known manufacturer of watches and other products which it sells throughout the nation to retail jewelry stores for resale.  Within this State, it sells its watches to retailers with whom it enters into a &quot;Fair Trade Agreement.&quot; By such agreement the retailer agrees not to sell or offer for sale any watch or other article, bearing the plaintiff's brand or trade name, at a price different from that shown on a retail price list compiled and furnished by the plaintiff, who reserves the right to change the listed prices from time to time.  The agreement further provides that the plaintiff agrees to employ all reasonable and lawful means, including legal action, to obtain and enforce general observance of such prices by retailers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The corporate defendants operate retail establishments selling watches, jewelry and like products in North Wilkesboro, the individual defendant being the president and principal stockholder of each such corporation. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  None of the defendants has made any contract with the plaintiff, or with any other person, restricting such defendant's right to sell any watch or other product manufactured by or bearing the brand, name or trademark of the plaintiff, or restricting such defendant's right to fix, as it may see fit, the price for which it will sell such article.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each corporate defendant, having notice of the plaintiff's &quot;Fair Trade Agreements&quot; with the various retail outlets in this State, sold at retail, for prices less than those listed by the plaintiff, watches manufactured by the plaintiff, bearing the plaintiff's brand and trade name and the retail price so listed.  The watches so sold were not purchased by such defendant from the plaintiff, but were purchased at bankruptcy sales or from various other parties.  The defendants propose to continue to offer for sale watches and other articles, bearing the plaintiff's brand or trade name, at prices less than those established by the plaintiff's &quot;Fair Trade Agreements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watches and other products manufactured by the plaintiff are sold in North Carolina in fair and open competition with like products of other manufacturers.  The plaintiff has repeatedly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  taken legal action and, by other lawful means, has consistently endeavored to prevent sales of its products at retail in North Carolina for prices less than those established by its price lists issued pursuant to its &quot;Fair Trade Agreements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties having waived trial by jury, the Superior Court found the foregoing facts, which were stipulated, and concluded that the defendants had violated the plaintiff's &quot;Fair Trade Agreement&quot; and, thereby, had violated the North Carolina Fair Trade Act and that such Act &quot;as it applies to the defendants, non-signers of any Fair Trade Agreement with the plaintiff, is constitutional under the Constitution of the State of North Carolina.&quot; Further concluding that the plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law and has been damaged by such actions of the defendants, the Superior Court entered its judgment permanently enjoining the defendants &quot;from directly or indirectly advertising, offering for sale at retail, or selling at retail the plaintiff's watches or other jewelry products bearing the plaintiff's trademarks, brands or trade names * * * at prices less than the stipulated minimum retail selling prices established by the plaintiff's fair trade&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  agreements entered into by the plaintiff with retailers of such watches and other jewelry products in the State of North Carolina * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants appealed, contending in the Court of Appeals, as they had done in the Superior Court, that the North Carolina Fair Trade Act is unconstitutional, insofar as it applies to a non-signer of such &quot;Fair Trade Agreement.&quot; In each of the lower courts they contended that the Act is a violation of the Law of the Land Clause, Article 1, &sect; 19, of the Constitution of North Carolina in that: (1) It arbitrarily limits the property rights of a retailer in a product which he has purchased and his liberty to dispose of the article as he sees fit; (2) it has no relation to the health, safety or welfare of the citizens of North Carolina, but is an unwarranted and unconstitutional use of the police power of the State to enforce an artificial price fixed by the plaintiff; and (3) it is an unconstitutional delegation to private persons, firms and corporations of the power to fix prices without any standard of administration or control by any governmental agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, relying upon </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Lilly &amp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Co. v. Saunders</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 216 N.C. 163, 4 S.E. 2d 528. From that decision the defendants appealed as a matter of right because of the constitutional question presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An affidavit by one of the plaintiff's authorized retailers, offered by the plaintiff in support of its motion in the Superior Court for summary judgment, which motion was denied, states, among other things, &quot;Bulova is the only watch manufacturer from whom I can purchase watches without fear that the watches will also be sold at discount prices in chain stores and discount houses.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff watch manufacturer filed an action against defendant retailers after the retailers sold the watch manufacturer's products at a different price from that shown on a price list furnished by the watch manufacturer. The trial court concluded that the retailers had violated the North Carolina Fair Trade Act and permanently enjoined the retailers from selling the products at different prices. The court of appeals (North Carolina) affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The watch manufacturer sold its watches to retailers with whom it entered into a fair trade agreement with, which prevented the retailer from selling the watches at a different price than that shown on a retail price list. None of the retailers in this action had made any contract with the watch manufacturer, or with any other person, that restricted the retailers' right to sell any watch or other product for a price different than that set by the watch manufacturer. The products in question were acquired primarily through bankruptcy sales. The court held that the non-signer provision of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 66-56 was unconstitutional because it delegated legislative power to a private corporation in violation of N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, and because it deprived the non-signer of liberty, contrary to the law of the land in violation of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The court determined that the products acquired by the retailers had no restrictive covenant or conditions attached. The court held that there was no public interest or property right of the watch manufacturer in its trademark which reasonably could have justified the interference with the retailers' freedom of contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Bailey, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 27 August 1973 Session Robeson Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecution upon a bill of indictment charging defendant Jimmy Britt with the first degree murder of Clarence Blackwell.  Upon his arraignment, defendant, through counsel, entered a plea of not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following is a summary of the evidence introduced at the trial.  Carl Herring, a deputy sheriff of Robeson County, testified that on 3 May 1973, at about ten o'clock p.m., Jimmy Britt came to his house and reported that Clarence Blackwell had been harassing Blackwell's estranged wife, Carolyn.  Defendant offered to give the officer $ 50 if he would &quot;lock Blackwell up.&quot; Deputy Herring told defendant that under the circumstances related to him, there was nothing he could do.  He advised defendant to go home, and told defendant that he would follow Mrs. Blackwell to work that night, and if her husband violated any law, he would place him under arrest.  Defendant then told the officer that if he (Herring) couldn't take care of it, he (Britt) could.  Britt further stated that &quot;he would take care of him and that he was not going to mess her that night like he did the night before.&quot; Later, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in response to a radio message, Deputy Herring and Deputy Sanderson proceeded to the residence occupied by Carolyn Blackwell and her children.  Upon arriving on these premises at approximately eleven o'clock, they found the body of Clarence Blackwell lying face down in the front yard.  At that time, the officers observed a wound in Blackwell's back and two wounds in the front of his body.  No weapons were found in Blackwell's automobile or near his body.  A pocket knife was found in a chair in the living room of the residence.  Officer Herring later saw defendant at the hospital where he was being treated for cuts on his hand, arm, stomach and back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Blackwell, decedent's ten year old son, testified that he was awakened by a noise on the night of 3 May 1973, and upon going into the hall, he saw defendant and his father fighting in a chair.  He saw his father run out the front door with his hands in the air, and at that time defendant fired a short gun toward the front door.  Defendant then picked up a longer gun and left.  David said that he found an open pocket knife in the living room which he recognized as his father's knife.  He closed the knife and put it under a cushion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the chair in which the two men had been fighting.  He did not see his father after he ran out the front door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Neill Watson testified that she lived next door to Mrs. Blackwell on 3 May 1973.  On that night at about ten o'clock, she saw defendant's truck and a patrol car stopped down the road.  After the patrol car left, she saw defendant's car leave and go toward town.  A few minutes later she saw defendant follow Mrs. Blackwell's automobile toward town.  They both returned in a short time and entered the Blackwell house.  Later she saw Mr. Clarence Blackwell enter the house, and in about three or four minutes Mr. Blackwell ran from the house with his hands upraised.  She heard a shot and saw Mr. Blackwell pitch from the porch into the yard.  She heard him say, &quot;Oh my God.&quot; She observed these latter occurrences from her window next to Mrs. Blackwell's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billy Ray Watson, the fifteen year old son of Mrs. Neill Watson, testified that he saw defendant's truck sitting in the driveway of their yard at about ten o'clock p.m. This driveway led to defendant's house.  At that time, a patrolman was sitting about fifty feet down the road.  Defendant left immediately after the patrolman. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He later saw Mrs. Blackwell and Jimmy Britt enter the Blackwell house at about 10:25 p.m. A short time later he heard a horn blow, and upon going into the front yard, he saw and talked with Mr. Clarence Blackwell.  The next time he saw Mr. Blackwell, he was &quot;. . . coming through the front door, he was moving fast.  His hands were being held like this.  (indicating) They were up in the air, raised.  I heard a shot.  When I heard it, Mr. Blackwell was right close to the doorsteps.  He was on the porch.  When I heard the shot, Mr. Blackwell fell forward and I heard him say, 'Oh, my God.' I didn't see him wiggle after he hit the ground.  That is basically what happened that night.&quot; He was standing at the window by his mother when he saw Mr. Blackwell run from the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Marvin Thompson, a physician specializing in pathology, testified that he performed an autopsy on the body of Clarence Blackwell.  He found an entry wound in his back and two exit wounds in his abdomen.  He was unable to say how the single bullet caused the two exit wounds but theorized that the bullet might have split.  In his opinion Clarence Blackwell died from a hemorrhage resulting from a gunshot wound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">H. L. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wiggins testified that he sold defendant a .357 magnum pistol three or four days before Clarence Blackwell was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State rested, and defendant's counsel moved for a dismissal and a directed verdict of not guilty.  The Motions were denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, Jimmy Britt, testified that on 3 May 1973, between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m. Clarence Blackwell called him and told him that he was going to kill him and Blackwell's estranged wife, Carolyn.  Defendant stated that he went to the police station where he talked to Officer Wesley Baxley.  Upon leaving the police station, he talked to an auxiliary policeman named John McLendon.  After calling Carolyn Blackwell, he went to see Deputy Sheriff Carl Herring who told him that, &quot;He couldn't go.&quot; He then went to Carolyn Blackwell's house and again called the police station.  After calling the police station, he returned to the couch where he had been sitting, and at that time Clarence Blackwell burst into the room and began cutting him.  Despite his attempts to get away, Blackwell cut him on his back, leg and stomach.  While he was being cut, he managed to reach his pistol and shoot Blackwell.  He then picked up his shotgun and left, leaving Blackwell&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  crawling out the door.  He went to the police station and from there to the hospital.  On cross-examination he admitted that he had been &quot;going with&quot; Carolyn Blackwell since March, and that he went to her house on the night of 3 May 1973, armed with a pistol and a shotgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Officer Burley Hammonds testified that he saw defendant at about ten o'clock p.m. on 3 May 1973.  Defendant told him that he was having trouble with Clarence Blackwell and asked him if it was illegal for him to carry a shotgun in his truck.  He next saw defendant at about 10:45 p.m. in the police station after defendant had been cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John D. McLendon testified that he saw defendant at about 10:00 p.m. on 3 May 1973, and Britt, at that time, told him that a man was threatening to kill him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carolyn Blackwell testified that defendant came to her house on the night of 3 May 1973, armed with a shotgun and a pistol.  While she and defendant were sitting in the living room, her husband rushed into the room.  Defendant picked up his shotgun, and she went to the back of the house.  She went to the Britt home but shortly returned and left the premises with her children.  She saw something on the ground in front of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her house as she was leaving.  On cross-examination, she admitted that she had been going with Jimmy Britt since March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Neill Watson was recalled to the stand, and she testified that she could clearly see Blackwell as he ran out of the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant rested, and the State recalled Deputy Sheriff Herring who identified a .357 magnum pistol as the weapon which he had obtained from defendant's home.  This pistol was introduced into evidence.  On cross-examination, Deputy Sheriff Herring stated:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;I have had an opportunity to examine the Watson home since Court yesterday.  It is true that the two windows of that home, on the west side nearest the highway, are boarded up.  I went to the open window on the west side of that house and stood in front of it and looked back toward the Blackwell front porch.  You can see about half the porch but I could not see the front door.  I could see the outer part of the steps but I couldn't see them right up next to the porch. . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the State and defendant rested.  Judge Bailey denied defendant's Motions for dismissal and a directed verdict of not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree, as charged&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the bill of indictment.  Defendant appealed from judgment sentencing him to death by asphyxiation.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Robeson Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted him of first degree murder and sentenced him to death by asphyxiation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of conviction and ordered a new trial. The court found that the evidence, when taken in the light most favorable to the state, was sufficient to allow a legitimate inference of premeditation and deliberation so as to require the trial court to submit murder in the first degree to the jury. The court found no error with respect to the denial of defendant's motions for judgment of dismissal, for a directed verdict of not guilty, to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial. However, the court found that it was error for the trial court to refuse to allow counsel to inquire into the moral or religious scruples, beliefs, and attitudes of the prospective jurors concerning capital punishment. Although it was not ordinarily the duty of a trial court to instruct the jury as to punishment, the court found that after it became apparent that the jurors were confused as to the law and their duties, the trial court should have informed the jury that neither the jury nor the trial court had any discretion as to punishment if a verdict of guilty of first degree murder was returned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which had convicted defendant of first degree murder. The court ordered a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to review the decision of the North Carolina Court of Appeals reported in 20 N.C. App. 505, 201 S.E. 2d 724 (1974), reversing the judgments of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Crissman, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 9 April 1973 Regular Criminal Session of Guilford Superior Court, Greensboro Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was initially tried in Guilford District Court upon four separate warrants, each of which charged that on or about 22 February 1973 defendant<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;did unlawfully, wilfully, aid and abet in the act of indecent exposure by knowingly allowing and permitting [naming one of the four females involved] to expose her private parts at the Rathskeller, 716 West Market Street, Greensboro, N. C., a public place, and did allow this premises which he has control over to be used for the purpose of such an act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;The offense charged here was committed against the peace and dignity of the State and in violation of law G.S. 14-190.9.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">District Court Judge Elreta M. Alexander found defendant guilty on all four counts, and from judgments pronounced defendant appealed to Guilford Superior Court, where defendant was tried </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> upon the same warrants.  The jury returned verdicts of guilty on all four counts, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and from judgments imposed defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals.  That court reversed.  We allowed the State's petition for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on 5 March 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that on the evening of 22 February 1973 four detectives of the Greensboro Police Department Vice Division went to the Rathskeller, a Greensboro night club operated by defendant.  Signs at the entrance to the Rathskeller read &quot;Bottomless dancing, nightly,&quot; and &quot;Topless dancing, nightly.&quot; Another sign read, &quot;This is a private club.  Membership is open to anyone willing to abide by house rules.  If the nude body offends you, please don't enter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detectives entered the premises and found defendant standing behind a cash register near the entrance.  Defendant informed the detectives that the admission fee was $ 5 and that &quot;the girls would take it all off.&quot; Each detective signed a note pad, paid $ 5, and was then admitted.  Defendant did not tell them that the Rathskeller was a private club or that they were becoming members by paying $ 5, nor did he indicate that by paying $ 5 they were entitled to anything other than admission on that particular evening.  They received no membership card&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or other indicia of membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detectives proceeded to the street-level area of the premises and were seated.  For approximately thirty minutes two females danced topless on a raised stage in front of the detectives and some seventy-five other male customers.  Then defendant announced that the show was starting downstairs.  The customers, including the detectives, went downstairs into a large room.  There they observed four females dancing one at a time on a raised stage.  While dancing the four females completely disrobed before the audience.  Part of their routine is illustrated by the testimony of Officer Heffinger, one of the detectives from the Vice Division:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Then, Sandra Faye Hall danced again.  During the dance, she took off her purple pants.  She had no clothing on at all.  She got down on the floor on her hands and knees and rotated her hips. . . .  After this, Miss Hall turned with her feet toward the audience, her head toward the back of the stage.  She was on her back, and she separated her legs, raising the lower portion of her body and began rotating her hips, during which I could see the public area, the vagina lips of her body.  She stayed in that position&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  15 to 30 seconds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other three females went through a somewhat similar routine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the show, the detectives identified themselves and arrested the girls for indecent exposure.  Defendant was also placed under arrest for aiding and abetting indecent exposure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant did not testify or offer any evidence.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Modified and affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state appealed the order of the Court of Appeals Court (North Carolina), which reversed the convictions of defendant for four counts of aiding and abetting the act of indecent exposure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant owned a night club that offered nude dancing as entertainment. A sign stated that the night club was a private club. Police officers paid a fee at the door but were not informed that the fee was a membership fee and were not given a membership card. The police officers observed four dancers dancing nude and arrested defendant and the dancers. Defendant was convicted in the district court and appealed to the superior court for a trial de novo. Before the trial in the superior court, defendant moved to quash the warrants charging defendant with the crime. The motion was denied. Defendant appealed to the appellate court, which reversed the superior court on the ground that the indecent exposure statute was unconstitutional. The state appealed. The court found that the ruling of the appellate court was correct, but on different grounds. The court found that the warrants were facially defective as they failed to state that the exposure was before persons of the opposite sex. However, the court stated, in dicta, that the statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court that reversed the convictions of defendant for aiding and abetting indecent exposure, but modified the order to reflect a different reason, and remanded the cases to the appellate court, so that it could subsequently remand the cases to the superior court for further action by the state.</SPAN></P>

The petition requested that the court issue a citation notifying the respondent to appear in court and show cause, if any he has, why he should not be adjudged an habitual offender whose motor vehicle license should not be revoked as provided in G.S. 20-220-231.  The citation, with the petition and conviction record attached, was served on the respondent on May 7, 1973.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent filed answer on May 21, 1973, alleging, &quot;That the Statute under which the State of North Carolina purports to act is unconstitutional.&quot; The respondent moved to dismiss the proceeding for that it was criminal in nature, denied the respondent the right of a jury trial and subjected him to double jeopardy and additional punishment for offenses for which he had already been tried and convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 7, 1973, Judge Perry Martin conducted a hearing and entered the following judgment:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;This Cause coming&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  on to be heard and being heard before the undersigned Judge of Superior Court at the June, 1973, Session upon the Petition of F. Ogden Parker, Solicitor, Eighth Solicitorial District, and upon the call of said case, the Court having considered the Petition of the State, the evidence presented for the State, and having considered Defendant's motion to dismiss said action, deems that the Statute under which the Solicitor is attempting to proceed is unconstitutional;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;It is Now, Therefore, Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that said Statute be, and the same is hereby declared unconstitutional, in that it violates the United States Constitution and the North Carolina Constitution, and it is further ordered that this action be, and the same is hereby dismissed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Attorney General for the State excepted to the order and gave notice of appeal.  The North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed the decision and remanded the proceeding to the Superior Court of Lenoir County for hearing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent driver appealed from a decision of the COURT OF APPEALS OF NORTH CAROLINA reversing the superior court's judgment, which dismissed the license revocation proceeding instituted against the driver pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-220-231 and declared that that the statute was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 20-220-231 permitted the revocation of the motor vehicle license of a person adjudged to be a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, the State of North Carolina, instituted a proceeding in the superior court requesting that a citation be issued notifying the driver to appear in court and show cause why he should not be adjudged a habitual offender whose license should not be revoked. The driver answered, claiming that &sect; 20-220-231 was unconstitutional on the ground that it was criminal in nature and that it denied him the right to a jury trial and subjected him to double jeopardy and additional punishment for offenses for which he had been found guilty. The superior court declared the statute unconstitutional and dismissed the proceeding. The State sought review, and the court of appeals reversed the superior court's judgment and remanded for hearing. On appeal, the court affirmed, noting that license revocation proceedings were civil, not criminal, in nature and that the operation of a motor vehicle was a privilege not a right. The court held that a revocation proceeding was not intended to punish the offender but, rather, to remove from the highway one who was a potential danger to himself and other travelers. Thus, the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was tried upon a bill of indictment charging him with first degree burglary and rape of Judith Ann Strader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to his trial, defendant was represented by Mr. Wiley P. Wooten, who was appointed by the court on 20 June 1973.  Thereafter defendant employed Mr. Fred Darlington, III, of the Alamance County Bar to represent him on these charges, and by Order dated 9 August 1973 Mr. Wooten was relieved of further responsibilities as court-appointed counsel.  Prior to his discharge, Mr. Wooten had obtained an Order committing defendant to Cherry Hospital for sixty days for observation and determination of his competency to stand trial upon the pending charges.  The Court was furnished with the diagnostic conference and discharge summary, signed by Dr. Eugene V. Maynard, of the Cherry Hospital Staff, which stated that examination, observation and testing performed at Cherry Hospital revealed no evidence of insanity or any serious mental disorder which might interfere with defendant's competency to stand trial upon the charges of first degree burglary and rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon his arraignment defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entered a plea of not guilty to both charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence, in substance, discloses the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judith Ann Strader testified that she was employed as a teacher by the Burlington City School system.  On the night of 18 June 1973, she returned to her mobile home in Terrywood Mobile Home Park at about 9:30 p.m. after attending a ceramics class in Burlington.  She lived in a 65 foot mobile home which contained two bedrooms, a living room, dining room and kitchen.  The master bedroom is at one end of the mobile home and the kitchen is at the other end.  The living room is located between the kitchen and master bedroom and the front door of the mobile home enters into the living room.  There is a back door to the kitchen and a back door entering the hall next to the bathroom serving the master bedroom.  After visiting a neighbor, she locked the doors of the mobile home, undressed and put on a robe.  She lay down on her bed in the master bedroom between 10:30 and 10:45 p.m. and dropped off to sleep.  She had planned to get up and straighten the kitchen and had therefore left the lights on in the living room.  There were three Duke Power night-lights located near her trailer. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One light was near the front of the mobile home, one was near the rear of the trailer and one light was across the street so that it shone almost directly into her bedroom window.  The moon was about half full on this night.  She was awakened by the barking of her Pekinese dog, and when she sat up in the bed, she saw a man standing in the doorway of her bedroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point the Solicitor asked if the man she saw on that night was in the courtroom.  Defendant's counsel objected and asked to be heard.  After a voir dire hearing, the trial judge overruled defendant's objection and motion to suppress.  (We will hereafter more fully discuss the voir dire hearing and the resulting ruling by the trial judge.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned to the courtroom and Judith Ann Strader identified defendant as her assailant.  She further testified:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;When I was aroused by my dog, I saw the man standing in the doorway of my bedroom and I raised up on my arms and looked and first I felt shocked and then he lunged at me.  I was struggling to get away, and I screamed two or three times, I am not sure, and I screamed and when I did he hit me with his fist in my face and bruised my upper face and forehead, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  my eyes, the side of my face and my lip and I kept struggling the best I knew how to get away and at this time he started choking me.  He didn't say anything at all at that time.  He choked me almost to the point I felt all the air and everything going out of my body, and he pushed me up in the bed and at this time he did rape me, keeping one hand at my neck part of the time and my body was penned down.  My body was penned down.  The defendant's private parts entered my private parts.  I didn't give consent for him to have intercourse with me.  I didn't give the defendant or any other person consent or permission to come into my mobile home that night.  . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Strader further stated that defendant remained in her trailer for nearly an hour, and upon the pretext of quieting her barking dog she managed to escape and flee to a nearby trailer occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Don Hall.  The Halls summoned law enforcement officers, and after she talked to them she was carried to the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Elizabeth Hall testified that in the early morning hours of 19 June 1973, Judith Strader came to her mobile home in a hysterical condition.  Miss Strader told her that there was a man in her&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trailer and that he had raped her.  Mrs. Hall said that at that time she looked out the window and saw a beige colored 1964 Chevelle automobile with a dent in the side and back fender.  The automobile was being operated by a male person.  She had previously seen defendant drive this car.  Mrs. Hall testified that there was a knot and a bruise over Judith Strader's right eye, a bruise on her left eye, red marks on her throat and that her lip was swollen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. James Little of the Alamance County Sheriff's Department testified that in response to a call he went to Judith Ann Strader's mobile home.  The only person there was Mr. Don Hall.  He found the bedroom &quot;torn up,&quot; the bedspread on the floor and blood on the sheets and pillow case.  He talked to Miss Strader at about 1:30 a.m. on 19 June 1973.  The statement made to him by Miss Strader was admitted into evidence under a proper limiting instruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. James Andrews of the Alamance County Sheriff's Department testified that as a result of a call, he stopped defendant at about 1:30 a.m. on 19 June 1973 on Highway 49 near Haw River.  Defendant was operating a 1964 light colored Chevelle with a damaged back fender.  At his request, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant accompanied him to the Alamance County Sheriff's Department where Officer Talbert advised defendant of his Constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kenneth Talbert of the Alamance County Sheriff's Department stated that he talked with defendant during the early morning hours of 19 June 1973.  After advising defendant of his rights he began to question him, but defendant said that he did not wish to answer any questions until he had contacted an attorney.  However defendant agreed to an inspection of his clothing, and Mr. Talbert found two blond hairs about 12 to 18 inches in length on defendant's clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State rested and defendant's motions as of nonsuit as to both charges were denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, testifying in his own behalf, stated that he lived with his wife and two children in a mobile home in Terrywood Park.  His daughter had sandy blond hair.  He had seen Judith Strader, who was acquainted with his wife, around the trailer park.  On 18 June 1973 he worked until about 4:00 p.m. for Alcar Tree Company.  On that day, he wore a long-sleeved work shirt, trousers and laced-up boots.  Upon leaving work, he went to his mother's home in Graham for a short visit, then to the ABC store&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Graham where he purchased a pint of vodka.  He then went to Dean Bonding Company where he had a drink, then to Mebane where he drank two beers, then into Caswell County where he took another drink of vodka, then returned to Mebane where he drank three beers, then to Hillsborough where he had two beers.  He started to Burlington on Highway I-85, and he was stopped at about 8:30 p.m. and cited for speeding 80 mph in a 65 mph zone.  From there he proceeded to Gus' Drive-In on Highway 54 between Burlington and Graham where he drank more beer.  He then went to a cafe for more beer.  He left the cafe at about 11:00 p.m. and returned to Gus' Drive-In where he remained until about midnight.  He returned to Highway I-85 and left that highway at the Haw River Exit where he stopped and called his wife from a telephone booth.  After talking to her for 15 to 25 minutes, he proceeded through and beyond Haw River, North Carolina, on Highway 49 where he was stopped by a police officer.  He did not go back to Terrywood Mobile Home Park after he left there at about 6:00 a.m. on the morning of the 18th.  The scratches on his arms were caused by his tree cutting work.  He had been convicted of assault&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with intent to commit rape in 1969.  He could not remember the number of assault charges for which he had been convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon completion of defendant's testimony, both the State and defendant rested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned verdicts of guilty of first degree burglary and rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge pronounced judgment sentencing Alton James Henderson to death by asphyxiation.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant assigned as error the admission, over his objection, of the in-court identification testimony by the victim; the denial of his motions for judgment as of nonsuit as to the charges of first degree burglary and rape; and the jury instructions. He argued that the testimony was tainted by an out-of-court identification that violated U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV in that the identification was conducted in the absence of counsel and was impermissibly suggestive and conducive to mistaken identification. The court held that under the totality of the circumstances, the in-court identification of defendant was not tainted by the out-of-court confrontation because the trial court determined on voir dire that the in-court identification was of independent origin. There was ample evidence from which the jury could have reasonably inferred that there was a &quot;breaking&quot; within the meaning of the term as used in reference to first degree burglary. There was ample evidence of both physical force and overpowering coercion and fear to help the jury determine whether defendant obtained carnal knowledge of the victim forcibly and against her will. The jury instructions were proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant's conviction and death sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warrants for the arrest of defendants were issued 28 September 1971.  The affidavit portion of the warrant against Joe Bryant (Bryant) reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The undersigned, G. C. Hager, being duly sworn, complains and says that at and in the County named above and on or about the 10th day of September, 1971, the defendant named above did unlawfully, willfully, and did intentionally disseminate obscenity in a public place, to wit: The Adult Book Center, 407 North Tryon Street, Charlotte, N. C., in that he did provide obscene 8mm motion picture, did exhibit and make available 8mm motion pictures, and did rent and sell and provide obscene motion picture 8mm film which with the representation, embodiment, performance and publication of the obscene, and that the said 8mm motion picture film did show actual acts of sexual intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus performed by and between human males and human females.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The offense charged here was committed against the peace and dignity of the State and in violation of law G.S. 14-190.1.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The affidavit portion of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the warrant against Raymond Mitchell Floyd (Floyd) is identical to that against Bryant except that the word &quot;allow&quot; appears instead of the word &quot;provide&quot; as the fifth word after the words &quot;Charlotte, N.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants were first tried, found guilty and sentenced in the District Court of Mecklenburg County.  Upon appeal, the cases were consolidated for trial and tried </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the 6 March 1972 Session of Mecklenburg County Superior Court.

This Court, on motion of the Attorney General, dismissed defendants' appeal and also denied certiorari.  Defendants then filed a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States for a review of the decision of the Court of Appeals.  On 25 June 1973, the Supreme Court of the United States granted defendants' petition for writ of certiorari, vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanded the case to the Court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Appeals &quot;for further consideration in light of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miller v.

The court rejected these arguments and affirmed the convictions. The court found that the pornography sold and rented by defendants was obscene material under any formulation for defining the term and that the conduct of defendants as charged in the warrants and as established by the verdicts constituted violations of &sect; 14-190.1. The court also held that defendants were fully aware that the hard-core pornography that they disseminated constituted obscene material of the grossest character. The court further found that the warrants gave defendants full and explicit notice that the obscene material on which these prosecutions are based was hard-core pornography.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon a bill of indictment, proper in form, charging that on 4 March 1973, with malice aforethought, he did kill and murder Peggy Ann Bryant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered evidence tending to show that on the night of 4 March 1973 defendant was at King's Lounge, a Raleigh tavern.  The deceased Peggy Ann Bryant, defendant's girl friend, arrived in an auto with her two sisters and two other girls.  Peggy called defendant to the car where an argument ensued following which defendant went back into the tavern.  Shortly thereafter defendant came out of King's Lounge, called Peggy, and they went around the corner of the building.  They returned in a few minutes and defendant reentered the lounge while Peggy talked to the other girls at the car in the parking lot.  When defendant came out of King's Lounge the second time, Peggy left the car and again followed defendant to the side of the tavern.  What then occurred is described by Milton Hunter, an eyewitness, in the following paragraph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunter had parked his car in a parking space at the corner of King's Lounge&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and thus could see down two sides of the building and was seated on the hood of his car drinking beer and talking with an acquaintance, a soldier named Edward Patterson.  He observed defendant and Peggy Ann Bryant beside the building.  He heard defendant call Peggy a vulgar name and say: &quot;I got something for you, I have got your goddamn birthday present right here.&quot; Peggy said: &quot;What is it?&quot; Defendant replied: &quot;This .38 here.&quot; According to the witness Hunter, the pistol was not in defendant's hand at the time.  &quot;He reached up this way and got up beside of his stomach and got it.&quot; Defendant then shot Peggy Ann Bryant in the face, began hitting the hood of the car next to Hunter's car, and yelled for an ambulance, saying &quot;someone from the highway over there shot my girl friend.&quot; Peggy Ann Bryant was taken by ambulance to the hospital where she died as a result of extensive injury to the brain caused by a bullet which had entered directly above the left eye and penetrated the brain.  An autopsy was performed and two lead fragments lodged in the back of the head were removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous other witnesses testified that they saw Peggy Ann Bryant accompanying the defendant to the side of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  building and then heard a shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Hinton testified that the death weapon was not immediately found but approximately an hour and a half later, after returning from the hospital, he made a thorough search of the parking lot and found a .38 caliber Smith and Wesson revolver with a two-inch barrel approximately four to six parking spaces from where Peggy Ann Bryant was lying.  The pistol was loaded at the time and contained four full rounds and one spent round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gunshot wipings taken from the back of defendant's right hand and the palm of his left hand showed significant concentrations of barium, antimony and lead, particularly on the back of the right hand between the thumb and forefinger.  This indicated that he had recently fired a gun according to the testimony of R. D. Cone, a forensic chemist and an expert in the taking and interpretation of gunshot residue tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glen Glesne, a laboratory analyst in the field of chemisty, blood and body fluids, did an analysis of the blood of Peggy Ann Bryant and determined that it belonged to Group A. Reddish colored stains on the shoes and trousers of defendant were analyzed and found to be blood of human origin which demonstrated the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A blood grouping factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered no evidence.  The jury convicted defendant of murder in the first degree and he was sentenced to death.  His appeal to this Court presents for review the assignments of error discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During defendant's trial for the murder of his girlfriend, the state was permitted to ask each prospective juror their opinion on capital punishment. Following the conviction of defendant, he argued on appeal that the trial court erred in allowing the jurors to be questioned concerning their views on capital punishment and that certain evidence was improperly admitted. The court upheld that judgment, holding that all the evidence tended to show a senseless, vicious, calculated murder without mitigating circumstances. Further, the court held that defendant received a fair trial free from prejudicial error. In support, it was reasoned that the properly admitted evidence of guilt was so overwhelming, and the prejudicial effect of the stricken evidence was so insignificant by comparison. The court also found that there was a relevant connection between the state's exhibit and the murder of the victim. The court concluded that the weapon was properly admitted into evidence and that defendant was not prejudiced by the introduction of the results of the gunshot residue test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court upheld that judgment convicting defendant of murder of his girlfriend and sentencing him to the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

Said magazines and pictures are obscene in that their dominant theme taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest in sex, the material is patently offensive in that it affronts contemporary national community standards relating to the description or representation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of sexual matters, the material is utterly without redeeming social value, and the material as used is not protected or privileged under the Constitution of the U.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the decision of the COURT OF APPEALS OF NORTH CAROLINA, which, upon remand from the U.S. Supreme Court, affirmed his conviction for disseminating obscene literature to the public, a violation of N.C.

The affidavit supporting the warrant provided that defendant operated a book store and that he unlawfully disseminated obscene literature to the public by exhibiting, offering for sale, and selling to a member of the public certain magazines in violation of &sect; 14-190.1. Defendant appealed his conviction to the appellate court, contending that &sect; 14-190.1 was unconstitutional because it failed to incorporate standards that were held to be constitutionally required by the Supreme Court in defining obscenity. In its prior judgment, the appellate court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 14-190.1 and, after remand from the Supreme Court, upheld it again as applied to the charges against defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 14-190.1 as applied to the charges against defendant based on its opinion in State v. Bryant and State v. Floyd.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McConnell, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 18 June 1973 Criminal Session of Union.  This case was docketed and argued as No. 98 at the Fall Term 1973.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was found guilty of the rape of Gwendolyn Blackmon, a 16 year old Negro girl; the first degree murder of David Timothy Parker, a 16 year old white boy; the kidnapping of Gwendolyn Blackmon; and the armed robbery of David Timothy Parker.  He was sentenced to death for the rape and for the murder and to imprisonment for life for the kidnapping.  Prayer for judgment was continued on the charge of armed robbery, the State having relied upon this felony as an essential element of the murder in the first degree.  The defendant appealed from all three of the judgments imposed, setting forth 126 assignments of error, many of which were abandoned in his brief.  Many others present the same question of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the selection of the jury, the defendant made certain pretrial motions, including a motion for change of venue.  From exhibits offered by the defendant in support of this motion, it appears that on 9 February 1973 the defendant was serving a sentence of 23 to 28 years in Odom Prison for two murders by stabbing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with a knife, a circumstance not disclosed by the evidence presented in the presence of the jury in the present cases.  It further appears from these exhibits that he was permitted to leave the prison on that date to attend a state convention of the Junior Chamber of Commerce (Jaycees), he being an officer in the chapter of that organization established in Odom Prison.  While at the convention, he eluded the guard who had accompanied him and escaped.  Two days later, he was in Charlotte and engaged in the activities from which the present charges arise.  Four days thereafter, he was arrested by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Memphis, Tennessee.  Waiving extradition, he was returned to Union County for trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant offered no evidence before the jury.  That introduced by the State showed, in substance, the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, 11 February 1973, Gwendolyn Blackmon, a 16 year old Negro high school student, drove alone in her automobile to the Charlotte Public Library.  As she was getting out of her car in the parking lot, a man, whom she had never seen before but whom she positively identified, in court, as the defendant, pushed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her back into the car, telling her that if she screamed or did not &quot;go along with what he said,&quot; he would kill her, tied her hands behind her back, showed her a &quot;scout knife,&quot; compelled her to lie down on the seat, took her keys from her purse and drove off with her in the car, telling her he was a sex maniac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon arriving at a location, subsequently pointed out by Gwendolyn Blackmon to the sheriff, on a dirt road in rural Union County, the defendant put the girl into the back seat of the car, disrobed her completely and, with the knife at hand, had sexual intercourse with her, following which he committed an unnatural sexual act upon her.  When, prior to these acts, she begged him not to touch her, he replied that he &quot;didn't like for people to beg him, so please stop begging.&quot; Following these acts, he instructed her to get dressed and, when she did so, he retied her hands behind her back.  They returned to the front seat of the car and the defendant drove to the town of Waxhaw.  En route, he told her he wished she were white because, if she were, he would kill her, but &quot;if he could find a way of getting another car,&quot; he would give her car back to her and let her go free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arriving&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at the launderette in Waxhaw, the defendant parked beside another car, a 1971 Pontiac Grand Prix, yellow with a cream vinyl top, in which a 16 year old white boy, David Timothy Parker, sat alone.  The defendant, taking the keys to Gwendolyn Blackmon's car with him, and leaving her in her car with her hands still tied behind her back, walked over to the boy's car.  The Parker boy rolled down his window and the defendant engaged him in a brief conversation.  The defendant then pulled the knife from his pants and stabbed the boy twice.  The boy tried to get out of the other side of his car but was unable to do so.  The blood was gushing from his mouth and nose.  The defendant shoved the dying boy over onto the passenger's side of the front seat, got in the car and drove away.  He returned momentarily to untie Gwendolyn Blackmon's hands and give her back the keys to her car.  Thereupon, she returned to her home in Charlotte and reported what had happened to her parents and to the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 5:00 p.m. that afternoon, David Timothy Parker had borrowed his brother's 1971 Pontiac Grand Prix, yellow with a white vinyl top, saying he was going to the launderette.  On 13 February, his&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  body was discovered in a roadside ditch, 5.4 miles from the Waxhaw launderette.  The cause of his death was a deep stab wound in the left chest.  The Parker automobile was discovered in Charlotte, the night of 11 February.  Its interior was quite bloody.  No one other than David Timothy Parker had the owner's permission to drive it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 9:00 p.m. on 11 February, Charlotte Police Officers Griffin and Callahan, while patrolling in a police automobile, observed the Parker car parked beside a telephone booth and a man, identified, in court, by Officer Griffin as the defendant, standing in the booth.  They turned into the parking lot.  As they drew near the Parker automobile, the defendant drove away in it.  The officers pursued him with their blue light flashing and horn blowing.  They bumped the Parker car several times in unsuccessful efforts to stop it.  Finally, the defendant slowed down, jumped from the car and fled on foot.  He was pursued by Officer Griffin but escaped by climbing over a fence which the officer was unable to climb.  On the ground at that point, Officer Griffin found a coat containing a name plate bearing the defendant's name.  The coat was identified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by Gwendolyn Blackmon as the one worn by her assailant.  A &quot;hunting knife&quot; was found in the glove compartment of the Parker automobile by the police officers.  It was not there when the vehicle was lent by its owner to David Timothy Parker.  It was identified by Gwendolyn Blackmon as the knife used by her assailant in her abduction and in the stabbing of David Timothy Parker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 15 February, F.B.I. Agents Phelps and Cooper located and arrested the defendant in Memphis, Tennessee, a warrant charging unlawful flight having been issued for his arrest.  The defendant was then carrying in his pocket a kitchen knife with a six-inch serrated blade.  Following a voir dire examination, duly conducted, the trial court found that the defendant had been given the full Miranda warning by these officers, had signed a written waiver of his right to counsel prior to interrogation by them, was then not under the influence of intoxicating beverages, was experienced in matters of police interrogation, was well versed in his constitutional rights, was not threatened or promised any reward and signed voluntarily a written statement, which statement was admitted into evidence.  It was to the following&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  effect:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in Raleigh attending a Jaycee meeting, the defendant walked away.  By &quot;hitching&quot; rides and traveling by bus, he arrived in Charlotte.  There he saw a Negro girl getting out of her car near the library, &quot;told her to shove over and not to holler&quot; or he would hurt her, took her in her car out into the country and there &quot;made love&quot; to her after explaining that he did not want to hurt her.  Then he drove on with the girl, in her car, to Waxhaw where they observed a white boy sitting in a car in the parking lot of a launderette.  The defendant parked close to the other vehicle, got out, approached the boy, engaged him in a brief conversation, pulled out his knife, stabbed the boy, shoved him over to the passenger's side where he died in two or three minutes, and drove off with the boy's body in the car.  After driving around fifteen or twenty minutes, he put the body in the ditch and proceeded back to Charlotte where he stopped at a telephone booth and called his mother in Louisiana.  After leaving the telephone booth, he was observed and chased by police officers whom he evaded.  He stole another car in Mocksville and drove to Knoxville, Tennessee, where he took a bus to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Memphis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, in an oral statement, also found by the court to have been made voluntarily, following the full Miranda warning, the defendant told these F.B.I. agents that after leaving Waxhaw with the body of the Parker boy in the car, he became stuck in a ditch due to snow; a motorist, passing by with his wife and several children, stopped and helped him to get out of the ditch; had the motorist observed the body of the Parker boy in the car, the defendant &quot;would have had to kill the man and his family.&quot; He further stated to Agent Cooper that he felt no guilt at the murder of the young boy in Waxhaw, and that if he had the opportunity he would kill Agent Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of 11 February, Gwendolyn Blackmon gave to Sheriff Fowler of Union County a statement concerning the abduction, the rape, the murder and the theft of the Parker car which was essentially the same as her testimony in court, above summarized.  She then accompanied Sheriff Fowler to and pointed out the place where the rape occurred and the launderette where the stabbing of the Parker boy occurred.  At that time, she told the sheriff her assailant was &quot;a black male, with a medium short bush, a mustache&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and &quot;a gold tooth with an emblem of a star in the center of it.&quot; The defendant has such a tooth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheriff Fowler received the defendant from the federal officers in Memphis and returned him to North Carolina.  After a voir dire, duly conducted, the court found as facts that the defendant was given the Miranda warning by the sheriff, signed a waiver of his right to counsel, was not under the influence of any intoxicating beverage or narcotic drug, was intelligent and well educated and that no promises or threats were made to him but that he freely and voluntarily and intelligently made a statement to Sheriff Fowler.  Evidence on the voir dire examination supported these findings.  The statement of the defendant to the sheriff was then admitted in evidence.  It was to the following effect:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant, a colored male born 4 October 1950, completed 12 grades in school.  On 9 February 1973, he &quot;escaped from Odom Prison.&quot; He went to Charlotte and on 11 February he saw &quot;a small black girl&quot; getting out of her car and told her to get back in.  She &quot;hollered&quot; and he told her to shut up or he would hurt her.  She then got back in her car and he tied her hands behind her, told her to lie down&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the car, which she did, and he drove away with her.  After driving about 15 miles into the country, he told the girl he wanted her car and she could get out but she would not leave her car.  He then drove onto a dirt road and parked and told the girl &quot;if she made love&quot; he would not hurt her.  Thereupon, he had sexual relations with her.  Driving on to Waxhaw, he observed a white boy sitting in a Grand Prix Pontiac car in front of a launderette.  He told the girl he had to get another car, so he parked beside the Pontiac, went to the driver's side, told the boy he was having car trouble and asked the boy to help him.  When the boy refused, the defendant pulled a &quot;scout knife&quot; from his belt and stabbed the boy twice, once in the upper chest and once in the shoulder.  The boy was striking at the defendant when the defendant stabbed him.  The wound in the chest killed the boy in two or three minutes.  The defendant then told the girl to leave, which she did.  Her name was Gwendolyn Blackmon.  The defendant then got in the white boy's car and rode around for about 15 minutes before he became stuck in a ditch, from which a passing motorist pulled him.  The defendant &quot;was glad the people&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  who pulled him out of the ditch didn't see the body&quot; as he did not know what he might have done to them if they had done so.  The defendant then put the body of the white boy in a ditch and drove on to Charlotte where he was chased by but eluded the police officers.  Going on to Mocksville he stole another automobile which he drove to Knoxville, Tennessee.  From there he took a bus to Memphis where he was arrested.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the trial court (North Carolina), following a jury trial, convicting him of rape, first degree murder, kidnapping, and armed robbery, and sentencing him to death for the rape and murder and to imprisonment for life for the kidnapping. Prayer for judgment was continued on the charge of armed robbery, the state having relied upon the felony as an essential element of the murder in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that even if he had received a fair trial, it was error to sentence him to death. The court affirmed. The court was required to interpret N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17 concerning the sentence for murder, and &sect; 14-21 concerning the sentence for rape, in light of the United States Supreme Court's holding that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments forbade a state to inflict the penalty of death if, under the law of the state, either the jury or the judge was permitted, as a matter of discretion, to choose between the imposition of the death penalty and the penalty of imprisonment. The court held that the meaning of &sect;&sect; 14-17, 14-21 was that a defendant, lawfully convicted of first degree murder or rape, the offense having been committed after January 18, 1973, was required to be sentenced to death, and that the trial judge had no discretion in the matter and the jury had no authority to fix a different punishment. The court held that the United States Constitution required the punishment prescribed to be reasonably adapted to the attainment of the goals of all criminal punishment. The court held that &sect;&sect; 14-17, 14-21 as construed met this standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Petitioner appeals from judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Martin, S.J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 12 February 1973 Extra Civil Session, Mecklenburg Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the Charlotte City Council adopted a resolution of intent to annex the Albemarle Road-York Road area, fixed the date for a public hearing on the question of annexation, and published notice of said public hearing in The Charlotte Observer, the petitioner, Mrs. Charles DeForest Lucas, through her counsel, appeared before the City Council and requested that her property be deleted from the annexation area.  Her request was denied, and on 9 January 1973 she filed a petition in the superior court requesting review pursuant to G.S. 160-453.18 (now G.S. 160A-50).  Judicial review of the annexation proceedings was conducted by Martin, S.J., at the 12 February 1973 Extra Civil Session, Mecklenburg Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner's timely motion for a jury trial was denied and evidence was thereupon offered by both petitioner and the City of Charlotte.  The court then made findings of fact and conclusions of law as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Findings of Fact</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1. On October 24, 1972 the Charlotte City Council passed a resolution stating its intent to consider the annexation of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  property known as the Albemarle Road-York Road Area, which was fully and accurately described in the resolution.  In accordance with the provisions of the resolution, notice of a public hearing on the question of annexation was published in a local newspaper of general circulation on November 6, 7, 13, 20 and 27 of 1972.  A public hearing was held on December 1, 1972.  The Charlotte City Council enacted the ordinance in question on December 11, 1972 and set its effective date as June 30, 1973.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2. The metes and bounds description of the area to be annexed that was published on November 6, 1972 was not complete in that the description was to be continued to another page of the newspaper but was not in fact continued.  The remaining publications which were published once a week for four successive weeks contained complete and accurate descriptions of the area to be annexed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission had begun considering the possibilities of annexation in 1969.  Twelve areas were initially studied to determine whether each of these areas satisfied the criteria for annexation set forth in Part 3, Article 36, Chapter 160 of the General Statutes.  Four of the areas&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  were determined by the Planning Commission not to be appropriate for annexation under the statutory guidelines.  Of the eight remaining areas, six, when considered collectively, physically formed one large area.  Since each of the six areas had qualified for annexation under the Planning Commission's studies, these areas were then considered, for purposes of annexation, as one area, the Albemarle Road-York Road Area.  No attempt was made to ascertain whether the area as a whole could be properly annexed since a determination had been made earlier that each of the six study areas had qualified individually under Part 3, Article 36, Chapter 160 of the General Statutes.  The resultant area contains approximately 17,899 acres and 37,948 residents or approximately 2.12 persons per acre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">4. In establishing the boundaries of the six study areas and thus determining the boundary of the annexation area in question, the Planning Commission adopted a policy of including as much property as possible within the area to be annexed.  While the boundary of the area to be annexed is irregular, the evidence shows that this irregularity is largely due to actual patterns of residential, commercial, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  institutional development.  A factor which contributed to a minor extent to the irregularity was the respondent's conglomeration of the six study areas into one area for the actual process of annexation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">5. Evidence was presented to the Court concerning large tracts of very valuable property which were not included within the area to be annexed.  These unannexed areas were referred to as &quot;fingers&quot; reaching into the area of annexation and were further identified as being in the vicinity of Monroe Road, Providence Road, Carmel Road and Quail Hollow Road.  (These areas may also be found on petitioner's exhibit number 8: Monroe Road -- 1, 2 and 3; Providence Road -- 4, 5, 6, and 7; Carmel Road -- 8 and 9; Quail Hollow Road -- 10 and 11.) Uncontradicted evidence shows that: The area near Monroe Road contains 431.62 acres; the area in the vicinity of Providence Road contains 454.62 acres; the area near Carmel Road contains 571.5 acres; and the area around Quail Hollow Road contains 356.59 acres.  Evidence presented by the petitioner as to the number of residences in these areas is conflicting and sketchy, but even accepting a liberal view of the evidence and applying the uncontroverted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  figure of 3.42 as the average number of persons per household in the area to be annexed, these large tracts could not have been included in the area to be annexed without disqualifying the entire area on the criteria of population density.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">6. On January 9, 1973, Mrs. Ruth S. Lucas filed a petition in Superior Court seeking review of Charlotte Ordinance 689-X which directs the annexation of the Albemarle Road-York Road Area.  The petitioner is the owner of real property, approximately 106 acres of which is included within the area to be annexed.  The petitioner's property is located on the eastern edge of the annexation area.  Her western border is formed by Campbell Creek, the southern border by Margaret Wallace Road and a portion of her property touches McAlpine Creek which forms much of the actual annexation boundary.  Abutting petitioner's property is the Thompson Orphanage and a sixty-eight acre tract owned by petitioner's daughter and son-in-law.  The orphanage normally cares for 40-50 children at one time.  Independence Boulevard is located less than one thousand feet from the petitioner's property.  As is pointed out on page seven of the Plan, Independence Boulevard is a major&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  arterial road drawing concentrated commercial and residential development.  This fact is further illustrated by the &quot;Generalized Land Use&quot; map contained in the Plan for annexation.  Independence Boulevard, or U.S. 74, generates a great deal of commercial and industrial activity, not only close to the existing City Limit but also in the vicinity of petitioner's property.  In addition to those commercial and industrial uses shown on the land use map, a major car dealership has recently opened on the northern side of Independence Boulevard close to its intersection with Margaret Wallace Road.  A large development of single family residences is located approximately 700 feet west of the northern tip of the petitioner's property and a second development of single family residences is located a short distance north of petitioner's property.  Just to the southwest of petitioner's property and across Independence Boulevard is a large apartment complex.  The evidence established that the complex contained 224 units at the time the qualification study for the area was conducted in 1971 and that plans call for 2,000 units to be constructed eventually.  Directly across from petitioner's property&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  on Margaret Wallace Road are approximately twenty-six single family residences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">7. There is one house on the petitioner's property in which petitioner lives alone.  The petitioner's property is not otherwise developed for commercial or residential purposes due to petitioner's desire not to develop her property.  In addition, petitioner agreed to restrict any development of her property to three acre lots when she conveyed sixty-eight acres of her property to her daughter and son-in-law, whose property was burdened with a similar restriction.  Portions of petitioner's property which border McAlpine and Campbell Creeks are not suited for residential development since these areas are flooded when heavy rains cause the creeks to overflow their banks.  However, the real reason, as petitioner has testified, why she does not wish her property to be included within the area to be annexed is that she cannot afford to pay the taxes on the property without developing it.  She does not want to develop it because of the property's very low basis for purposes of capital gains taxation.  If she can retain the property until she dies, the property will acquire a basis equal to its fair market value&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  at the time of her death so that her devisees will receive a great economic benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">8. The petitioner has not presented any evidence that tends to show that she has in any way suffered any injury because the metes and bounds description published on November 6, 1972 was incomplete.  There is no evidence which tends to show that she was misled or did not know that her property would be included within the area to be annexed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">9. Section 3 of Ordinance No. 689-X reads as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;That it is the purpose and intent of the City of Charlotte to provide services to the area being annexed under the ordinance, as set forth in the report of plans for services approved by the City Council on the 6th day of November, 1972, and filed in the office of the Clerk for public inspection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">The ordinance did not contain nor paraphrase the plan for providing municipal services to the area as set forth in the plan prepared to satisfy Sec. 160-453.15 of the General Statutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Court makes the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Conclusions of Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1. The area as designated by the respondent and known as the Albemarle Road-York Road Area meets all criteria authorizing annexation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  under Part 3, Article 36, Chapter 160 of the General Statutes.  The annexation proceedings instituted by the respondent show </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">prima facie</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> that there has been substantial compliance with the essential provisions of these statutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Certainly a notice publication in some form of the public hearing is an essential element of an annexation proceeding.  However, it is not necessary for this Court to decide if each and every aspect of the notice publication as outlined in Sec. 160-453.17(b) must be exactly followed before an otherwise proper annexation proceeding is to be remanded.  The Court is especially mindful of this consideration where, as here, there has been no allegation or showing of any injury to the petitioner resulting from the alleged failure to publish the notice according to the letter of the statute.  Suffice it to hold under the facts of this petition that the publication of notice on November 6, 1972, even though incomplete in its boundary description, may be properly considered in computing whether the time period between the dates of the first and last publication amounts to twenty-two days.  So considered there are twenty-two days between the dates of first and last&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  publication.  Alternatively, the Court holds, in any event, that the twenty-two day restriction is not an essential element of the annexation statutes so that its violation, absent a showing of material injury, does not command that the ordinance be remanded, at least where every other notice requirement has been followed explicitly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2. The petitioner has admitted in open Court that the respondent has followed the letter of the annexation statutes (except for the publication of notice).  Under the facts of this case, the literal requirements of Part 3, Article 36, Chapter 160 of the General Statutes have been met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3. While this Court does have only limited jurisdiction in reviewing an annexation proceeding, that jurisdiction does include a judicial determination of whether the respondent abused its discretion in improperly establishing the boundary of the area to be annexed so as to include the petitioner's property.  Also within this Court's power is a determination of whether the application of the annexation statutes for cities of over 5,000 residents to the petitioner's property under the facts of this petition is proper under the Constitution of North Carolina and the Fourteenth&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  Amendment to the United States Constitution.  However, these are heavy burdens to bear and the petitioner has not met these burdens.  The evidence properly before this Court does not establish any abuse of discretion.  While the Director of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission testified that the policy followed in defining the area to be annexed was to include as much property as possible regardless of that property's development, an examination of the evidence reveals that the areas actually to be annexed are either developed for urban purposes or are undergoing such development.  At least the petitioner has not satisfied this Court to the contrary, and the petitioner does have the burden of proof on this point.  The fact that a particular piece of property is undeveloped and included within an area to be annexed is not evidence of abuse of discretion by the annexing body where there is competent evidence that property in close proximity is undergoing such development.  The fact that the boundary of the annexation area may be irregular in appearance is not, by itself, evidence of arbitrary and capricious action by the governing body in instituting an annexation proceeding. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  The applicable law requires only that the boundary follow urban patterns of development and, whenever practical, natural topographic features.  Absent a showing of bad faith or deviation from these statutory guidelines in including petitioner's property, the petitioner cannot establish any abuse of discretion.  No evidence of bad faith is before the Court and the petitioner has not satisfied the Court that the respondent deviated from the statutory guidelines, either in their letter or their spirit.  Specifically, it has not been established that respondent used different interpetations of these statutory guidelines in locating a boundary line for one study area than was used in other study areas.  Also it has not been shown that respondent's combining of six adjacent study areas into one large area for purposes of an annexation proceeding is improper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">4. While the petitioner's property is undeveloped, whether because of personal desires of self-imposed, developmental restrictions, the area in which it is located is either developed for urban purposes or is undergoing commercial and residential development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">5. Neither Part 3, Article 36, Chapter 160 of the General Statutes nor its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  application by respondent to include the petitioner's property within the Albemarle Road-York Road Area violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Article I, Sections 8, 19 and 25 of the North Carolina Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">6. Section 3 of Ordinance No. 689-X complies with G.S. 160-453.17(c)(2) [sic, evidently intended to be G.S. 160-453.17(e)(2)].  Even if the statute were to be interpreted to state that the entire Plan, or at least a summation of it, for extending services into the area was to be included in Ordinance 689-X, the omission would not be fatal to the annexation proceeding.  Such a statutory provision could not be an essential element of the applicable annexation statutes.  The respondent has bound itself not only morally but legally to provide the services outlined in the Plan.  This is true regardless of whether the Plan is rerecited in the ordinance.  Section 3 clearly identifies the Plan as being definitive on the question of how the area is to be treated upon the effective date of annexation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">7. The respondent properly exercised its discretion in following the flow of McAlpine Creek so as to include petitioner's property within an area to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  be annexed into the City of Charlotte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Upon the foregoing findings of fact, it is Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that the action of the City Council of the City of Charlotte in the adoption of Annexation Ordinance is affirmed and the annexation may take place as scheduled.  The costs of this action shall be taxed against the petitioner.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals, and we allowed motion to bypass that court prior to determination of the controversy.  The case is now before the Supreme Court for initial appellate review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By virtue of a consent order this appeal concerns petitioner's property only, permitting the annexation to be effective with respect to the remainder of the areas annexed concerning which no appeal has been taken.  G.S. 160-453.18(h).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner landowner had requested that her property be deleted from an annexation area. The landowner appealed a judgment of the Mecklenburg County Superior Court (North Carolina), which, after a bench trial, upheld an annexation ordinance adopted by respondent, the City Council of the City of Charlotte, North Carolina. The annexation area included the landowner's property, on which she was the only resident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner contended that, due to the involvement of constitutional questions, she was entitled to a jury trial. The court held that the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. 160-453.18(f), now N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-50(f), which authorized review of annexation proceedings by the trial court without a jury, were constitutional and had not been superceded by the N.C. R. Civ. P. 38(a). The landowner contended that the City acted arbitrarily because it did not uniformly apply the same population standards through the entire annexation area. The landowner insisted that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-453.16(c)(1), now N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-48(c)(1), required exclusion of her property from the annexation area. Section 160-453.16(c)(1) related to resident population requirements for a whole annexation area. Contrary to the legislative intent and standard in &sect; 160-453.16(c)(1), the City had divided up the annexation area into study areas and applied the statutory population requirements to each study area. The court held that the City acted arbitrarily by not applying the population requirements uniformly to the annexation area as a whole and that the landowner's property should have been excluded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">With respect to the landowner's property, the court reversed the judgment that had upheld the annexation ordinance. The court excluded the landowner's property from the annexation area. The court affirmed the judgment with respect to the remainder of the annexation area.</SPAN></P>

<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried in Wilson County District Court on 12 December 1972 and found guilty.  Judgment was entered sentencing him to imprisonment for a term of 30 days in the Wilson County Jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appealed to the Superior Court of Wilson County.  Upon the call of the case in Wilson County Superior Court, and prior to commencement of the trial, defendant moved to quash the warrant on the grounds that (1) it failed to allege a crime and (2) the City Ordinance was unconstitutional.  The Motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence as reflected in the record of defendant's trial in Wilson Superior Court tends to show the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 15 September 1972, defendant applied to the Wilson City Manager for a permit for a parade to be held on 17 September 1972.  This permit was granted, and the parade was held on that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant again applied to the City Manager on 12 October 1972 for a permit for a parade to be held on 15 October 1972.  That application was denied.  This decision was appealed to the City Council on 13 October 1972.  On the same day, the City Council conducted a hearing and after finding as a fact that the proposed parade constituted a threat to the public safety and to the safety of the participants in the march, upheld the decision of the City Manager.  However, the City Council proposed, as an alternative to the denied application, a parade over a different route, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and offered to waive the provision in the City Ordinance requiring that application for a parade permit be made seventy-two hours prior to the date of the proposed parade.  No application for a permit over the alternative route was made and no parade was conducted over either route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 30 November 1972, in response to a call, Robert Johnston, a police officer for the City of Wilson, went to the Atlantic Coastline Railroad Station located within the City of Wilson.  There he observed defendant and approximately one hundred other people on and within the curbs of East Nash Street.  Defendant was observed in the middle of the front row of the group of people with his arms linked to others in that row.  Officer Johnston saw the group travel approximately fifty to seventy-five feet down the street.  At that time, he advised defendant that he was under arrest.  He also advised the other members of the group that they were violating the law, but if they would not participate further in the parade, they would not be arrested.  However, approximately one hundred members of the group refused to dissipate and were also arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. J. T. Smith, a detective with the City of Wilson Police Department, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was also present at the time of the arrests.  He observed a group of approximately one hundred people crossing the railroad tracks on Nash Street.  The people were arrayed from curb to curb and completely blocked the street.  He observed defendant in approximately the middle of the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of defendant's arrest, Bruce T. Boyette was the City Manager for the City of Wilson.  He testified that neither defendant nor any other person made an application for a parade permit for that area of the city for that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant moved to dismiss at the close of the State's evidence.  The motion was denied.  Defendant offered no evidence and renewed his Motion to Dismiss which was again denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was found guilty of the charge of parading without a permit, and judgment was entered sentencing him to imprisonment for a term of thirty days in the Wilson County Jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant appealed to the North Carolina Court of Appeals.  The Court of Appeals found no error in the trial below.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">State v.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction and argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court affirmed and held that the ordinance was directed to the time, place, and manner of parades and did not impose any restraint upon speech covering political matters or matters of public concern. The court further determined that the statute did not contain any inkling of discrimination against defendant or his associates. The court concluded that the only provision in the ordinance that was possibly restrictive was the preclusion of the distribution of materials while riding in a parade. The court found that this indirect effect on speech was justified because it promoted the safety, comfort, and convenience of the general public. The court ruled that the ordinance made ample provision for review of the denial of a permit by the city council. The court held that the local government's control of its streets pursuant to the provisions of the ordinance was not exercised in a way that denied or unreasonably abridged defendant's First Amendment freedoms.</SPAN></P>

Each holds for his place of business &quot;an off premises beer permit&quot; issued under Part 2 of Article 4, Chapter 18A, General Statutes.  Each holds the applicable ABC Privilege License issued pursuant to the ordinances of the Town of Gibsonville.  Each operates his place of business on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint further alleges:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;11. That in the Town of Gibsonville are several business establishments holding 'brown bagging' license and operating on Sunday and are selling beer and wine without interference from the City Officials or the Chief of Police.  That the Plaintiffs do not have 'brown bagging' permits and are operating their businesses across the street or in the same block in some instances where businesses are being operated on Sunday and the sale of beer and wine is conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;12. That the Plaintiffs operate their business in the Town of Gibsonville, selling beer and wine as their licenses permit at their place of business on other days of the week and desire to do so on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;13. That the threatened&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  enforcement by the Town of Gibsonville of the prohibition of Sunday beer and wine sales will cause irreparable damage to all of the Plaintiffs herein in that they will suffer multiple arrests and harassments; and that they will be prevented from a lawful activity without authorization, with the result of loss of profits from said Sunday beer and wine sales; that they will suffer from undue publicity and loss of good will; that they will have no adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;14. That the enforcement of Chapter L, Article IV of the ordinances of the Town of Gibsonville as to the Plaintiffs in the operation of their businesses is invalid, void and in violation of Article I, Section 19 of the North Carolina Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States in that it is unreasonable and discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;15. That Section 33(b) of Chapter 18A of the North Carolina General Statutes violates Article I, Section 19 of the North Carolina Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States in that it is unreasonable and discriminatory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the basis of the allegations of the complaint the plaintiffs pray for the following relief: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  <BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;1. For a declaratory judgment that Chapter L, Article IV of the ordinances of the Town of Gibsonville is invalid and of no force and effect as to these Plaintiffs and others similarly situated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;2. That the Defendants be permanently enjoined from preventing Plaintiffs from selling beer on Sunday at the times specified herein or at such times as the Court declares it to be lawful for them to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;3. That the Court, pending a final determination of this matter, issue a preliminary injunction restraining and enjoining the Defendants in the above described manner and form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;4. That the Court, pending the issuance of such preliminary injunction, accept this verified complaint as a motion for temporary restraining order under Rule 65 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, and that the Court issue a Temporary Restraining Order restraining and enjoining the Defendants either individually or through any persons acting under or in connection with them in the above described manner and form.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Attorney General of North Carolina intervened as a party defendant and filed answer admitting the essential factual allegations of the complaint.  The Attorney General alleged, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  however, that only one establishment in Gibsonville (Pete's Grill) holds a &quot;brown bagging&quot; permit.  The Attorney General filed with the court a motion that the plaintiffs' applications for a temporary restraining order and for a permanent injunction be denied and the plaintiffs' action be dismissed for that the complaint fails to set forth a claim upon which relief may be granted.  The Attorney General moved also that the court declare the ordinances of the Town of Gibsonville constitutional and valid except that the Town is without authority to invalidate a duly authorized &quot;brown bagging&quot; permit issued pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 18A-33(b) of the General Statutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Exum, after hearing, entered the following judgment:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;1. The Town of Gibsonville shall hereafter give no further force or effect to the proviso of G.S. 18A-33(b) insofar as it purports to prohibit Gibsonville from enforcing its Ordinance against businesses holding Brown Bagging Permits to the extent that these businesses sell beer on Sundays for consumption off-premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;2. The Town of Gibsonville shall hereafter enforce the Ordinance against all businesses whether or not the businesses hold a Brown Bagging&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  Permit to the extent that these businesses sell beer on Sundays for consumption off their own premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;3. The Town of Gibsonville shall comply fully with the proviso of G.S. 18A-33(b) insofar as it prohibits Gibsonville from enforcing the Ordinance against the sale of beer for consumption on-premises by any business which has a Brown Bagging Permit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the plaintiffs and the Attorney General appealed to the North Carolina Court of Appeals.  After review, the Court of Appeals concluded:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;The ordinance of the town of Gibsonville as authorized by G.S. 18A-33(b) is valid and enforceable against all its citizens without discrimination.  G.S. 18A-33(b) is a constitutional exercise of the power of the General Assembly except for the proviso which excludes businesses with Article 3 or 'brown bagging' permits from the remainder of G.S. 18A-33(b).  The proviso is unconstitutional and void.  The judgment below is modified to permit the town of Gibsonville to enforce its ordinance against the sale of beer and wine on Sundays after 1:00 p.m. without restriction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, town, the chief of police, and the state attorney general sought review of the decision of the North Carolina Court of Appeals, which concluded that the town's ordinance that included a proviso regarding &quot;brown bagging&quot; alcohol permits was unconstitutional and void. The trial court's judgment was modified to permit the town to enforce its ordinance against the sale of beer and wine on Sundays after 1:00 p.m. without restriction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff grocery store owners sought a declaratory judgment and injunction preventing the enforcement of the town's ordinances regarding the sale of alcohol on Sundays. The court noted that the parties and the lower courts had proceeded on the theory that the grocery store owners had a constitutional right to engage in the sale and distribution of wine and beer. Other than as authorized by a legally issued permit, the court concluded that there was no right to sell beer, wine, and other alcoholic beverages in the State of North Carolina. A liquor license permit granted a privilege. It did not convey either a constitutional right or a property right. It was subject to cancellation by the issuing authority for cause. The sale of alcoholic beverages was only legal when authorized by a legally issued permit. The court held that the record in the case disclosed neither a legal nor a factual foundation upon which a court of equity could grant to the grocery store owners the relief they demanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment that determined that the proviso in the ordinance was unconstitutional and void and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proceeding was instituted before the Burial Commissioner of North Carolina pursuant to G.S. 58-241.4 seeking a decision requiring Orrell Mutual Burial Association (Orrell) to pay in cash, benefits due its deceased member Maggie Bange.  Orrell appealed from the Burial Commissioner's decision directing it to pay the $ 200 benefit in cash to the represesntative of Maggie Bange.  The matter came on for trial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Randolph County Superior Court where the parties waived a jury trial and the case was heard on stipulated facts.  These facts disclosed the following: Maggie Bange joined Orrell Burial Association on 7 September 1959 and remained a member in good standing until her death on 2 November 1971.  Upon her death, she was entitled to maximum funeral benefits of $ 200.  At the request of the persons contracting for her burial, Cumby Mortuary, Inc. (Cumby) furnished all services incident to Mrs. Bange's burial.  Mrs. Bange's representatives requested Orrell, both before and after the funeral, to pay to Cumby the full benefits due under Maggie Bange's certificate of membership in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  its Association.  Orrell has refused to pay Cumby or Mrs. Bange's represenatives any amount.  Cumby Mutual Burial Association, Inc. is a duly organized Burial Association and is in good standing under the rules and regulations of the North Carolina Burial Association laws.  Cumby Mortuary, Inc. was the official funeral director of Cumby Burial Association, Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was stipulated that if the Court should rule cash benefits to be due and payable under the certificate issued to Maggie Bange, the payments should be made to Cumby Mutual Burial Association, Inc., Mrs. Robert Adair and Mr. Charles Walter Cadwell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge, after finding facts consistent with those above recited, adjudged and decreed that Orrell pay to Cumby Mortuary, Inc., Mrs. Robert Adair and Mr. Charles Walter Cadwell the sum of $ 200 in cash, together with the costs of the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Orrell appealed, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed.  Defendant appealed from the decision of the Court of Appeals pursuant to G.S. 7A-30(1).  </SPAN></P>

The lower court ordered defendant to pay benefits in cash, and defendant appealed, contending that order approved a statutory change that resulted in impairment of obligations of contract with deceased member, which violated U.S. Const. art.

The court affirmed, holding that provisions of statute and the certificate issued to deceased member both contained an express reservation of power by General Assembly to modify rules and bylaws of Association, that this was ample notice to both defendant and certificate holder, and that the amending statutes and rules implementing them were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried on an indictment charging him with the felonious possession of a firearm in violation of G.S. 14-415.1.  From a verdict of guilty and a judgment imposing a sentence of imprisonment for not less than nine years nor more than ten years, defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals.  That court in an opinion by Judge Campbell, concurred in by Judge Hedrick, ordered the judgment arrested.  Judge Baley dissented and the State appealed, pursuant to G.S. 7A-30(2).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that on 15 September 1972 a confidential informant told Officer W. L. Davis of the Fayetteville Police Department that he had seen a large quantity of heroin, which he valued at approximately $ 30,000, at defendant's home in Fayetteville, North Carolina.  The informant had also observed defendant selling heroin to several persons.  Based on this information, and because the informant had in the past provided information resulting in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the arrest and conviction of drug dealers and users in the Fayetteville area, Officer Davis obtained a search warrant for defendant's home.  On the same day Officer Davis, accompanied by four other officers, entered defendant's house and read the warrant in the presence of defendant and the other occupants.  The search revealed the following items: a marijuana cigarette, 206 syringes, 5 pistols, a rifle, a shotgun, and $ 500 in cash.  Defendant admitted that he was the owner of one of the pistols, but claimed the other firearms belonged to various friends who had left them at his house.  The arresting officer knew that defendant had previously been convicted of the felony of selling marijuana, and consequently charged him with the felonious possession of a firearm in violation of G.S. 14-415.1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant did not testify or offer any evidence.  His counsel, at various stages of the trial, made the following motions: To quash the bill of indictment because G.S. 14-415.1 is unconstitutional and because of the form and insufficiency of the bill; to grant defendant judgment as in the case of nonsuit; and to arrest the judgment.  All motions were denied by the trial court.  </SPAN></P>

The court assumed that at the time of defendant's trial, his citizenship had not been restored pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 13 (amended 1973) then in effect. While defendant's appeal was pending, chapter 13 was replaced by new provisions as provided by 1973 N.C. Sess. Laws 251, codified in part as N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-1, 13-2, which provided for automatic restoration of citizenship upon the unconditional discharge of a probationer. The determinative question presented to the court was whether defendant was entitled to the benefit of the 1973 revision enacted after his trial but while his appeal was pending. The court held that defendant was entitled to have his case disposed of under the law in force at the time of the appellate court's decision. As such, defendant's citizenship had been automatically restored, and he was thereby exempt from the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-415.1.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant is charged in a bill of indictment, proper in form, with burglary in the first degree of the dwelling house of James Harley Davis located at 3422 Kentucky Avenue in Charlotte.  He was first tried for this offense at the 1 May 1972 Schedule &quot;C&quot; Regular Criminal Session of Mecklenburg Superior Court, convicted by the jury, and sentenced to life imprisonment.  On appeal we awarded a new trial due to erroneous admission of hearsay evidence.  See 282 N.C. 189, 192 S.E. 2d 320 (1972).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence offered by the State tends to show the facts narrated below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 5 September 1971 James Harley Davis, his wife Rosa Mae Davis, their twelve-year-old daughter and ten-year-old son were at home in their dwelling at 3422 Kentucky Avenue.  The house had five rooms consisting of three bedrooms, a living room and a kitchen.  On Saturday night, 4 September 1972, Mr. Davis and his son went to bed about 9:00 or 9:30 p.m. in the daughter's bedroom.  Mrs. Davis and the daughter slept in the front bedroom and went to sleep about 12 midnight.  The bathroom was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  between and accessible from the front bedroom in which Mrs. Davis was sleeping and the back bedroom in which Mr. Davis was sleeping.  The third bedroom in which the son normally slept was unoccupied that night due to a fresh paint job.  The windows in the son's bedroom were left open so the odor of the paint might escape.  The screens were in place and were latched by hooks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Davis awoke at approximately 1:50 a.m. A man was leaning over her beside the bed with his hands on her arms and leg.  He was wearing a dark jacket with two white stripes down the sleeves and had a mask or stocking over his head.  She called her husband several times, and each time the man would say, &quot;sh-sh-sh.&quot; When the man stood up and turned her loose, she sat up in bed and screamed.  He struck her in the face and ran toward the living room.  He stopped, turned around, heard Mr. Davis coming through the bathroom, and ran out toward the kitchen.  Mr. Davis, awakened by his wife's screams, searched for the intruder without success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police were called.  Investigation revealed that the screen in the son's bedroom, which was in place and fastened when the family retired for the night, had been removed. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Davis's pants and shirt were found in the son's bedroom, his empty wallet on the bed and his money gone.  A television set and record player located in the corner of the living room were missing.  Plastic flowerpots on stands approximately two and one-half feet tall, one on each side of the television, had been moved from their regular location toward the center of the living room.  Mrs. Davis had owned these two flowerpots about three years and had planted flowers in them many times.  &quot;I would change them and plant more flowers.  I would wash the pots, loosen the dirt and put fresh dirt in.  I kept the pots in the living room and they always stayed indoors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was evidence that neither Mrs. Davis nor her husband had known on seen defendant prior to 5 September 1971; that defendant had never been inside the Davis home; and that defendant had no permission &quot;to come into or carry my television set or stereo or anything out of my home.&quot; None of the missing property has ever been recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers Cobb and Adams of the Charlotte Police Department arrived at the Davis residence at approximately 2:45 a.m. on the morning of 5 September 1971.  Cobb was trained and experienced&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in dusting for fingerprints and had with him the necessary equipment for lifting latent prints.  After speaking with the patrol officers who were already there handling the preliminary investigation, Cobb and Adams entered the house and Cobb dusted for fingerprints around an open window in the son's bedroom but was unable to take any prints from that area.  In the living room Cobb dusted two plastic flowerpots and lifted three latent fingerprints from one of them.  The lifts were made by placing a clear plastic Scotch tape over the prints which showed up in the dust.  The three prints thus lifted from the flowerpot were put on a three by five white index card.  Officer Cobb handed this card to Officer Adams who made certain identifying notations thereon, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">viz</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: the complainant's name and address, the complaint number of this case, the offense, date, and his signature as technician.  Adams put the card in a five by seven envelope and placed it in the &quot;Crime Lab&quot; at the Charlotte Police Department for the attention of Officer Stubbs.  Later, Officer Adams got the card back from Officer Stubbs and used a fingerprint camera to photograph one latent print on the card designated by Officer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stubbs for enlargement purposes.  The photograph thus taken was enlarged and given to Officer Stubbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Stubbs is a fingerprint expert.  Upon receiving from Officer Adams the latent lift from the flowerpot in the Davis home, he searched the master fingerprint file maintained in his office to see if the latent print could be identified from any print in the master file.  Based on leads thus obtained, defendant Willie Foster, Jr., was arrested and fingerprinted on 22 October 1971 in the booking office of the county jail by Preston Pendergrass, Jr., one of the Breathalyzer officers.  In order to eliminate the necessity for Pendergrass to appear as a witness in this case, Officer Stubbs personally fingerprinted defendant on 12 November 1971, and a card bearing these fingerprints is State's Exhibit 2.  An enlargement of defendant's right index fingerprint, as same appears on State's Exhibit 2, is reproduced on the left hand side of State's Exhibit 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right hand side of State's Exhibit 1 purports to be an eight by ten enlargement of the photograph Officer Adams made of the latent print lifted from the flowerpot and given to Officer Stubbs.  This &quot;blowup&quot; is the focal point of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  controversy in this case.  The three by five card on which Officer Adams placed the latent print lifted from the flowerpot has been misplaced or lost from the clerk's office and was not available at this, the second, trial for visual comparison with the &quot;blowup.&quot; The folder to which the &quot;blowup&quot; is attached has on it the words &quot;latent print.&quot; No identifying data on the lost three by five card appears </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">in</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this photograph of the one identifiable print placed on the card.  However, written </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">on</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the bottom right corner of the photograph is the number 71-77794.  Officer Stubbs testified that &quot;when I received the enlargements of the latent, in the lower right-hand corner I put in ink the complaint number that this print was involved with.&quot; Other testimony disclosed that the five by seven manila envelope, from which Officer Stubbs took the latent print card, had written on it &quot;the name of the complainant, the address and complaint number which has been assigned to this particular case.&quot; Examination of the five by seven manila envelope, State's Exhibit 3, discloses the following words and numbers written across the top:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On voir dire in the absence of the jury, Officer Stubbs testified that the blowup photograph on the right hand side of State's Exhibit 1 under the lettering &quot;latent print&quot; fairly and accurately represents &quot;a blowup photograph of the one identifiable print&quot; he had observed on a three by five index card contained in an envelope in the &quot;Crime Lab&quot; marked for his attention: that it is &quot;a blowup photograph of the identifiable print on the three by five card which on the front contained the notation, 'James Harley Davis' and '3422 Kentucky Avenue' and 'September 5, 1971.'&quot; Based thereon, the court overruled defendant's objection, recalled the jury, and admitted in evidence State's Exhibit 1, State's Exhibit 2, and State's Exhibit 3.  Then, over defendant's objection, Officer Stubbs testified that on the left of State's Exhibit 1 &quot;is an enlargement of a known or inked fingerprint.  On the right is an enlargement of what we call the latent or crime scene print.  The comparisons between&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  these two prints are made by what we call points of identification or characteristics.&quot; Officer Stubbs then pointed out thirteen characteristics which are identical in nature and in the same general places on the inked print and on the latent print.  Based on his examination of the two prints, Officer Stubbs testified that in his opinion both were made by the same finger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination Officer Stubbs said he did not know of his own personal knowledge &quot;where the latent lift on a three by five card to which I have testified came from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for defendant is narrated below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hazeline Foster, wife of defendant, testified that on the evening of Saturday, 4 September 1971, and throughout that night, defendant was home in bed; that the family did not own a television set before that date and her husband did not bring home a television on or about that date; that she did the washing for the family and her husband did not own a dark jacket with white stripes down the sleeves and did not own a ski mask.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willie Foster, Jr., testifying in his own behalf, said he was thirty-four years of age and lived at 532 Center Street, Apartment 3, with his wife and son; that he had lived&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Charlotte about twenty-five years; that he has always had more work than he could do including caddying for several years at the country club and working for a number of named individuals, particularly the Triple-A Heating Company; that he lives about a block and a half from Kentucky Avenue but has never been in the Davis home; that he has never owned any type of ski mask or any type of dark jacket with white stripes down the side; that he did not have a television set in his home on 5 September 1971; and that he has been in jail for fourteen months on the present charge.  He emphatically denied that he had ever been on the Davis premises or touched any flowerpots.  He admitted he had been fingerprinted but denied the commission of any criminal acts in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Henry Wilson testified that defendant had done yard work and heavy indoor work in and around her home for two or three years prior to October 1971; that she had left him alone in her house on many occasions and knows other people who regard defendant as an honest and conscientious worker; that his general reputation in the community is excellent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By way of rebuttal, the State examined Lawrence A. Kelly, Identification&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Technician in the sheriff's office.  Mr. Kelly testified that he has worked in the identification of fingerprints for fifty years; that he was with the 27th C.I.D. Crime Lab in Europe for four years and nine months dealing with the identification of fingerprints of displaced persons; that he was with the Durham Police Department, the City-County Bureau of Identification in Fayetteville, and the Mecklenburg County Police Department for twenty years; that he has attended many seminars given by the F.B.I. during the past forty years dealing with the identification of fingerprints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over objection, Mr. Kelly testified that defendant's counsel hired and paid him to examine the two blowup photographs on State's Exhibit 1 and make a comparison between them; that he did so in November 1971; that in his opinion the print on the left and the print on the right were made by one and the same person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of all the evidence defendant renewed his motions previously made to exclude State's Exhibit 1 and to strike all testimony relative thereto, and again moved for judgment of nonsuit.  These motions were denied.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty of burglary in the first degree as charged&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the bill of indictment and defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment.  He appealed to the Supreme Court assigning errors discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Mecklenburg Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted defendant of burglary in the first-degree of dwelling house.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motions to quash the bill of indictment and in arrest of judgment because the judgment pronounced was within the maximum authorized by law and did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The court also held that the trial court did not err in admitting a photography of fingerprints, shown by extrinsic evidence to accurately represent the print it purported to show, as substantive evidence. The court determined that because the evidence as to the common origin of defendant's known fingerprint and the latent print lifted from a flowerpot was so overwhelming and the prejudicial effect of the incompetent testimony concerning the master file fingerprint was so insignificant by caparison, admission of incompetent evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the state was properly allowed to ask defendant on cross-examination for impeachment purposes whether he had committed other named criminal offenses unrelated to the present case and for which he has not been tried or convicted because defendant surrendered his privilege against self-incrimination by testifying on his own behalf.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 10 January 1972 Civil Session of Wake Superior Court, after setting forth the &quot;Agreed Statement of Facts&quot; and his conclusions of law, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Judge Braswell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> entered the following judgment:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, Therefore, it is Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed, that the tuition regulations which provide that the residence status of any student is forever to be determined as of the time of his first enrollment in an institution of higher education in North Carolina, and that residence status may not thereafter be changed if he continues reenrollment without first having dropped out of school for at least a six-months' period, is declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cases of Kenneth Glusman, petitioner, and Anthony B. Lamb, petitioner, are each, hereby remanded to the Residence Status Committee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; which Committee shall conduct a hearing, after notice, and it shall make a determination of residence of each petitioner during the period involved in each petition; and it shall make such ruling and order as the true facts warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In its determination of residence status of each petitioner the respondent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shall not apply its regulations so as to discriminate against a male student who, being married, has since his first enrollment established a bona fide residence in North Carolina, and whose wife would be qualified to be enrolled as an in-state resident by virtue of the husband being then a legal resident of the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Court costs are taxed against the respondent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent, The Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina, excepted and appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Agreed Statement of Facts&quot; disclosed the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Glusman and Lamb had the status of nonresidents of North Carolina for tuition purposes at the time of their original enrollment as students in the Law School of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Law School).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glusman came to North Carolina in September of 1968.  He attended the Law School from September 1968 until June 1969; from September 1969 until June 1970; and from September 1970 until June 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamb came to North Carolina in September of 1969.  He attended the Law School from September 1969 until June 1970; from September 1970 until June 1971; and from September 1971 until December 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each was required to pay the higher&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rates of tuition charged nonresident students as provided by regulations adopted by the Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina on 10 November 1967.  [Subsequently enacted statutes, and subsequently adopted regulations, are not relevant.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glusman seeks a judgment for the asserted difference ($ 1407.50) between the in-State and out-of-State tuition fees of the Law School for the academic years 1969-1970 and 1970-1971.  He asserts no claim for the academic year 1968-1969.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamb seeks an order classifying him as eligible for in-State tuition status in the Law School as of January 1970, less than six months from his coming into North Carolina.  He contends he became a resident for tuition purposes in January 1970 on account of his marriage to Susan I. Lamb, who was domiciled in and a resident of Carrboro, Orange County, North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One regulation provided in substance that a student classified as a nonresident for tuition purposes at the time of his original enrollment, in order to qualify for in-State tuition, must be domiciled in this State for at least six months preceding the date of reenrollment </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">without being enrolled in an institution of higher education during</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> the six-month period</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  The italicized portion of this regulation is attacked by both Glusman and Lamb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamb further contended that the respondent's failure to classify him as a resident for in-State tuition purposes as of the date of his marriage to a North Carolina domiciliary constituted a deprivation of his constitutional rights; that Regulation No. 4 granted in-State tuition status to a nonresident woman upon her marriage to a North Carolina domiciliary; that his marriage to a North Carolina domiciliary conferred upon him the same tuition status Regulation No. 4 conferred upon the nonresident wife of a North Carolina domiciliary; and that the denial thereof amounted to invidious discrimination based on sex in violation of the equal protection clauses of the North Carolina and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Court held that the regulations as interpreted by it were valid, were not subject to successful attack by petitioners, and reversed Judge Braswell's judgment.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Glusman v. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Trustees</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Lamb v. Board of Trustees</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 281 N.C. 629, 190 S.E. 2d 213 (1972). Petitioners appealed.  Reference is made to our prior decision for a complete statement of facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon consideration&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of petitioners' appeal, the Supreme Court of the United States entered the following order: &quot;Judgment vacated and case remanded to the SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA for further consideration in light of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Vlandis v.

The United States Supreme Court vacated the court's judgment, and the court reconsidered its decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The students entered the university's law school as nonresidents and sought to be reclassified as being eligible for in-state tuition status and for reimbursement of the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition fees for at lease two of the three years of their attendance. Their requests were denied because a tuition regulation provided that a nonresident student could not qualify for in-state tuition unless he had been domiciled in the State of North Carolina for six months preceding the date of enrollment. Both students had established their residence in the State for purposes of voting and the payment of taxes. The trial court found that the regulation was unconstitutional as applied, and the court reversed. The Supreme Court vacated the court's judgment. Upon reconsideration, the court vacated the lower court's judgment, holding that a student classified as a nonresident for tuition purposes was entitled to in-state tuition status upon establishing his domicile in the State for six months or more, notwithstanding that during the six-month period he was enrolled in an institution of higher education in the State.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon bills of indictment, proper in form, charging him with (1) first degree burglary of the home of Melvin Lewis Finch, Jr., located at 2110 St. Mary's Street, Raleigh, North Carolina, on 19 April 1972, and (2) larceny from the Finch driveway of one 1968 model Ford automobile valued at $ 1200.00, the property of The News and Observer Publishing Company, Inc.  By consent the two cases were consolidated for trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence offered by the State tends to show the facts narrated below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M. L. Finch, Jr., his wife and three children, reside in a home at 2110 St. Mary's Street.  He is employed by The News and Observer Publishing Company and on 19 April 1972 had in his possession a 1968 Ford automobile which belonged to his employer and was furnished for his use in the performance of his duties.  On the night of 19 April 1972 he parked the vehicle in his driveway behind his house, removed the keys and left them on top of his briefcase on the dining room table when he retired that night about 11:15 p.m. His wife and three children had already gone to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Finch home has two stories and the entire family sleeps upstairs.  The doors and windows were closed when Mr. Finch retired.  Mrs. Finch had been washing windows that day, leaving the ladder used to reach the upper windows leaning against the house.  The windows do not have screens on them.  Mr. Finch arose the next morning about 6:15 or 6:30 a.m., came downstairs and noticed a screen door standing ajar, a window open, his briefcase on the floor of the den, and the car keys gone.  He looked toward the driveway and discovered the car was gone.  The family later discovered that a trumpet, a clarinet, a tape deck and some tapes were missing.  These items, except the tapes, were later recovered, identified by Mr. Finch and offered in evidence.  The automobile was also recovered together with the keys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No member of the Finch family knew the defendant or gave him permission to take the car or any of the other enumerated items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J. Z. Holder is a fingerprint expert employed by the City and County Identification Bureau in Raleigh.  He was called to the Finch residence about 7:30 a.m. on 20 April 1972.  There he dusted the window ledge inside and out, photographed the latent prints&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  made visible by the fingerprint powder, and lifted several latent fingerprints with lifting tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 25 July 1972 Mr. Holder took an inked set of defendant's fingerprints.  He then compared the latent prints lifted from the window ledge at the Finch home with defendant's set of inked prints and determined that the prints of defendant's left index finger, left middle finger and left ring finger were the same as the latent prints found on the window ledge inside the Finch residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">H. Z. Looper is a City detective in Rocky Mount.  Defendant was taken into custody on 18 May 1972 in Rocky Mount, fully advised of his constitutional rights, and signed a waiver of rights reading as follows: &quot;I have read this statement of my rights and I understand what my rights are.  I am willing to make a statement and answer questions.  I do not want a lawyer at this time.  I understand and know what I am doing.  No promises or threats have been made to me and no pressure or coercion of any kind has been used against me by anyone.&quot; The officers thereupon questioned him concerning charges of breaking and entering, carrying a concealed weapon, larceny and first degree burglary allegedly committed by defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Rocky Mount.  Defendant talked freely and made a full confession of numerous offenses committed by him.  He accompanied the officers to a house at 418 Lexington Street in Rocky Mount where, with defendant's permission, the officers searched the house.  They found over two hundred items altogether, including the trumpet, clarinet and other items taken from the Finch home in Raleigh.  The name of Mary Wheeler Finch, 2110 St. Mary's Street, Telephone Number 782-0683 appeared on the trumpet case.  Defendant himself identified these articles.  Officer Holder later surrendered the items of property belonging to Mr. Finch to Detective W. E. Ausley of the Raleigh Police Department.  They were properly identified and offered in evidence at the trial together with a tennis racket and an umbrella belonging to Mr. Finch which were located in the Ford automobile taken by defendant from the Finch driveway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 19 May 1972 Detective Ausley warned defendant of his constitutional rights after which defendant signed a waiver and talked freely concerning the break-in at the Finch home.  Defendant said that around the 20th of April he parked a Rambler that he had stolen in Rocky Mount on St. Mary's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Street in Raleigh; that he walked around behind the house across the street from where he parked, saw a ladder up to one of the windows, climbed the ladder, used a knife to unlock the window, went into the house, got the keys to the car, a clarinet, a trumpet and a small tape deck.  After leaving the house he took a green Ford from behind the house.  He told Detective Ausley that he entered the Finch home some time between midnight and 4 a.m. and said he always worked between midnight and 4 a.m. &quot;because this is the time that people sleep the soundest.&quot; Detective Ausley stated that although he did not know the specific time dawn occurred on the morning of 20 April 1972, &quot;it would have been after 4 a.m. on that date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered no evidence.  His motion for judgment of nonsuit was denied.  The jury found defendant guilty as charged in both cases.  He was sentenced to life imprisonment in the burglary case and ten years in the larceny case to commence at the expiration of the life sentence.  He appealed to the Supreme Court in the burglary case, and we allowed motion to bypass the Court of Appeals in the larceny case.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the orders of the Wake Superior Court, Special Criminal Session (North Carolina) that convicted him of first degree burglary and larceny and that sentenced him to two consecutive life imprisonment terms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant admitted that he broke into the victims' home and stole various items. Defendant consented to the search of his house, where the stolen items were hidden. The court upheld defendant's convictions and sentences. There was no error in the denial of defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial because the length of delay was not unreasonable and the delay did not prejudice defendant. As defendant's consent to the search of his home was voluntary and intelligent, all evidence seized was admissible. A detective's testimony regarding defendant's confession was properly admitted. The trial court's failure to make findings of fact that the confession was voluntary was harmless error as the evidence established that defendant was fully warned of his rights, knowingly waived his rights, and voluntarily made a full confession. Though opinion testimony as to when dawn occurred on the date of the offense was improperly given by a detective, the error was harmless because defendant admitted he acted at night. Defendant's sentences were valid as they were within the maximum authorized by law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The orders convicting defendant of first degree burglary and larceny, and sentencing him to consecutive life imprisonment terms, were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant is charged in a bill of indictment, proper in form, with the first degree murder of James Alexander Howell on 5 January 1971.  He was first tried at the 29 March 1971 Session of Stanly Superior Court, convicted by the jury, and sentenced to death.  He appealed to the Supreme Court and we awarded a new trial for the reasons stated in that opinion, 280 N.C. 42, 185 S.E. 2d 123 (1971).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon motion by defendant, the case was transferred to Union County for retrial.  At his retrial, upon a plea of not guilty, defendant was again convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that on 5 January 1971 James Alexander Howell and his wife lived on Route 4 near Albemarle in Stanly County.  Mr. Howell worked six days a week from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m. as manager of a store.  On the morning in question he arose about 5 a.m., ate breakfast with his wife, and left the house to go to the store.  When Mrs. Howell failed to hear the truck door slam and failed to hear the motor start, she became concerned and went to the front door to investigate. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After calling to her husband and receiving no answer, she telephoned a neighbor, Gene Almond.  When Mr. Almond arrived at the Howell home they discovered Mr. Howell lying facedown alongside his truck.  The truck door on the driver's side was open and Mr. Howell's right foot was inside the truck.  He had been shot and died shortly thereafter.  An autopsy revealed that death resulted from a shotgun wound in the left chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers were called and arrived at the Howell home at 6:30 a.m. Their investigation revealed blood on the back of the front seat and inside the cab and shoe tracks in the vicinity and around the house.  A Halloween mask was found on an old sawmill road about 145 feet from the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tommy Clinton Peguese, a long-time friend and acquaintance of defendant, testified that on Sunday, 3 January 1971, he saw defendant at defendant's home in Albemarle with Tracy Baucom and Edward Richardson; that they rode around Albemarle in a car during which time defendant said he needed some money and Richardson asked him where he planned to get it; that defendant said &quot;he knew a man who either owned a chicken place or owned a store and run a chicken place and cashed checks&quot; near&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Endy vicinity; that the man would have from $ 800 to $ 2,000 and he was going to carry an iron pipe with him and hit him on the head with it; that &quot;he didn't give us an exact date or anything, but said it would be between 5:00 and 6:00 o'clock in the morning&quot;; that he asked defendant if he was serious and if he intended to carry a gun, &quot;and that's when he showed me the sawed-off shotgun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This witness further testified that several weeks later he saw defendant in Wadesboro in front of the Burmese Lounge and asked him &quot;if he had done what he had told me a few weeks ago and he looked at me and told me to keep my mouth closed and that was all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy Baucom testified that he was with Tommy Peguese, Edward Richardson and defendant on Sunday in early January 1971 when they rode around Albemarle in Tommy Peguese's car; that defendant &quot;was talking about the deal.  Something about some man that had some money or something.  I think he worked at that chicken place.  He said the man kept some money or had some at his house or somewhere . . . and he leaves home early in the morning going to work and supposed to be some kind of deal pulled off.&quot; This witness further testified that he saw&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant two or three weeks later and &quot;defendant said something about that deal or something didn't go right or something.  I don't know what he said, he just said it didn't go right.  He said something didn't go right and someone had to shoot or something and he didn't call any particular name or who it was.  He did not say who had been shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clarence Parsons testified that he managed the Burmese Lounge in Wadesboro; that he bought a sawed-off shotgun from defendant about the middle of January 1971 for $ 10.00, carried the gun home and kept it until he gave it to the sheriff and the SBI agent.  Frank Spencer, an employee at the Burmese Lounge, corroborated this testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony of Ralph McSwain, Sheriff of Stanly County, and SBI Agent Coppley tends to show that they went to the Howell residence at 6:10 a.m. and 6:30 a.m., respectively, on 5 January 1971 where they saw Mr. Howell's body and saw shoe impressions near the porch column and in tracks outside the dining room.  On 19 February 1971 at 5:30 a.m. defendant was arrested at his home on a capias incident to a worthless check charge.  The sheriff had obtained the shotgun the evening before, had interviewed the two witnesses&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Wadesboro, and had obtained a warrant charging defendant and Craven Turner, Jr. with Mr. Howell's murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following defendant's arrest, he was taken to the Stanly County Jail where the murder warrant was served on him and he was advised of his constitutional rights in full compliance with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda v. Arizona</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 384 U.S. 436, 16 L.Ed. 2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (1966). Defendant said he understood his constitutional rights and denied knowing anything about Mr. Howell's murder.  Sheriff McSwain thereupon left and went to the mill where Craven Turner, Jr. worked on the nightshift and arrested him on the murder charge at 8:05 a.m. Turner was fully advised of his constitutional rights, waived counsel, and made a full confession.  (See R pp 20-22 in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">State v. Craven Turner, Jr.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Case No. 6, Spring Term 1973.) Thereafter, about 10 a.m., the sheriff returned to the room where defendant was confined, again repeated the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings and defendant again stated he understood his rights.  Defendant was then told that his codefendant Craven Turner, Jr. would be brought into the room and would make a statement in the presence of defendant and that defendant did not have to say anything&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  during or after Turner's statement.  Turner was brought into the room and stated in the presence of the defendant and others that he and defendant Blackmon had gone to the Howell residence on the morning of 5 January 1971 and Blackmon had shot Mr. Howell.  Blackmon said to Turner, &quot;You got the gun out of the car.  You say I shot him?  Well, I say you shot him.&quot; Turner was immediately taken from the room and Sheriff McSwain asked defendant Blackmon, &quot;Do you care to make any further statement?&quot; The defendant replied, &quot;Well, I'm just going to tell you how it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Blackmon then made a detailed statement concerning the events which occurred at the Howell home on 5 January 1971.  In a continuous narrative he said that about a month before the killing Turner said he knew how to get some money, knew a man who carried money to cash checks on Tuesdays.  On the day before the robbery Turner drove the defendant by the Howell house three times.  Continuing his statement, defendant said Turner borrowed his shotgun on Saturday before the killing and picked up the defendant about 4:30 a.m. on the morning of 5 January 1971.  They drove to a point near the Howell residence in Turner's Chevelle&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  automobile, parked the car on a secondary road, and Turner put on a Halloween mask while defendant covered his face with a paper bag.  They walked across a field to the Howell home where defendant stayed in the edge of some woods while Turner approached the house and returned in a few minutes to state that the Howells were eating breakfast.  Turner concealed himself in the shrubbery and very soon Mr. Howell opened the door and came out on the front porch where he poured water out of a container and threw the container on the ground.  Shortly thereafter, defendant heard a shot and Turner came running from the house and stated, &quot;The old man went for his pocket and I had to shoot.&quot; They both ran across the field to the car, Turner falling in the field where he lost the Halloween mask and defendant falling in the creek &quot;and this is why mud was on the gun.&quot; Defendant heard on the radio about noon that Mr. Howell was dead.  When he later saw Turner and informed him of that fact, Turner said, &quot;He's just dead.  It was either him or me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant said he sold the sawed-off shotgun to Clarence Parsons in Wadesboro for $ 10.00.  He was shown the shotgun and Halloween mask and stated that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  gun was the weapon used at the Howell residence and the mask was the one worn by Turner during the robbery attempt.  Defendant also identified the pair of tennis shoes he was wearing on the morning of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter defendant voluntarily accompanied the officers to the scene of the crime, showed them the route he and Turner had followed, where they parked the car, the bush where defendant stood while Turner went around the Howell house, and the places where he and Turner fell while fleeing the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered evidence that Blackmon was twenty-five years old and Turner twenty-eight years old at the time Mr. Howell was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant interposed timely objection to the foregoing testimony of Sheriff McSwain and SBI Agent Coppley whereupon the jury was excused and the court conducted an extensive voir dire.  Evidence for the State on the voir dire was in substantial accord with the foregoing narration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified on voir dire that the sheriff and SBI Agent Coppley and a city policeman came to his home on the morning of 19 February 1971 about 5:30 a.m. and arrested him on a capias for a worthless check; that he was taken downtown to jail where the murder&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  warrant was read to him; that he told the sheriff, &quot;I won't answer nothing until I get a lawyer&quot;; that Sheriff McSwain said, &quot;Ain't no lawyer coming down here this time of morning, they in bed&quot;; that he was not advised of his constitutional rights; that he was shown the shotgun and told the officers he owned it at one time and sold it to Clarence Parsons; that he called his wife about 9:30 a.m. and told her to inform his mother and sister that he needed a lawyer.  He denied that Craven Turner, Jr. stated in his presence that he, Blackmon, shot Mr. Howell and asserted that the officers left defendant and Turner in the room together alone for about fifteen minutes.  He denied that the sheriff asked him if he cared to make any further statement, denied that he made an incriminating statement, and denied that he volunteered to go with the officers to the scene of the crime.  He admitted that he completed the eleventh grade in school, could read and write very well, and was not forced in any way to say anything and was made no promises.  He admitted he had served two prison sentences, six months for larceny and fifteen months for breaking probation, and said he was represented on one occasion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by Lawyer Pat Taylor who was employed by his mother and on another occasion by Lawyer Avery Hightower, employed by himself.  He admitted that he pleaded guilty in Cumberland County on two occasions for escape.  He stated that on 19 February 1971 he was employed and earning $ 100.00 a week.  He said he now knows his constitutional rights but did not know them on 19 February 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the voir dire the trial court made detailed findings of fact.  The court found, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that defendant was fully advised of his constitutional rights and said that he understood them; that immediately after defendant was so advised, Sheriff McSwain asked him about Mr. Howell's murder and defendant said he didn't know anything about it; that the sheriff thereupon left about 6:30 a.m. and posed no further questions; that during the sheriff's absence SBI Agent Coppley made one effort to interview defendant on the subject, and defendant said he didn't know anything about the matter; that no further questions were posed by Agent Coppley or any other officer until Sheriff McSwain returned about 10 a.m., again advised defendant of his constitutional rights and told him his co-defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Craven Turner, Jr. would be brought into the room and would make a statement in defendant's presence but further advised defendant that he did not have to say anything during or after Turner made said statement; that Turner was brought into the room and said that he and the defendant Blackmon had gone to the Howell residence and that the defendant had shot Howell; that at that point the defendant Blackmon said to his co-defendant Turner, &quot;You say I shot him?&quot; and Craven Turner, Jr. replied, &quot;Yes,&quot; and then the defendant Blackmon said, &quot;I say you shot him&quot;; that these words by the defendant Blackmon were made in response to the statement of Craven Turner, Jr. and were not the result of any questions put to him by any officer; that they were spontaneous in character and were made immediately after the statement by Craven Turner, Jr. to the effect that this defendant, Johnny James Blackmon, had shot Mr. Howell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court further found as a fact that defendant told Craven Turner, Jr., &quot;You got the gun out of the car&quot; and that this statement was not elicited by any questioning by the officers but was made in response to Turner's statement; that after Turner was removed from the room&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sheriff McSwain asked the defendant, &quot;Do you care to make any further statement?&quot; and defendant replied, &quot;I'll just tell you how it was.&quot; The court then found that defendant made the narrative statement detailed above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court found as a fact that the defendant was twenty-five years of age and had finished the eleventh grade in school; that he had held positions as a shipping clerk, as a truck driver, and could read and write very well; that he had been involved in a number of criminal cases, had been convicted of shoplifting, five counts of larceny, two escapes, and several motor vehicle violations, as a result of which he had been represented by competent counsel on at least two occasions prior to 19 February 1971 and had thus had considerable experience with criminal courts and criminal procedure; that at no time did defendant indicate that he wanted an attorney present or request anyone to obtain an attorney for him, and at no time did he affirmatively state that he did not want a lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based upon the findings of fact and the totality of the circumstances, the trial court concluded as a matter of law that defendant, after being fully advised of his constitutional rights, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  made the incriminating statements freely, understandingly and voluntarily without compulsion, duress or promise of leniency; that defendant by his words and deeds expressly waived his right to counsel and to keep silent by knowingly and intelligently making a free and voluntary confession immediately after he was advised of his rights, &quot;said confession having been spontaneously made in response to a statement made in his presence by co-defendant Craven Turner, Jr.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's objection to the testimony of Sheriff McSwain and Agent Coppley concerning his incriminating statement was thereupon overruled and said witnesses were permitted to testify before the jury as above narrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the State's evidence, defendant's motion for judgment of nonsuit was denied.  The jury was excused and defendant was fully advised of his right to testify and offer evidence in his own behalf.  Being so advised, defendant knowingly and understandingly informed the court that he had decided not to testify and that there were no witnesses he desired to call in his behalf.  He rested and renewed his motion for judgment of nonsuit which was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury convicted defendant of murder&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the first degree, and he was sentenced to death.  He appealed to the Supreme Court assigning errors discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a decision of the Superior Court of Union County (North Carolina), which convicted him of first-degree murder and imposed a sentence of death pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder with no recommendation that he receive a sentence of life imprisonment for the shooting of a robbery victim. Defendant asserted that incriminating statements he made were inadmissible because he was indigent at the time, charged with a capital offense, and had not waived his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel. The court affirmed the conviction for first-degree murder because it determined that statements that defendant made in response to a confession from his co-defendant, rather than from custodial interrogation, were voluntary statements that were admissible. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred when it gave the jury discretion to determine whether to convict for first-degree murder or first-degree murder with a recommendation of imprisonment for life. The court directed that the case be remanded for the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life because it determined that the offense was committed before N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17 had been changed to a mandatory death sentence and at a time when the discretion of the jury between life imprisonment and death was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The appeals were certified under G.S. 7A-31 (b) (1) for initial appellate review by the Supreme Court.  They were docketed and argued at the Spring Term as cases Nos. 89, 90, and 91.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These three separate proceedings were instituted in Wake County on 30 November 1972 under G.S. 143-309 (1964) and G.S. 159A-21 (1972) by a citizen and taxpayer of the respective counties of Northampton, Halifax, and Jones for judicial review of resolutions of the North Carolina Board of Conservation and Development determining that the creation of the Pollution Abatement and Industrial Facilities Financing Authority of each of the three counties is for a public purpose and approving bond issues by the Halifax and Northampton Authorities for pollution abatement facilities and by the Jones Authority for an industrial facility project.  The petitions for review challenge the constitutionality of the North Carolina Pollution Abatement and Industrial Facilities Financing Act, 1971 Session Laws, Chapter 633, codified as N. C. Gen. Stats., Ch. 159A, &sect;&sect; 159A-1 through&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  159A-25 (1972) and hereinafter referred to as &quot;the Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its beginning the Act recites the General Assembly's findings and determination (1) that full employment and prosperity in the State is dependent upon the expansion of industry, which is accompanied by increased noise and gaseous, liquid, and solid wastes which pollute the State's air, land, and waters; (2) that to control environmental pollution, which is menacing the citizens' health, safety, and welfare, the various levels of government must require and coordinate reduction, treatment, and disposal of pollutants; (3) that lack of employment opportunities in certain areas which have not shared in the State's general prosperity threatens the general safety, morals, and welfare; (4) that unemployment can best be eliminated by attracting and retaining private enterprises and stimulating industrial building programs in the depressed areas of the State; and (5) that in providing for the creation of county authorities which shall operate as corporate political subdivisions of the State for the purpose of (a) pollution control financing &quot;and/or&quot; (b) industrial facilities financing in the counties where employment opportunities&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are absent and wages and per capita income are below average, the General Assembly acts in the public interest and serves a public purpose.  G.S. 159A-2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">G.S. 159A-3 defines the significant terms used in the Act.  G.S. 159A-4 authorizes each county to create by resolution or ordinance &quot;a political subdivision and body corporate and politic of the State known as 'The ___ County Pollution Abatement and Industrial Facilities Financing Authority,'&quot; and specifies the manner of its establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting in strict compliance with the requirements of G.S. 159A-3, by resolution adopted 1 November 1971, the Board of Commissioners of Jones County created the Jones County Pollution Abatement and Industrial Facilities Financing Authority (Jones Authority).  On 6 March 1972 the Halifax County and Northampton County Pollution Abatement and Industrial Facilities Financing Authorities (Halifax Authority and Northampton Authority) were similarly created.  Each resolution authorized the Authority created to issue its bonds for pollution control purposes and industrial facility financing purposes, pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within 120 days after the creation of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  three authorities, as required by G.S. 159A-4 (f), each Authority, stating the basis for the request, applied to the State Board of Conservation and Development (Board) for a determination that the Authority's proposed operation is for a public purpose.  At the Board's quarterly meeting on 13 May 1972, after investigation and advertisement as required by G.S. 159A-4 (f), in separate resolutions the Board made the findings of fact and conclusions summarized below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c11">Jones County</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  The proposed operation of the Jones Authority is for a public purpose for that (1) substantial stream pollution of the Trent and White Oak rivers now exists within the county; and (2) the county is a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">distressed area</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> within the meaning of G.S. 159A-3 (6a) a, b, c, d, and f, in that (a) during the immediately preceding calendar year with respect to which published reports are available the established rate of unemployment among the labor force of the county was at least 6%; (b) the estimated average manufacturing wage of factory production workers in the county was at least 10% less than the State average for the same period; (c) the estimated average per capita personal income in the county was 10% less&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  than the State average for the same period; (d) the county has suffered a 1% or more loss of population between 1960 and 1970; and (f) the county is eligible for assistance under &quot;Section 401 (a) of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (Public Laws 89-136, Title IV, 401).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c11">Halifax County</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  The proposed operation of the Halifax Authority is for a public purpose for that (1) substantial air, water, and noise pollution now exists within the county, and (2) the county is a distressed area within the meaning of G.S. 159A-3 (6a), c, d, and f.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c11">Northampton County</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  The proposed operation of the Northampton Authority is for a public purpose for that (1) substantial air, water, and noise pollution now exists within the county; and (2) the county is a distressed area within the meaning of G.S. 159A-3 (6a), a, b, c, d, and f.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No challenge was made to the foregoing findings of fact or conclusions of law as provided in G.S. 159A-4 (f) and G.S. 143-309 and the Board's findings of fact are not in controversy now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the powers which G.S. 159A-5 confers upon an authority is the power (1) to acquire, by any means except eminent domain, real and personal property for use&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as, or in conjunction with, any industrial facility, pollution control or abatement facility, water management or solid waste disposal facility, and research facilities related to manufacturing, processing manufactured, agricultural, mineral, and animal products (&quot;projects&quot; as defined in G.S. 159A-5); (2) to construct, acquire, own, lease, or renovate one or more projects and to sell, lease, exchange, &quot;or otherwise dispose of&quot; projects; (3) to issue its bonds to provide funds to pay all or part of any project or to refund bonds already issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An authority's project must be located within the county for which it was created.  G.S. 159A-6.  No project financed under the Act may be operated by an authority, the State, or any of its subdivisions.  Such projects must be leased for operation and maintenance under a lease in form and substance as provided in G.S. 159A-7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before an authority may issue bonds to finance a project G.S. 159A-21 requires it to obtain the Board's approval of the proposed project.  To approve a project the Board must find: (1) The conditions upon which it based its original conclusion that the creation of the authority was for a public purpose have not changed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  materially.  (2) The proposed project, according to information available, will (i) alleviate specific pollution conditions or (ii) &quot;will alleviate or tend to alleviate&quot; the conditions of below average manufacturing wage, per capita income, or high unemployment and make a significant contribution to the economic growth of the county and advance the prosperity and public welfare of the county and State; and (3) The proposed project will not cause the abandonment of an industrial or research facility existing elsewhere in the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Board approves the proposed project G.S. 159A-21 requires that it publish notice of its findings and approval in a newspaper of general circulation in the county for which the authority was created.  Within 30 days after such publication G.S. 159A-21 provides that the Board's findings and approval may be reviewed in the Superior Court of Wake County as provided by G.S. 143-309.  If no &quot;person who is aggrieved&quot; by such findings and approval petitions for review within the prescribed 30 days, the statute declares that the authority to issue the bonds and the legality thereof &quot;shall be conclusively presumed, and no court shall have authority to inquire&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  into such matters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the Board's approval of a bond issue an authority must obtain the approval of the Local Government Commission of North Carolina before it is empowered to issue the bonds.  G.S. 159A-12.  This statute also prescribes the manner in which the form, terms, rate of interest, execution, and sale of the bonds shall be determined, and it requires the proceeds of each bond issued to be used solely for the purposes for which the bonds were issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any bonds issued under the Act &quot;shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the State or of any political subdivision or of any agency thereof or a pledge of the faith and credit of the State or of any political subdivision or of any such agency, but shall be payable solely from the revenues, proceeds, and other funds pledged therefor.&quot; G.S. 159A-11 (a).  Further, the expenses of an authority, incurred in carrying out the provisions of the Act, are payable only from project revenues, bond sale proceeds, and contributions made to the authority.  G.S. 159A-11 (b).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">G.S. 159A-8 provides that, except for gift and inheritance taxes, any bonds issued by an authority pursuant to the Act, their transfer, and the income&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  therefrom (including any profit made on a sale thereof) shall be exempt from all taxation by the State or any subdivision or agency thereof.  An authority is exempt from both income and property taxes, but the statute requires authority's lessee to list the lease-hold interest for taxation at &quot;the same value as the fee interest in that property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 3 October 1972, proceeding under G.S. 159A-21, the Halifax Authority applied to the Board for permission to issue bonds for pollution control purposes in the amount of $ 13,400,000.  On 4 October 1972, the Northampton Authority applied for approval of a bond issue for the same purpose in the amount of $ 2,500,000.  The Jones Authority, on 29 September 1972, applied for approval of a bond issue in the amount of $ 3,000,000 for the purpose of financing industrial facilities.  Thus, in cases Nos. 80 and 81, pollution control bonds only are involved; in case No. 82, industrial bonds only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation which prompted the Halifax and Northampton Authorities to propose the bond issues for which they seek approval is summarized below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Albemarle Paper Company (Albemarle), a Delaware corporation, doing business in North Carolina is a wholly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  owned subsidiary of Hoerner-Waldorf Corporation (Hoerner-Waldorf), also a Delaware corporation doing business in this State.  Albemarle is engaged in the manufacture of paper and paper products in Northampton and Halifax counties.  Its mill is located on the Roanoke River in Roanoke Rapids, Halifax County, directly across the river from the town of Gaston in Northampton County.  The mill, which has been in operation for many years, now employs 700 people on a three-shift, seven-day per week basis, 360 days per year.  Each day it produces about 937 tons of unbleached Kraft pulp and paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mill's annual air polution emissions are approximately 6.6 million pounds of particulate matter, 5.6 million pounds of odorous sulphur compounds, and 10.5 million pounds of sulphur dioxide.  The particulate includes a fine white ash which corrodes the finish on every automobile and causes the paint to peel from houses and all other structures.  These air pollutants have a sharp, disagreeable odor which permeates the air and invades every enclosure for miles around.  Albemarle's air pollution control devices provide no control for odors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albemarle daily discharges liquid effluent (sewage and waste&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  water containing dissolved and suspended solids) into the river.  These water pollution emissions are noxious and deleterious to the health and property of the citizens of Halifax and Northampton counties.  This waste, which &quot;flows in million gallons per day,&quot; is chemically reduced by natural biological activity.  Microorganisms in the river, while consuming this waste, also consume the oxygen dissolved in the river.  The uncontrolled discharge of waste into the river reduces dissolved oxygen to the point where aquatic life cannot exist.  Such discharges from Albemarle's mill have, from time to time, resulted in massive fish kills in the river, the last recorded one having occurred in April 1972.  In April 1963 a discharge by Albemarle killed an estimated 57,200 fish.  Wood sugar dissolved in Albemarle's waste water causes slime bacteria to develop in spectacular proportions.  Green slime pervades the river and covers the lines of fishermen.  Below the mill the river carries the same terrible odors as the mill itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On account of both its air and water pollution emissions Albemarle is now and has been conducting its operations in violation of the laws and regulations of the State&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 30 June 1969 Albemarle's permit (issued 18 September 1964) to discharge effluent into the river expired.  Between that date and 26 November 1971, the record indicates that the company continued to discharge pollutants into the river without a permit.  On 26 November 1971, in accordance with N.C. Gen. Stats., Ch. 143, art. 21 (1971 Supp.), Albemarle applied to the State Board of Water and Air Resources for a permit to construct an &quot;Effluent and Treatment System,&quot; which would meet legal requirements and treat all the liquid waste from Albemarle's mill and for a permit to discharge waste from the proposed treatment plant into the river.  The application stated that &quot;the proposed works,&quot; would be completed and in operation on or before 15 September 1973.  The estimated cost of this facility, to be constructed partly in Halifax County and partly in Northampton County, was $ 3,380,000.  The cost of the Halifax portion was estimated to be $ 880,000; the Northampton portion, $ 2,500,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the basis of the foregoing application, on 2 March 1972, the Water and Air Resources Board issued to Albemarle a conditional permit, effective until 31 December 1976, to construct&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the proposed waste water treatment facility and to discharge the treated effluent into the river.  One of the conditions imposed was that the proposed facility be completed and in operation on or before 15 September 1973.  The permit directed that the &quot;existing wastewater treatment facility&quot; be maintained and operated &quot;so as to effect overall reductions in pollution and to produce an effluent of such quality as to protect the receiving stream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 3 May 1972 the Board of Water and Air Resources issued a temporary permit to Albemarle &quot;for exact planning&quot; of an air pollution control project for its plant in Roanoke Rapids to be located entirely in Halifax County and to cost $ 12,520,000.  It is to finance this air pollution project and also the $ 880,000 portion of the Albemarle water treatment system to be constructed in Halifax County that the Halifax Authority proposes to issue revenue bonds in the sum of $ 13,400,000.  It is to finance the construction of that portion of the water treatment system to be located in Northampton County that the Northampton Authority proposes to issue revenue bonds in the amount of $ 2,500,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The construction of the air and water pollution control&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  facilities for which permits have been issued to Albemarle is necessary to bring it in compliance with the applicable statutes, rules, and regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 1 September 1972 the Halifax and Northampton Authorities, Albemarle, and Hoerner-Waldorf entered into a contract with reference to these facilities under which the respective authority, pursuant to the Act, would acquire the site, finance and construct that portion of the project located in its county and, upon terms consistent with G.S. 159A-7, lease the facilities to Albemarle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c11">Inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the contract provides that (1) the implementation and legal effectiveness of the agreement are wholly dependent upon the successful resolution of the legal questions with respect to the power of the Authorities to issue revenue bonds; (2) this power and the legality of the bonds having been established, the Authorities will authorize and sell the bonds as soon as practicable; (3) the proceeds from the sale of the bonds will be applied to the acquisition and construction costs of the pollution control facilities, including the reimbursement of Albemarle of moneys expended by it in connection with such acquisition and construction; (4) should&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the proposed financing arrangement fail for any reason to materialize or to be completed successfully Albemarle will indemnify the Authorities for any expenses incurred up to the time the program is terminated; (5) Hoerner-Waldorf will execute to the trustee for the bondholders an unconditional guaranty that the principal of the bonds, any premium, and the interest thereon will be promptly paid as the same become due.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospective lease agreement, attached to the contract as an exhibit, provided, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that Albemarle will (1) maintain the facilities, (2) pay to the Authorities a rental sufficient &quot;to pay the principal of, interest on, and redemption premium, if any, on the bonds&quot; when the same become due and also &quot;all costs, fees, and expenses&quot; incurred by the Authorities in providing the financing of the facilities and performing their obligations under the contract-lease agreements; (3) pay ad valorem taxes lawfully assessed on its leasehold interest; (4) be obligated to purchase the facilities for the sum of $ 100 at the termination of the lease following full payment of the bonds (or upon specified contingencies not here material); and (5) have the option after ten&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  years from the date the final installment of the first year's rental obligation is payable under the lease, to purchase the facilities for a sum sufficient to redeem the bonds, to pay all expenses incident thereto, and any obligations payable under the agreements with the Authorities, plus $ 100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts motivating the Jones Authority to seek approval of the industrial facilities bonds which it proposes to issue in the amount of $ 3,000,000 are summarized below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albemarle has proposed to construct and operate in Jones County a lumber plant which will (1) cost approximately $ 3,000,000; (2) produce 30,000,000 board feet of air-dried, planed dimension lumber on a 245-day, 3-shift operation; (3) employ 83 people at an average wage of $ 160 per week; (4) activate 10-15 logging firms in the area which will employ 150 people at &quot;wages probably exceeding the average Jones County wage&quot;; (5) provide &quot;stumpage benefits for landowners&quot;; and (6) provide $ 30,000 annually in lieu of ad valorem taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jones Authority, Albemarle, and Hoerner-Waldorf have entered into an agreement in which the Jones Authority agrees to issue revenue bonds to finance the construction of the lumber plant, which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it will own in fee and lease to Albemarle by a lease agreement consistent with G.S. 159A-7.  There is no substantial difference between this contract and the lease agreement and the contract and lease agreement which Albemarle and Hoerner-Waldorf made with the Halifax and Northampton Authorities.  Hoerner-Waldorf also guarantees Albemarle's performance of its contractual obligations to the Jones Authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 14 October 1972 the Board made the findings required by G.S. 159A-21 and approved the application of each of the three Authorities to issue its revenue bonds for the respective project in aid of Albemarle.  Thereafter notice of the Board's findings and approval of the bond issues was duly published.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within thirty days after the Board published notice of its approval of the bond issues proposed by the Halifax, Northampton, and Jones Authorities, in strict compliance with G.S. 159A-21 and G.S. 143-309, petitioners instituted these three proceedings for judicial review of the Board's findings and conclusions.  Each petitioner alleges that he is a person aggrieved by the Board's approval of the bond issue proposed by his county's Authority and that he is entitled to judicial review&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Board's action as provided in G.S. 143-307 (1964).  Defendants admit this allegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioner in case No. 80, John H. Stanley, is a citizen and resident of Northampton County, where he owns real and personal property upon which he pays both municipal and county ad valorem taxes.  To the State of North Carolina he pays income, sales, and intangible taxes and a privilege tax to practice medicine.  He engages in farming operations in Northampton County which require him to borrow money from time to time and to execute notes therefor which are not tax exempt.  He owns stock and securities in one or more North Carolina corporations which own real and personal property in the State and which have issued bonds which are not tax exempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner in case No. 81, Charles M. Edwards, is a citizen and resident of Halifax County, where he is engaged in the real estate business and owns a trailer park.  Except for his occupation no material difference exists between his situation, status, and holdings and that of petitioner in case No. 80.  Petitioner in case No. 82 is Charles Ray Henderson, a citizen and resident of Jones County, a salaried employee and the owner of a farm and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***19]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vineyard in Jones County.  Except for his occupation, his situation is likewise not materially different from that of the other two petitioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each petitioner alleges that the Act is unconstitutional, and any bonds issued under it are invalid in that the Act (1) violates Article V, Section 2 (1) of the North Carolina Constitution and the due process and equal protection clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions by authorizing the use of the proceeds of revenue bonds for other than public purposes; (2) violates Article V, Section 3 (2) of the Constitution by lending the credit of the State without a vote of the people; (3) violates Article V, Section 2 (5) and 4 of the Constitution by creating a debt of the State or a county without a vote of the people; (4) violates Article V, Section 2 (3) of the Constitution by exempting from taxation the property of an entity that is not a municipal corporation; (5) violates Article I, Section 6 and Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution by unlawfully delegating legislative authority to the created Authorities, the Department and Board of Conservation and Development, and the Local Government Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Superior Court these three&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***20]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cases were consolidated for trial and heard by Judge Hobgood on the pleadings and stipulations.  The facts as hereinabove stated are either alleged and admitted in the pleadings or are set out in the stipulations.  Additionally, the parties made the following stipulations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Each of the Authorities entered into the agreements with Albemarle and Hoerner-Waldorf without any finding by the Authorities or by the Board of Conservation and Development that Albemarle is unable to finance the proposed projects without the assistance of the Authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. The revenue bonds which the Authorities propose to issue, the income therefrom, and the transfer and profits from the sale thereof, &quot;are declared exempt&quot; from all State and Federal taxation except inheritance and gift taxes and tax-exempt bonds carry a lower interest rate than bonds of like quality which are not tax exempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. The issuance of tax-exempt bonds rather than corporate bonds will reduce tax revenues to local, State, and Federal governments; and petitioners, as taxpayers, &quot;are constitutionally entitled to require that the proceeds from tax-exempt bonds be used for a public purpose and to be free from the additional burden placed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***21]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon [them] as taxpayers by the granting of tax exemptions other than for a public purpose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the hearing Judge Hobgood adopted the stipulations in each case.  In Nos. 80 and 81 he decreed that the Act violates none of the constitutional provisions upon which petitioners rely and that the tax-exempt bonds which the Halifax and Northampton Authorities propose to issue for pollution abatement purposes are for a public purpose and lawful.  In case No. 82 he adjudged (1) that the Act, insofar as it pertains to the financing of industrial facility projects, violates N. C. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(1), the due process and equal protection clauses of N. C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution; and (2) that the issuance of taxexempt bonds pursuant to the Act for industrial facilities purposes is unlawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this Court the three appeals were consolidated for argument and decision.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Cases Nos. 80 and 81, reversed and remanded.  Case No. 82, affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner taxpayers brought separate actions challenging the constitutionality of the North Carolina Pollution Abatement and Industrial Facilities Financing Act (act), N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 159A-1 through 159A-25 (1972). The Superior Court of Wake County (North Carolina) held that the act was unconstitutional only as applied to the financing of industrial facility projects and not as to the financing of pollution abatement. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent financing authority alleged that its actions promoted the public interest by assisting the economic welfare and resources of the involved areas by providing direct aid to private industry. On appeal, the court held that the creation of county authorities to finance pollution abatement and control facilities, or industrial facilities, for private industry by the issuance of tax-exempt revenue bonds was not for a public purpose. It did not follow that because the state had the power to order an industry to abate a nuisance or cease operations that it could constitutionally assist the industry in financing the abatement. The benefit to the public was only incidental or secondary. State aid to private industry in the form of tax-exempt revenue bond financing was unconstitutional. The act, which purported to authorize such financing, violated N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(1). The state could not directly aid the private industry by tax-exemption of bonds for plant construction, and it could not indirectly accomplish the same purpose by authorizing the creation of an authority to issue the tax-exempt revenue bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgments to the extent that they found the aid of pollution abatement to be constitutional and remanded the cases for entry of judgments in favor of the taxpayers. The court affirmed the judgments to the extent that they found the aid for industrial facility projects to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon three bills of indictment which were consolidated for trial.  Bill No. 37019, drawn under G.S. 15-144, charged that on 7 June 1972 defendant &quot;did kill and murder Bobby Taylor.&quot; Bill No. 37020, drawn under G.S. 14-32 (a), charged that on 7 June 1972 defendant feloniously assaulted Robert Michael Martin with a pistol.  Bill No. 37021, drawn under G.S. 14-87, charged that on 7 June 1972 defendant by means of a pistol feloniously robbed Robert Michael Martin of $ 6.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tended to show the following facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 7 June 1972 Robert Michael Martin (Martin) and Bobby Taylor, employees of the Charlotte Park and Recreation Commission, went to the Bonnie Brae Golf Course in Charlotte to play golf.  At approximately 12:04 p.m. they began play on the No. 1 hole.  After playing the first three holes, they arrived at the fourth hole at about 12:45 p.m. There Martin observed two black men sitting on a bench five-to-six yards to the right of the tee.  From the fourth tee Martin drove a 200-yard shot which landed on the left side of the fairway.  Bobby&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Taylor's drive landed on the extreme right toward the woods.  The two men walked off the tee together for about 100 yards and then separated, each going toward his own ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Martin waited for Taylor to hit his second shot a black male, later identified as defendant, came up behind Martin, pointed a gun at him, and demanded his money.  Martin reached for his wallet but defendant said, &quot;No, walk in the woods.&quot; Martin looked across the fairway and observed another black man behind Taylor with a golf club in his hand.  As defendant walked Martin across the fairway he called to Taylor, telling him not to move or he would shoot and kill Martin.  Taylor froze and did not move until Martin and defendant approached.  Then, Martin and Taylor marched single file into the woods with defendant, gun in hand, following two or three feet behind.  The other man entered the woods with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group walked about 75 yards down a slope into the woods.  At that point defendant ordered Martin and Taylor to lie on the ground, face down with their heads pointing up the hill.  While the other man tied their feet defendant stood in front of the two men, about four feet from their heads.  He was cursing, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  waving the gun in their faces, and saying he wanted their money.  As Martin got out his wallet, which contained only six or seven dollars, the unidentified man grabbed it from his hand.  Taylor had no wallet with him.  The only money on his person was a little pocket change which he gave to defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Infuriated because Martin and Taylor had no more money, defendant said he was going to kill them both so that they could not go to the police.  Taylor offered to give him his car keys and to write him a check.  These offers infuriated defendant further, and he walked back and forth from Martin's feet to Taylor's head saying, &quot;I'm going to shoot you, shoot you.&quot; After kicking Taylor twice in the face and once in the ribs defendant announced that he was going to kill him first.  During this time Martin was lying beside Taylor, propped up on his elbows, watching all that went on.  Taylor was in the same position.  All the while the unidentified man was standing directly behind them, a raised golf club in his hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ignoring the pleas of both men to leave them alone, defendant put his gun to Taylor's neck and fired.  He then &quot;walked around to the front&quot; and shot Taylor in the head.  Stepping&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the right he shot Martin twice in the head, backed up, and shot Taylor again.  After that he stepped backwards and once more pointed the pistol at Martin, but it did not go off.  Defendant then ran away; the other man left when defendant fired the first shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, who was still conscious, untied his feet.  After determining that Taylor was dead he ran out of the woods.  His cries attracted the attention of several golfers who carried him to the clubhouse where they called the police and an ambulance.  At the hospital, doctors removed from Martin's head two bullets which were &quot;lodged right on the bone of the skull through the meaty part of the scalp.&quot; Martin was hospitalized for six or seven days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An autopsy revealed that Taylor had been shot once in the neck at point-blank range and twice in the head.  The medical examiner testified that any one of the three wounds could have been fatal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A firearms identification specialist testified that two of the bullets removed from Taylor and one from Martin were fired from the same gun.  The other bullets which were removed were too mutilated for a positive identification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Martin was in the hospital, on five or six occasions, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he was shown a total of 85-100 photographs of black men.  From these he identified defendant as the man who had shot him and Taylor.  On June 10th, Martin was taken to the police station on a stretcher to observe a lineup.  In it he identified defendant as the man who had shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After conducting an extensive </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Judge Friday found that Martin's in-court identification of defendant was based solely on his observation of his assailant at the time of the &quot;alleged robbery&quot; at the Bonnie Brae Golf Course; that his in-court identification was not influenced by any out-of-court confrontation, lineup, or suggestive use of photographs; and that there was no evidence of any illegal or suggestive pretrial procedures conducive to a mistaken identification.  Upon this finding he permitted Martin to identify defendant as one of the two men who had robbed him on the golf course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In court Martin positively identified defendant as the man who shot him and Taylor and who robbed them both.  He testified that he was unable to identify the man who tied his and Taylor's feet and, so far as the record discloses, this man remains unidentified.  Martin testified that he was in defendant's presence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for a total of ten minutes, and that he looked at him directly for six or seven of those minutes while defendant faced him holding &quot;that gun&quot; in his face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willie Taylor, a black who was playing golf at the Bonnie Brae Golf Course on the morning of 7 June 1972, teed off from hole No. 4 at approximately 11:45 a.m. At that time he saw two men sitting on a bench to the left of that tee.  Thinking that he knew one of them he looked at him a good while and ascertained that the man was not the person he thought he was.  He testified that he was positive defendant was the man he observed on the seat at the fourth tee about quarter of twelve on 7 June 1972.  He had never seen defendant before that date, and he has not seen the other man since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered the testimony of six witnesses which tended to show that on 7 June 1972 defendant was in their presence on or in the vicinity of South Tryon Street (and therefore not at the golf course) from 9:00 a.m. to about 11:00 a.m. and between noon and 12:30 to 1:00 p.m. Defendant himself did not testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found defendant &quot;guilty of the offense of murder of Bobby Taylor in the perpetration of a felony,&quot; &quot;guilty of the offense of assaulting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Robert M. Martin with a deadly weapon with intent to kill resulting in serious bodily injury,&quot; and &quot;guilty of the offense of robbing Robert M. Martin with a firearm.&quot; The judgment of the court was that defendant be imprisoned for thirty years for robbery with a firearm; that he be imprisoned for ten years for felonious assault; and that he be imprisoned for the remainder of his natural life for first-degree murder, this sentence to begin at the expiration of the sentence imposed for felonious assault.  From these judgments defendant gave notice of appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant appeals to this Court as a matter of right under G.S. 7A-27(a) in case No. 37019.  Upon defendant's motion, in our discretion, under G.S. 7A-31(a), we certified cases Nos. 37020 and 37021 for review by this Court prior to their determination by the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On defendants' appeal from, and on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> granted on plaintiff's petition to review, the decision of the Court of Appeals reported in 16 N.C. App. 70, 191 S.E. 2d 419, docketed and argued in this Court as No. 85 at Fall Term 1972.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howard G. Bowen, Sr., as plaintiff-administrator, instituted this action against Constructors Equipment Rental Company (Rental Company) and James Stephen Wilson (Wilson) to recover damages on account of the alleged wrongful death of his intestate, Howard Gibson Bowen, Jr. (Howard).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howard was killed instantly by electrocution on 26 June 1969 while working as an employee of Samet Construction Company (Construction Company).  The fatal accident occurred when the cable of a crane owned by Rental Company and operated by Wilson came in contact with a high tension line.  Howard was seventeen years old, had graduated from high school in June of 1969, and was temporarily employed as a laborer pending his admission to college in the fall of 1969.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleged Howard's death was proximately caused by the negligence of Rental Company and Wilson and prayed that he recover $ 351,691.82 for damages sustained on account of Howard's wrongful death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a joint answer, Rental Company and Wilson denied actionable negligence on their part.  As a further defense, they asserted that plaintiff's action was barred by Howard's contributory negligence.  They also alleged that negligence on the part of Construction Company was a proximate cause of Howard's death and a bar to recovery to the extent of the payments made by Construction Company and its compensation carrier pursuant to the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only evidence was introduced by plaintiff.  Summarized, except when quoted, it is set forth below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Construction Company, as general contractor, was engaged in the construction of a building for Visual Presentations, Inc., on Kettering Road in High Point.  Kettering Road ran generally east and west and had been paved, curbed and guttered.  There was no sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 26 June 1969 the building was in &quot;the finishing stages.&quot; The front was 50 feet south of the property line and approximately 60 feet back from the south curb of Kettering Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The natural flow of water was toward the north.  Water had been caught in a manhole located thirty-six feet and four inches north of the newly constructed building and twenty-one&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  feet and eight inches back from the south curb.  From this manhole, the water flowed under Kettering Road into the city's storm sewer system.  The interference with the natural flow caused by the project required that catch basins be constructed and that storm sewer lines be installed to carry the water from the catch basins to the manhole.  A catch basin was located east of the building and southeast of the manhole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to 26 June 1969, a ditch, about one hundred feet long and &quot;probably ten feet deep at its deepest point,&quot; had been dug by a backhoe.  This ditch extended from the manhole diagonally across the front of the property to the catch basin to the east of the building.  The storm sewer was to consist of reinforced concrete pipe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had been raining prior to the time the pipe was delivered.  The delivery truck could not &quot;get in there [next to the ditch] because it was so muddy.  They put the pipe right down under the power lines.&quot; Except for two or three sections of forty-two inch pipe, each section was thirty inches in diameter, was three or four feet long, and &quot;weighed 1400 or 1500 pounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to lay the pipe it was necessary to use a crane.  Construction Company&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  did not own a crane but arranged to rent one, along with an operator, from Rental Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[A]bout two days prior&quot; to the accident, Odell Couch, the job foreman, called Rental Company to make arrangements for renting a crane.  Shortly thereafter, a Mr. Tucker of Rental Company visited the job site.  Later Wilson (the crane operator) arrived with &quot;a large stationary boom crane.&quot; Tucker and Wilson decided this crane was not suitable for the job and advised Couch that they would send out a smaller crane the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson testified: &quot;[W]hen we had the other crane over there, Mr. Tucker mentioned that the reason we had to take the other one back was because this crane was too big to maneuver on the job, and that because of the wires we would need . . . a smaller crane.  . . . The [larger] crane had a sixty-foot stationary boom, and the Groves TM 120 hydraulic crane had about a twenty-foot boom that could be extended sixty feet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day of the accident the weather was good.  Wilson arrived just before noon with the smaller hydraulic crane.  Couch asked either Tucker or Wilson &quot;if he would like us to move the pipe [out from under the power lines], and he said that he could&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  do it from there.&quot; He initially positioned the crane &quot;four or five feet [south] of the curb line of Kettering Road&quot; on the west side of the manhole.  Couch warned Wilson about the wires which were directly over the stack of pipe and also warned the employees of Construction Company to be careful around the power lines.  He did not ask the power company to cut off the power while the crane was being operated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to lift the pipe, a &quot;finger or hairpin or hook&quot; type of device furnished by Construction Company was attached to the crane cable.  According to Norman Samet, president of Construction Company, this device weighed &quot;a hundred pounds, or close to it.&quot; However, Wilson thought that the &quot;approximate weight of the finger itself would probably be 20 pounds.&quot; Howard's job, at the time of the accident, was to insert the &quot;hook&quot; into the &quot;female end of the pipe.&quot; As each section of pipe was removed from the stack and placed in the ditch other employees of Construction Company would join and interlock the pipe in tongue and groove fashion.  Twelve sections had been so removed and located prior to the accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the initial location Wilson moved about four or five sections of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pipe.  Describing how the crane moved these pipes, Couch testified that Wilson &quot;extended the boom out and of course the cable will pick up real close to the boom, and it was out to an angle enough to get under the wires and not do nothing&quot;; and that &quot;[a]t no time in the operation of the crane and in the installation of this pipe when it was located on the west side of the ditch [it was on the east side when the accident occurred] did Mr. Wilson ever extend the boom up to the height of the wires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After these four or five sections were placed in the ditch, Wilson moved the crane to a location east of the manhole.  To do this &quot;he had to fold the crane back in . . . the outlets and boom and all, and he went out into the street and came back in on the southeast side of the ditch&quot; to a position about thirty feet from the curb of Kettering Road and aligned slightly to the east of the northeast corner of the building.  It was at this location when the accident occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Couch testified that he had &quot;stood out there for almost two hours or so watching the crane in operation.&quot; During this time from &quot;three or four feet&quot; was as close as the crane got to the power lines.  He further testified: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;As to whether at any time during the operation of the crane when I observed it at the second site at that time, did he ever extend the boom up to the height of the wires, not to my knowledge, not until I saw the accident.  I didn't actually see the accident.&quot; Samet testified that the weight of the pipe &quot;was very, very light compared to the capacity of the crane so that it would have the capacity to lift this small weight at a very low angle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before the accident, Couch had to leave the construction site for about ten minutes.  When he returned he went into the shack on the job site to make a telephone call.  During Couch's absence Samet arrived on the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Samet arrived the crane was in operation at the location east of the manhole and in the process of laying a section of pipe in the ditch.  As Samet was standing near the crane Wilson swung the crane back to get the next piece of pipe which was on the ground &quot;right near the curb on Kettering Road.&quot; Samet testified: &quot;I looked up and saw that the boom of the crane was up very high and . . . was moving very close to the power lines, and almost at the same instant as he was swinging around there seemed to be only a slight&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hesitation as it got very near the power line and then it moved closer to the power line, and the next thing I knew there was an electrical buzzing and arcing noise.  . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samet further testified: &quot;After I heard this electrical sound and at the time I looked at Howard . . . he was probably five feet south of the south curb line of Kettering Road.  . . . The top of the boom was above the power lines.  At that time, the cable was against the power lines&quot; touching the line &quot;only a few feet off of the pole.  . . .&quot; With reference to how high the boom extended above the wires at that time, Samet was of the opinion that there was &quot;maybe 18 inches of the cable hanging down from the roller of the sheave&quot; to the point of contact with the power line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samet further testified: &quot;I looked up and saw the wire in contact with the cable from the crane, in contact with the electrical wires -- and I looked down and saw [Howard] . . . standing very close to this fork or finger that was hanging from the cable.  At that time, I couldn't tell for sure if he was touching this piece of metal or not because of the angle and the distance.  . . . I screamed his name, I believe, and ran around the crane, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and he started moving away from this piece of metal, the fork, and appeared to be running from it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under cross-examination, Samet testified that he did not see Howard with his hand on the hook or see him pull the hook over under the power line in order to put it into the pipe; that although he had a clear vision, he was not looking at the &quot;hook&quot; at that time; and that he did not see Howard until after he saw the sparks and could not tell whether he had pulled the hook over toward the pipes.  With reference to his previous testimony under oath that it appeared to him that Howard had his hand on the &quot;hook,&quot; it did so appear to him but he could not be real sure; that Howard was erect, standing still, and appeared to have his hand on it, but he was not sure that Howard was touching it.  At that time, Howard &quot;was standing just about right under the wires, approximately.&quot; As far as Samet could tell, there was not anything that would have obstructed Howard's view of the crane and the wires.  Too, he could have observed the sign [warning of danger in operating near power lines] on the side of the crane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Couch had completed his telephone call.  Just as he walked out of the office&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he heard the &quot;buzzing noise&quot; and saw the boom which was &quot;right straight up over the wire&quot; moving back away from the wires.  He was unable to see Howard at this time because a truck obstructed his view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Couch further testified: &quot;As to whether I had seen [Howard] holding onto this metal piece guiding it toward the pieces of pipe earlier, yes.  As to whether he would hold onto this fork or hook and would guide it over to a piece of pipe, well, not necessarily.  The crane would put the fork over there and he would push it inside.  As to whether I just said that I had seen [Howard] with his hand on this fork or finger guiding it or moving it toward the pipe, placing it into the pipe, yes, sir.  As to whether I saw him guiding or moving it toward the pipe on occasions, well, I really don't know whether he was moving it or whether the crane was.  I couldn't say that, but he was guiding the fork.  I saw him with his hand on it as it was moving.  As to whether the cable which was attached to this hook was such that the cable could swing from side to side, yes, sir, I assume it could swing from one way or the other.  At the time of the accident, there was nothing in the area that would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prevent [Howard] if he looked from seeing the crane, the cable and the wire.  I had specifically warned him about the dangers of those wires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On redirect examination, Couch emphasized that the closest he &quot;saw it [the crane] get to the wire was actually about three or four feet&quot; and that at no time did he &quot;ever see the boom ever extend up to the height of these wires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his testimony in the adverse examination introduced by plaintiff, Wilson, the crane operator, described the accident as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After we had set the last piece of pipe, I was swinging around to where the other pipe was laying, and I had the hook about a foot or so off the ground, and [Howard] was steadying it, and just walking along beside it, more or less, and when I got close to the other pipe, he started to pull this finger thing toward a piece of pipe, and when I seen him doing this I stopped swinging, but it was too late.  The cable was in the line, so I swung back the other way, and [Howard] started to run, and he ran about 6 foot and fell to the ground.&quot; [This conflicts with Samet's testimony that as the crane moved toward the wire there was a slight hesitation and then the boom moved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">closer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the wire.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson further testified: &quot;As to what height I was booming at that time, the tip of the boom was approximately 40 feet from the ground.  The tip of the boom then would be a distance of approximately 8 to 10 feet above those high-voltage wires.  [Samet testified that the boom was about 18 inches above the wires.] . . . I had an unobstructed vision of the pipe and [Howard] and of the high-voltage wires, and I swung my boom within some 12 to 18 inches of those high-voltage wires and a distance of some 8 to 10 feet over and above the high-voltage wires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson further testified that it was necessary to boom at that height; that, when Couch said something to him about watching out for the wires, Howard and two or three others were standing behind Couch within hearing distance; and that he [Wilson] on several occasions had warned Howard &quot;about being careful of the wires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson further testified: &quot;Prior to the time that the accident occurred, [Howard] had not at any time pulled the finger over to any of the pipe.  That was the first time he had done that.  When he pulled the finger toward the pipe on the occasion when the accident occurred, it pulled the cable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to an angle out from under the boom and into the wires.  When he first started to pull the finger, the crane was moving, but as he started pulling, I stopped.  When I stopped, I was about 12 to 18 inches away from the wire.  There was no way to get that pipe out from under the wires where it was located without moving the crane over fairly close to the wires.  When I warned [Howard] about the wires, he acknowledged what I told him.  He would say 'Okay.' On another occasion, he looked toward the wires, or just nodded his head.  The reason I warned him more than once was that I just wanted to keep reminding him that the wires were up there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leslie Preston, a district engineer with Duke Power Company, visited the job site the day after the accident and made certain measurements with regard to the power lines.  He testified that the utility pole was about 18 inches from the curb of Kettering Road; that the height of the wire at the point of contact was 32 feet 8 inches; and that the point on the ground directly under the point of contact was &quot;about 5 1/2 feet&quot; from the curb of Kettering Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howard G. Bowen, Sr., who is vice president and general superintendent of Construction Company, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testified that, although he was not present when the crane was being operated, he had warned his son of the general dangers of construction and mentioned the wires to him but had not requested that the power be cut off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testimony relating to the issue of damages will be set forth in the opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rental Company and Wilson, the original defendants, brought Construction Company into this action as a third-party defendant for indemnification based on an agreement in the rental contract between Construction Company and Rental Company.  However, the trial court ordered severance and separate trials of the issues between plaintiff and defendants Rental Company and Wilson, and the issue of indemnification between defendants Rental Company and Wilson, as third-party plaintiffs, and Construction Company, as third-party defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The separate trial of the issues between plaintiff and defendants Rental Company and Wilson was before Judge Exum and a jury at 3 January 1972, Two-Week Regular Civil Session, of Guilford Superior Court (High Point).  It was stipulated that at the time of the accident defendant Wilson was acting as agent of defendant Rental Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues submitted, and the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jury's answers, are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1.  Was the death of plaintiff's intestate, Howard Gibson Bowen, Jr., proximately caused by the negligence of the defendants, James Stephen Wilson and Constructors Equipment Rental Company?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Answer: Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2.  If so, did the negligence of plaintiff's intestate, Howard Gibson Bowen, Jr., contribute to his death?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Answer: No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3.  What amount, if any, is the plaintiff entitled to recover?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Answer: $ 115,000.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4.  Was Samet Construction Company negligent on the occasion in question, and if so was such negligence a proximate cause of the death of plaintiff's intestate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Answer: Yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, Rental Company and Wilson, pursuant to Rule 50(b)(1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, G.S. 1A-1, moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the first, second and third issues, and in the alternative for a new trial for various &quot;errors which may have arisen.&quot; Their motions were denied and they excepted.  The court also denied their alternative motion for a new trial on the first and second issues.  However, the court allowed their motion to set aside the verdict on the third issue but solely on the ground that the court had committed error&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in its instructions to the jury in the specific respect discussed in the opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Construction Company, and its compensation carrier, moved that the court set aside the jury's answer to the fourth issue on the grounds that (1) there was no evidence to support the answer; and (2) there was &quot;probably some error in the Charge with respect to that Issue.&quot; This motion was denied and Construction Company and its compensation carrier excepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff excepted to the ruling of the court which set aside the jury's answer to the third issue and granted a new trial with reference thereto and appealed to the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants Rental Company and Wilson excepted to the ruling of the court which denied their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on issues one and two and appealed to the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On defendants' appeal the Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling which denied their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the first and second issues.  One member of the hearing panel having dissented, they appealed this decision to the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On plaintiff's appeal, the Court of Appeals (without dissent) affirmed the ruling of the court which set&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  aside the answer to the third issue and awarded a new trial with reference thereto on account of error in the charge.  Plaintiff's petition for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to review this portion of the decision was allowed by this Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal does not involve any of the issues in the conditional cross-action by defendants Rental Company and Wilson against Construction Company for indemnification.  Too, Construction Company and its compensation carrier have not brought forward their exception to the court's denial of their motion to set aside the jury's answer to the fourth issue.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant rental company sought review of the decision from the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which affirmed a judgment from the superior court finding that the rental company was liable for the death of plaintiff representative of decedent's estate. The rental company argued that the decedent was contributorily negligent in his accidental death. The representative alleged that the superior court erred in setting aside a verdict on damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent was killed when the cable of a rental crane he was holding came in contact with a high voltage wire. The court determined that the question of whether the decedent was contributorily negligent was not a question of law as the rental company argued, but a question of fact for the jury. The superior court properly denied the rental company's motions for a directed verdict or a new trial. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 28-173, the superior court was correct in holding that it had erred in instructing the jury that damages for wrongful death should have been based on the decedent's life expectancy. Where the decedent would most likely have outlived his parents, who were the heirs under the intestacy laws, the measure of damages should have been based on the parents' life expectancy. The court further held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 28-173 and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 28-174, as rewritten under the Act to Rewrite N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 28-174, N.C. Session Laws of 1969, Chapter 215, could be reconciled and implemented. The court concluded that subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (4) of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 28-174 were not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the superior court, which found a rental company liable for the death of the decedent. The court also affirmed the decision of the superior court to set aside the jury's verdict on damages and grant a new trial on the question of damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Godwin, S.J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 27 November 1972 Criminal Session of Wake Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 3 September 1972 the defendant, James Louis Mitchell, was indicted in separate bills of indictment, proper in form, for four offenses: (1) rape, (2) kidnapping, (3) common law robbery, and (4) crime against nature.  On 24 October 1972 trial was begun on these indictments before Judge Canaday and a jury in Wake Superior Court.  During the trial Judge Canaday, on motion of defendant, ordered a mistrial because of improper statements made by the solicitor in the presence of the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 6 November 1972 the defendant filed a motion for a change of venue for the reason that publicity during the first trial made a fair trial in Wake County impossible.  On 6 November 1972 Judge Brewer found as a fact that the defendant could receive a fair trial in Wake County and denied this motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried at the 27 November 1972 Criminal Session of Wake Superior Court for the four offenses charged in the 3 September 1972 bills of indictment.  The evidence for the State tends to show: On 13 July 1972 Mrs. Cynthia Y. Wortham was working as a nursing assistant at Wake Memorial Hospital.  At&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  11:20 p.m. Mrs. Wortham got off from work and started walking to her car parked near the hospital.  While going to her car, she noticed someone walking beside her but assumed he was another employee leaving work.  When she reached her car, the man who had been walking beside her ran up and grabbed her.  Mrs. Wortham identified this man as the defendant, James Mitchell.  Defendant then forced Mrs. Wortham to get into her car and lie down on the passenger side while he drove the car.  Coming out of the hospital parking lot, she attempted to grab the steering wheel.  The defendant struck her in the face, pulled her hair and told her that if she did not cooperate, he would kill her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant drove Mrs. Wortham's car into a dirt road adjacent to a construction site and parked the car.  Defendant then had intercourse with Mrs. Wortham by force and without her consent.  Upon completion of the first act of intercourse, defendant compelled her to engage in an act of sexual intercourse </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">per anum</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  After this act was concluded, defendant drove back to the hospital where he forced Mrs. Wortham to get into the trunk of the car.  Defendant left, got his own car and drove it to a point close&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to Mrs. Wortham's car.  He then let her out of the trunk and demanded that she give him any money that she had.  She gave him $ 7 and he left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Wortham immediately went to her parents' home and called the police.  She was taken to Wake Memorial Hospital and examined by Dr. D. L. Jones.  Her clothing was disheveled and soiled, she had a redness of her right cheek, three separate abrasions of her left elbow, a small cut on her lower lip, a bruise on her medial left breast, and a small cut at the opening of the female genitalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A latent fingerprint and a palm print taken from the inside of Mrs. Wortham's car matched defendant's finger and palm prints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered the testimony of his wife and mother-in-law who saw defendant on the night in question prior to the commission of the alleged crimes.  Their testimony tends to contradict Mrs. Wortham concerning the clothing worn by defendant on that night.  Defendant did not testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned verdicts of guilty of rape, kidnapping, common law robbery and crime against nature.  From judgments imposing prison sentences, defendant appealed.  Pursuant to G.S. 7A-31(a), we allowed defendant's motion to certify the common law&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  robbery and the crime against nature cases for review by this Court prior to determination by the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina), which imposed consecutive prison sentences upon the conviction for rape, kidnapping, common law robbery, and crime against nature. The trial court imposed life sentences on both the rape and the kidnapping charges and 10 year sentences on each of the other charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that his motion for a change of venue, based on publicity regarding a prior mistrial on the charges, was erroneously denied. The court held that there was nothing that showed that any juror had been influenced by the publicity, which was factual articles of what transpired at the first trial and mistrial. The prosecuting witness had viewed photographs prior to trial and identified defendant from the photos. There was no abuse of discretion giving the identified photo of defendant to the jury, and then giving the jury the remaining photos. An expert witness was properly allowed to testify regarding fingerprint comparisons because his study and experience qualified him as an expert. The parties had stipulated that a doctor had found the presence of sperm in the prosecuting witness' vagina. The trial court, in responding to questions from the jury, correctly explained that the stipulation negated the need for proof on the subject and that the presence of sperm in the vagina was not a required element of rape. The court held that the sentences imposed were within the statutory ranges for each offense and were not cruel and unusual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found no error in the trial, the verdicts, or the judgments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon a bill of indictment, proper in form, charging him with the murder of Lee Edward Ingram on 24 February 1972.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that defendant worked in Aberdeen on 24 February 1972 and returned to Rockingham about 5:30 p.m. Around 9 p.m. he left Potts' Pool Room on East Washington Street in Rockingham in company with James Malloy and Alfred Steele.  They drove to the Philadelphia section which is about five miles from East Washington Street.  There defendant redeemed a 12-gauge single-barreled shotgun which he and his uncle had previously pawned to Mrs. Maude Dennis.  Defendant and his companions then returned to East Washington Street.  Defendant alighted and his companions drove on about fifty feet to park the car.  &quot;About a minute after we let the defendant out of the car, I heard a shot.  At that time we were getting out of the truck.  . . . When I got out of the truck, I saw somebody laying in the street, but I did not know who it was.  He was about 50 or 60 feet away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cassie Belle Staton testified that she was in the vicinity of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  East Washington Street around 10 p.m. and had seen Lee Edward Ingram, the deceased, come out of the pool room about 9:30 p.m. and get in a car occupied by Mrs. Imogene McDonald.  He stayed in the car awhile and was getting out of it when defendant approached with a shotgun in his hand and said, &quot;I got you now.&quot; With gun in hand, defendant kept repeating, &quot;Say what you said before; say it now.&quot; Ingram replied, &quot;Man, what are you talking about?&quot; Defendant said, &quot;Come on now; why don't you say it now?&quot; Before Ingram said anything else defendant threw up the gun and shot him in the face.  Ingram died on the spot.  Defendant went into Potts' Pool Room, reloading the gun as he went.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policeman Jasper Christmas arrived on the scene within five minutes and found Ingram lying on the street five or six feet from Potts' Pool Hall.  He examined the body, found part of the head blown off, and determined that Lee Edward Ingram was dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified as a witness in his own behalf.  He said he was twenty-one years of age, married but not living with his wife.  He was casually acquainted with Lee Edward Ingram and knew he went by the name of &quot;Mule&quot; Ingram.  He first heard about Ingram in September&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1971.  At that time Ingram was with defendant's wife, and as she left to go with defendant Mule Ingram &quot;told me I had better not hit her.&quot; He saw Ingram again in December 1971 in company with one Herman Baldwin when Baldwin fired a gun toward defendant's house.  Defendant testified he had been informed by his brother that Mule Ingram, Herman Baldwin and Bo Didley were looking for him; that Mule was &quot;cursing and going on&quot; and had a gun; &quot;that Mule was the one that wanted to fight, and that Mule was pushing [putting] Herman up to fight me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified that he weighs 133 pounds and is 5 feet 9 inches tall, and that Mule Ingram weighed about twenty pounds more and was about two inches taller.  On 24 February 1972 defendant worked in Aberdeen, returned to Rockingham after getting off work, and went to Quick's Grill where he drank some beer and wine.  He then went to the pool room where he saw several people including Mule Ingram.  He heard Mule Ingram say, &quot;Damn -- that damn ass is here now.&quot; After hearing this, defendant left the pool room and got James Malloy to take him to get the shotgun, intending to talk to Ingram.  &quot;I figured that was the only way I could talk to him&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to keep him away from me, to leave me alone.&quot; Defendant further testified that he had given Ingram no reason to call him a damn ass.  He went to Maudie's Place and got a shotgun his uncle had pawned there and returned, figuring that &quot;if they seen me with the gun . . .  I would have a better chance to talk with him and tell him to leave me alone.&quot; When he got back to the East Washington Street area defendant got out of the truck and crossed the street to the sidewalk with the gun in his right hand, the barrel pointed downward.  He saw Ingram standing facing the McDonald car, walked toward him, stopped five or six feet from him, and called his name.  When Ingram turned to face him, defendant said, &quot;Mule, why do you and Herman want to fight me, man?&quot; Ingram threw his arms up and said, &quot;Man, I don't mean no harm -- we don't mean no harm,&quot; but was coming toward defendant while making that statement; &quot;and right after he said that he just made a jump, a lunge at me.&quot; When Ingram made the lunge he was about an arm's length away, and defendant &quot;throwed the gun up and it shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant said he did not recall pulling the trigger and meant only to scare Ingram to keep him off.  He testified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that he entered the pool room and a man named Rush told him he had better run, whereupon he threw the gun down and ran.  He said he never ejected the spent shell from the chamber and never reloaded the gun.  He stated that he believed Ingram had a knife at the time but that he did not intend to kill Ingram.  He denied saying to Ingram: &quot;Say again what you said before, say it now, man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous witnesses testified that they had known defendant all of his life and that his general reputation was good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albert McDonald, a rebuttal witness for the State, testified that he was in Potts' Pool Room about ten o'clock when he heard the shot; that defendant came in and asked for Herman Baldwin &quot;and said he was going to kill that son-of-a-bitch too&quot;; that somebody said &quot;Here comes the police,&quot; and defendant ran toward the back door, threw the shotgun in the bathroom, and ran out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Imogene McDonald testified that she talked with Lee Edward Ingram, the deceased, while her husband was in the pool room; that Ingram was sitting in her car, and when he opened the door to get out the defendant approached and said, &quot;Say it now what you said before&quot;; that Ingram then got out of the car and was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  turning around as he put his hand up and said, &quot;Hold it, man, hold it,&quot; and defendant shot him; that they were three to six feet apart; that defendant then went into the pool room; that Mule Ingram was her first cousin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's motion for judgment of nonsuit at the close of all the evidence was denied.  The jury convicted defendant of murder in the first degree and recommended mercy.  Defendant appeals from a sentence of death by asphyxiation, assigning errors discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Remanded for judgment.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Richmond Superior Court (North Carolina) denied defendant's motion for judgment of nonsuit, convicted defendant of first degree murder, and sentenced defendant to death by asphyxiation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot and killed the victim outside a pool room. Defendant argued that the jury was erroneously not informed that his conviction of first degree murder resulted in a mandatory death sentence. The court rejected defendant's argument because the jury did not have authority to reduce the penalty imposed on defendant and the amount of punishment which a guilty verdict empowered the trial court to impose was irrelevant to the issue of defendant's guilt. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing leading questions. Defendant was not improperly denied a jury instruction on self-defense because the evidence was insufficient to invoke the doctrine of self-defense; the evidence did not prove that defendant had a legal basis for using deadly force under the guise of self-defense. Defendant's conviction was thus proper. However, defendant's death sentence had to be vacated. The mandatory death sentence for first degree murder pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17 was inapplicable to any offense, such as defendant's, that was committed before January 18, 1973.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The orders denying defendant's motion for nonsuit and convicting him of first degree murder were affirmed. The order imposing a death sentence on defendant was vacated and the case was remanded so that a life sentence could be imposed on him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon the original warrant, sufficient in form, charging him with operating a motor vehicle on a public street or highway on 22 November 1971 while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that Mrs. Coanne Gillespie, after giving a right turn signal, prepared to turn her 1968 Buick from Armstrong Park Drive and enter Club Drive to her right.  Her Buick was struck from behind by a Chevrolet driven by defendant Jerry Dean Eubanks.  Defendant got out of his vehicle and said it was his fault.  While he and Mrs. Gillespie were waiting for the arrival of the police, Mrs. Gillespie noticed &quot;a strong smell of alcohol about Mr. Eubanks,&quot; and two of her passengers commented on it.  Defendant said the sun had been in his eyes prior to the collision; but Mrs. Gillespie, who was traveling in the same direction, testified that she &quot;did not have a bit of trouble with the sun.&quot; Other evidence indicated that at 3:30 p.m., the approximate time of the collision, the sun was to the west and on the left of drivers proceeding in the direction defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Mrs. Gillespie were driving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Officer J. R. Deaton arrived at the scene he observed defendant &quot;bent over looking into his car.&quot; In response to the officer's inquiry defendant said he was driving the Chevrolet.  While producing his driver's license for the officer's inspection, defendant &quot;was very hesitant and stumbled through his pocket book, and finally got his license out, and after he got his license, I noticed he had to lean against the car to keep steady.  He was very unsteady on his feet, and at all times, he was leaning next to his vehicle to keep straight, and I noticed a strong odor of alcohol on his breath.  I placed him under arrest for D.U.I., and after I had talked to him and made sure he was the driver, and he was, in my opinion -- he was under the influence of some alcoholic beverage.&quot; Defendant was placed under arrest there at the scene and taken to the police station.  A warrant was thereafter obtained and served upon him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the police station Officer J. R. Carter advised defendant of his rights concerning the breathalyzer.  Officer Carter told him that &quot;he had the choice of either taking the test or refusing the test; that if he refused the test, none would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be given . . . that his license could be suspended for sixty days if he refused . . . that he had a right to call an attorney and have him present during the test, or he had a right to call any other witness for the test that he wanted.&quot; Twenty minutes later the officer asked defendant if he would submit to the breathalyzer test.  &quot;He said he would take the test,&quot; and it was accordingly administered by Officer Carter who recorded the reading of .27 on a breathalyzer operation check list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified that he got off work at 2 p.m. on 22 November 1971.  He bought two six-packs of beer, drank one beer on the way to the home of his friend, Miles Oscar Huffstickler where he ate dinner and drank another beer.  He then left for his own home.  &quot;I started up this slight incline and the sun was right in my face, and I reached up to pull the sun visor down, and as I did, I looked back down, and this lady was sort of sitting in the road and I hit my brakes and I hit her.&quot; According to defendant, at the time of the collision there were ten full cans of beer in his car.  He testified that he was not under the influence of intoxicants when the collision occurred.  However, he said he &quot;was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  still shook up the next day, and didn't feel good, and had a headache.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miles Oscar Huffstickler corroborated defendant's testimony with respect to the two beers consumed by defendant while in Huffstickler's presence on the afternoon of 22 November 1971.  This witness stated that he last saw defendant at approximately 3 p.m. and the witness had no knowledge as to the amount of intoxicants, if any, defendant drank after he left and before the collision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found defendant guilty as charged and from judgment imposing a suspended sentence upon the conditions therein named, defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals.  The case was duly docketed there and certified to the Supreme Court for initial appellate review pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 7A-31(b)(4).  Errors assigned will be noted in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed to the court of appeals and the case was certified to the court for initial appellate review. He challenged the judgment from Gaston Superior Court (North Carolina) which found him guilty of operating a motor vehicle upon a public highway under the influence of intoxicants. Defendant was arrested on a warrant and before pleading he sought to have suppressed, the results of the breathalyzer test and the officer's observations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At trial defendant contended that the results of the breathalyzer test and the officer's observations of the defendant at the scene were rendered inadmissible by the illegality of defendant's arrest without a warrant. The trial court denied the motion and the denial was assigned as error on appeal. The court upheld the trial court's judgment, noting that the evidence did not have to be excluded. The court held that an unlawful arrest could not be equated to an unlawful search and seizure and nothing in North Carolina law required the exclusion of evidence obtained following an arrest, which was constitutionally valid but illegal for failure to first obtain an arrest warrant. Defendant further argued that his consent to take the breathalyzer test was not voluntary but coerced, thus the test results were inadmissible. Defendant urged that the results of the breathalyzer were inadmissible because the state failed to prove that the test was performed according to methods approved by the State Board of Health as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-139.1(b). The court held that there was no coercive misstatement made in the case and the test was performed according to the approved methods.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court upheld the trial court's judgment, which convicted defendant of operating a motor vehicle upon a public highway under the influence of intoxicants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal both by plaintiffs and by defendants from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McKinnon, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 11 September 1972 non-jury Session of Robeson, heard prior to determination by the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two actions for injunctive relief and for damages were, by consent, consolidated for trial in the Superior Court, the material facts being the same in both.  By consent, the action in each case against the defendant McBryde was dismissed.  The defendant Lafayette Transportation Service, Inc., was not a party to the suit by Porter.  The judgment of the Superior Court in the suit by Sanitation Service, Inc., granted no injunctive relief against this defendant and the question of its liability for damages was reserved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Superior Court granted injunctive relief in favor of each plaintiff against Suburban Sanitation Service, Inc., hereinafter called Suburban, and in favor of Sanitation Service, Inc., against Logan.  It also adjudged that both plaintiffs recover damages of Suburban and that Sanitation Service, Inc., recover damages of Logan, all such damages to be assessed after further hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each action the plaintiff alleged that on 6 December 1971 Robeson County, pursuant to authority conferred&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon it by G.S. 153-272, granted to the plaintiff an exclusive franchise, for a period of five years, &quot;to pick up, collect, transport and dispose of trash, garbage and refuse&quot; in a designated area of the county, the two such franchises, together, covering the entire county outside of the incorporated cities and towns therein.  Each plaintiff alleged that the defendants sued by him or it are engaged in the business of picking up, collecting, transporting and disposing of garbage and refuse for a fee within the area described in such plaintiff's franchise and prays that such defendants be permanently enjoined from so doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each such franchise agreement also purported to grant an exclusive right &quot;to operate and maintain landfills and dispose of trash and garbage&quot; in the described area.  In each the grantee agreed to &quot;render reasonably acceptable service to persons, firms and corporations located in [the] franchised area and at a reasonable price for services rendered,&quot; the price not to be less than that prevailing for like services in adjoining North Carolina counties.  Each franchise agreement further provided that nothing therein &quot;shall prevent any person, firm or corporation from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  personally disposing of its own trash, garbage or refuse * * * in a legal and lawful manner,&quot; that the grantee's landfill &quot;shall be open to the general public&quot; upon payment of a reasonable fee and that the grantee agreed to commence service on 1 January 1972 and to serve the entire area within twelve months thereafter.  The two franchises are identical except as to territory and except that the one issued to Sanitation Service, Inc., is for the collection and disposal of &quot;trash and garbage,&quot; whereas that issued to Porter is for the collection and disposal of &quot;trash, garbage and refuse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their answers Suburban and Logan each admits that it or he &quot;has been engaged in the said business of picking up, collecting and transporting, not only garbage and refuse, but also rubbish, trash and other discarded solid materials under the rules and regulations of the North Carolina State Board of Health as they pertain to the disposal of solid waste.&quot; Each alleged that the exclusive franchise relied upon by the plaintiff is illegal and void, being both in excess of the authority conferred upon the county by statute and a deprivation of the defendant's contractual and property rights, in violation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury trial being waived, the matters were heard by the Superior Court.  It was stipulated that Suburban, as of the date of the hearing, continued to pick up and dispose of garbage, refuse and trash within the area described in each of the franchise agreements, serving one business customer and 39 residents of the area covered by the Porter franchise and four business customers and 206 residents of the area covered by the franchise issued to Sanitation Service, Inc., and that Logan, likewise, continued to pick up and dispose of garbage, refuse and trash within the area covered by the franchise agreement issued to Sanitation Service, Inc., serving five business customers and 250 residents of that area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was further stipulated that Suburban applied to the County Tax Collector for a license, tendering the proper fee therefor, but was refused such license because of the existence of the above mentioned franchises; that both Suburban and Logan sought from the County Commissioners an approval letter, required by the State Board of Health before it will inspect a solid waste disposal facility, which approval letter was refused because&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the existence of the said franchises; and that each of these defendants has permission to dispose of its collections of waste materials in the landfill operated by the City of Fayetteville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the purpose of its judgment, the Superior Court adopted, as applicable to these actions, the definitions of &quot;garbage,&quot; &quot;refuse&quot; and &quot;solid waste&quot; contained in G.S. 130-166.16(1), (2) and (3), respectively.  The plaintiffs assign this as error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Superior Court's findings of fact material to this appeal are here summarized, except as direct quotation is indicated:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">On 6 December 1971 the County Board of Commissioners adopted resolutions set forth in its minutes and thereafter entered into the above mentioned franchise agreement with Sanitation Service, Inc., granting it &quot;an exclusive franchise and right to pick up, collect, transport and dispose of trash and garbage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Porter is and has been engaged in the business of solid waste disposal.  Prior to 21 April 1971, he was granted an exclusive privilege &quot;to collect waste&quot; in the area covered by the franchise agreement here in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;4. Pursuant to the actions of the Board of Commissioners on December 6, 1971, the County of Robeson&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  entered into an Exclusive Franchise and Agreement dated December 6, 1971, with James Porter granting to him an 'Exclusive Franchise and Right to pick up, collect, transport and dispose of trash, garbage and refuse outside of the incorporated cities and towns of Robeson County' in a specifically described area which was the same territory for which he had previously been granted an exclusive privilege to collect waste.  [To this finding the defendants excepted.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;5. Suburban Sanitation Service, Inc., is a North Carolina corporation incorporated in April 1971, and Wayne L. Raybon is its president and sole stockholder.  Wayne L. Raybon has been engaged in the business of solid waste disposal since 1967, and has continued the same business through Suburban Sanitation Service, Inc., since its incorporation.  Suburban Sanitation Service, Inc., as of the date of the hearing was serving approximately 206 residences and 4 businesses in the territory described in the exclusive franchise and agreement to Sanitation Service, Inc., and approximately 39 residences and one business in the territory described in the exclusive franchise and agreement to James Porter.  Suburban Sanitation Service, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  Inc., holds a permit from the Robeson County Health Director and maintains a truck approved by the Robeson County Health Director for the operation of its business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;6. Cooper Logan is a citizen and resident of Robeson County, doing business as Logan's Disposal Service, and has been for more than two years prior to the date of the hearing engaged in the business of solid waste disposal, and at the date of the hearing was serving approximately 250 residences and 5 businesses in the territory described in the 'Exclusive Franchise and Agreement' to Sanitation Service, Inc.  He holds a permit from the Robeson County Health Director and maintains a truck approved by the Robeson County Health Director.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Wayne L. Raybon and the defendant Logan had notice of and participated in a meeting of the County Board of Commissioners on 21 April 1971 at which a public hearing was held on the question of providing garbage and trash service in the county on a franchise basis.  Each of them also had notice of the continuing deliberations of the Board of Commissioners on the subject, and Wayne Raybon attended the meeting of the Board on 6 December 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;10. The defendant, Suburban Sanitation Service, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  Inc., and the defendant, Cooper Logan, are engaged in essentially the same type of operation, each serving primarily residences outside of the municipalities in Robeson County and picking up on a regular schedule all household solid waste that may be put out for collection by their customers.  Such solid wastes include, among other things, paper, bottles, cans, tree limbs, food scraps, rotten fruit, and food wrappers, and are the types of solid wastes normally found at residences.  Each defendant estimates that the vegetable and animal food scraps and matter approximates 10% or less of the material collected.  Such putrescible material is inseparable from the other solid waste put out for collection, and it is collected and disposed of by these defendants by transportation in their respective trucks to the landfill of the City of Fayetteville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;11. That because of its inseparable nature and because it contains putrescible material, including animal and vegetable food scraps, containers and wrappers which have contained food and other putrescible material and which have not been cleaned, and milk cartons and soft drink cans, the solid waste collected by these defendants constitutes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  'garbage' as defined in this Judgment and within the meaning of G.S. 153-272.  [To this finding the defendants excepted.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;12. Suburban Sanitation Service, Inc., is engaging in the business of picking up, collecting, transporting and disposing of garbage within the territory described in the Exclusive Franchise and Agreement of Sanitation Service, Inc., and within the territory described in the Exclusive Franchise and Agreement to James Porter, and its continued operation results in damage to each of the plaintiffs.  [To this finding the defendants excepted.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;13. Cooper Logan, doing business as Logan's Disposal Service, is engaging in the business of picking up, collecting, transporting and disposing of garbage within the territory described in the Exclusive Franchise and Agreement to Sanitation Service, Inc., and his continued operation results in damage to Sanitation Service, Inc. There has been no evidence that Logan has engaged in this business in this territory franchised to James Porter, and he was not sued by Porter.  [To this finding the defendants excepted.]&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the foregoing stipulations and findings of fact, the Superior Court reached the following conclusions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of law:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Conclusions of Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;1. That G.S. 153-272 is a valid enactment of authority to County Commissioners to regulate the collection and disposal of garbage, and that the statute is not unconstitutional on any ground alleged by the defendants.  [To this conclusion the defendants excepted.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;2. The Court is of the opinion that G.S. 153-272 validly authorizes the Robeson County Board of Commissioners to regulate the collection of and disposal of garbage in the interest of public health, and that the inclusion of garbage or putrescible material in waste collected and disposed of creates a valid danger to the public health which is a proper subject of regulation.  [To this conclusion the defendants excepted.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;3. That the actions of the Robeson County Board of Commissioners in granting exclusive franchises for the collection and disposal of garbage, after notice and hearing as described in the minutes of the Board of Commissioners, was a valid exercise by the Robeson County Board of Commissioners of the authority granted to it by statute.  [To this conclusion the defendants excepted.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;4. The Court is of the opinion that insofar as the resolutions of the Robeson County&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  Board of Commissioners and the exclusive franchises and agreements to Sanitation Service, Inc., and to James Porter, purport to grant an exclusive franchise and right to pick up, collect, transport and dispose of trash, the Court finds the term 'trash' to be synonymous with 'refuse' or nonputrescible wastes, and the court finds this to be beyond the authority granted by G.S. 153-272 and ultra vires, and the court is of the opinion that the purported inclusion of the term 'trash' is surplusage insofar as the grant of an exclusive franchise is concerned and does not invalidate the valid grant of such franchises as to garbage.  [To this conclusion both plaintiffs and defendants excepted.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;5. The Court is of the opinion that insofar as the exclusive franchise and agreements might be interpreted as an exclusive franchise to maintain landfills that this is beyond the authority granted by G.S. 153-272 and beyond the authority of the resolutions adopted by the Board of Commissioners of Robeson County on December 6, 1971, but this does not invalidate the valid portions of the exclusive franchises and agreements.  [To this conclusion both plaintiffs and defendants excepted.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;6. The Court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  is of the opinion that the enactment of Article 13B of Chapter 130 of the General Statutes in 1969 did not affect the authority of the Board of Commissioners to act under G.S. 153-272, but that the operations of persons engaged in the business of solid waste disposal are subject to the valid regulations made pursuant to that article.  [To this conclusion the defendants excepted.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;7. That the operations of the defendants, Suburban Sanitation Service, Inc., and Cooper Logan, doing business as Logan Disposal Service, in the collection of solid waste material which includes garbage, is in violation of the Exclusive Franchises and Agreements as validly granted to the plaintiffs by the Robeson County Board of Commissioners and is causing the respective plaintiffs irreparable harm for which no adequate remedy at law exists, and the respective plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief.  [To this conclusion the defendants excepted.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;8. For the purposes of interpreting this Judgment and the injunctive relief herein granted, the Court is of the opinion that the collection and disposal of residential, commercial and industrial solid wastes which do not include garbage, or putrescible&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  material, is not in violation of the Exclusive Franchises and Agreements validly granted to the respective plaintiffs.  [To this conclusion both plaintiffs and defendants excepted.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;9. The defendants have offered no evidence of the unreasonableness of fees charged by Sanitation Service, Inc., or James Porter, and the Court is of the opinion that the defendants have no standing to complain about the portions of the Exclusive Franchises and Agreements which state that under no circumstances shall the prices charged be less than the prevailing prices for like services rendered in adjoining counties in the state, and the Court makes no determination as to the validity of that provision of the franchises and agreements.  [To this conclusion the defendants excepted.]&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court thereupon adjudged that Suburban be enjoined from &quot;picking up, collecting, transporting and disposing of solid waste material which includes garbage&quot; within the area covered by the franchise of Sanitation Service, Inc., and within the area covered by the franchise of Porter so long as those franchise agreements remain in force and effect, and that the defendant Logan be enjoined from &quot;picking up, collecting, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  transporting and disposing of solid waste material which includes garbage&quot; in the area covered by the franchise of Sanitation Service, Inc., so long as it remains in force and effect, and that Sanitation Service, Inc., recover damages of each defendant and Porter recover damages of Suburban, all such damages to be assessed after further hearing by the court upon motion of any party concerned.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a criminal prosecution upon a bill of indictment charging defendant with the rape of Deborah Ann Price on 25 September 1972.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before pleading defendant moved to quash the bill of indictment on the ground that G.S. 14-21 is unconstitutional.  The trial judge denied defendant's motion to quash, and defendant entered a plea of not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered evidence which tended to show that on 25 September 1972 Deborah Ann Price, a 19-year-old student at East Carolina University, left a class at about 10:40 a.m. and started to her dormitory along a railroad track.  She was overtaken by a young colored male who knocked her down, beat her and dragged her into a wooded area where he forcibly and against her will had intercourse with her.  Her assailant told her that he belonged to a black organization and would have her killed if she said anything.  He then walked away, and Miss Price went to a nearby house where she received aid.  She was carried to the University Infirmary and was then transferred to Pitt Memorial Hospital where she was examined by Dr. G. H. Satterfield, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Price unequivocally identified defendant as her assailant from photographs, at a lineup and in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Satterfield testified that when he examined Miss Price on 25 September 1972 she had a severe black eye and scratches and abrasions on her cheek, elbows, abdomen, legs and just below her collarbone.  He found evidence of acid phosphatase in the vaginal area.  He described acid phosphatase as an enzyme from the prostate gland of a male person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State also offered evidence that defendant was enrolled as a student at Rose High School in Greenville, and that he was absent from a second period history class which met from 10:15 to 11:00 a.m. on 25 September 1972.  He was also absent from the third, fourth, fifth and sixth periods on the same date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered evidence in the nature of an alibi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty of rape with recommendation of life imprisonment.  Defendant appealed from judgment imposing a sentence of life imprisonment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was overtaken while she was walking to her dormitory after a class. From photographs and in court, the victim unequivocally identified defendant as her assailant. The evidence showed that defendant was absent from his school during the time of and following the rape. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to life in prison under &sect; 14-21. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant argued that &sect; 14-21 was unconstitutional; therefore, the trial court should have granted his motion to quash the bill of indictment. Defendant specifically objected to the fact that he could have been sentenced to death under &sect; 14-21. The court held that because defendant did not receive a death sentence, he had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty or of &sect; 14-21 because it provided for that punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Bailey, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in Chambers of the Superior Court of Wake on 8 December 1972, heard prior to determination by the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pending the appeal, David T. Flaherty and William L. Bondurant were, by consent, substituted as parties defendant for Dr. Lenox D. Baker and W. L. Turner, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff, as taxpayer, on behalf of himself and other taxpayers of North Carolina, instituted this action to enjoin the defendants against taking contemplated steps to implement and carry out the North Carolina Medical Care Commission Hospital Facilities Finance Act, hereinafter called the Act, enacted in 1971 and found in G.S. 131-138 to G.S. 131-162.  The complaint alleges:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act violates the Constitution of North Carolina and the Constitution of the United States in that: (a) It authorizes the use of public funds for other than a public purpose, in violation of Article V, &sect; 2(1), of the Constitution of North Carolina and of the due process clauses contained in Article I, &sect; 19, of the Constitution of North Carolina and in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; (b) it authorizes the giving or lending of the credit of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State, through an agency of the State, to aid persons, associations or corporations without a vote of the people, in violation of Article V, &sect; 3(2), of the Constitution of North Carolina; (c) it unlawfully delegates legislative authority to the Medical Care Commission, in violation of Article I, &sect; 6, and Article II, &sect; 1, of the Constitution of North Carolina; (d) it authorizes the issuance of bonds, constituting an indebtedness of the State, in violation of Article V, &sect; 3, of the Constitution of North Carolina; (e) it authorizes the creation of a debt of a county, city, town or other unit of local government, without submission to the voters thereof, in violation of Article V, &sect;&sect; 2(5) and 4, of the Constitution of North Carolina; (f) it exempts from taxation property owned by the Commission, in violation of Article V, &sect; 2(3), of the Constitution of North Carolina; and (g) it authorizes financing of hospital facilities for lease to a church related institution, in violation of Article I, &sect; 13, of the Constitution of North Carolina and of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter was heard in the Superior Court upon an agreed statement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of facts, a jury trial being waived.  The court concluded that the Act of the General Assembly does not violate either the State or the Federal Constitution in any of the respects alleged in the complaint.  The court thereupon adjudged that the Commission is lawfully authorized and empowered to do all of the things set forth in the said Act of the General Assembly, in the manner in which it proposes to do them, and to perform all of the acts and functions which it has performed or proposes to perform, as set forth in such agreed statement of facts.  The court further adjudged that the relief sought by the plaintiff be denied, that the plaintiff be nonsuited and the action be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following is a summary of the stipulated facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff is a taxpayer of the State, Wake County and the City of Raleigh.  The Commission is an agency of the State.  The Act undertakes to vest in the Commission authority to effectuate a plan to issue revenue bonds to finance construction of public and private hospital facilities.  Fifteen thousand dollars of public funds, derived from State tax collections, has been allotted by the Council of State from the Contingency and Emergency Appropriation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for the use of the Commission in the implementation of this program.  The Commission proposes to spend these funds in its administration of the Act.  It also proposes to use the proceeds of such revenue bonds to finance and construct hospital facilities on land conveyed to the Commission.  Upon construction, each such facility will be leased by the Commission to a public agency or to a nonprofit organization, which may or may not be church related, for its operation for a term extending to the date on which all bonds and other obligations of the Commission are paid.  When the bonds are paid, the Commission will convey title to such facility to the lessee.  The Commission proposes to enter into such leases with counties, cities, towns and other units of local government, without submitting the same to the approval of the voters therein.  Under the terms of such leases the revenues generated by the leased facility will be applied to the payment of the revenue bonds, prior to the payment of the operating and maintenance costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study made by the Commission of hospital needs indicates that approximately 3,200 new general hospital beds and beds for extended care will be required in North&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Carolina by 1977 and that there are now 4,883 hospital beds in the State in varying degrees of obsolescence.  To meet this need for new beds and for modernization will require approximately $ 300,000,000.  Funds available from private donors now cover only a minor portion of such capital costs.  Approximately 50 per cent of the general hospitals in North Carolina are owned by local governments, which have the option of obtaining capital funds through the issuance of general obligation bonds, but the increasing demand on local governments for schools and other services has been so great that there is substantial resistance to bond issues for hospital construction.  Funds available from Federal grants under the Hill-Burton program are now substantially less than in former years.  The Federal loan program for supplying capital for hospital construction is subject to conditions making such loans unattractive to hospitals.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, taxpayer, challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Wake County (North Carolina), which adjudged that defendant, commission, was lawfully authorized and empowered to act under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 131-138 to &sect;&sect; 131-162, and to perform all of the acts and functions which it had performed or proposed to perform. The relief sought by taxpayer was denied and the action was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer instituted an action to enjoin the commission against taking contemplated steps to implement and carry out the North Carolina Medical Care Commission Hospital Facilities Finance Act of 1971, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 131-138 to &sect;&sect; 131-162. It was alleged that the Act violated the Constitution of North Carolina and the Constitution of the United States on multiple grounds. The trial court dismissed the case, finding the commission had authority to act. The taxpayer appealed. The court found the Act was a delegation of legislative power such as would require the conclusion that the Act, in its entirety, was unconstitutional. The court held: that the Act did not authorize the contracting of such a debt by the commission; that such a lease agreement constituted a debt of such governmental unit within the meaning of Article V, &sect; 4, of the Constitution of North Carolina; and that by authorizing counties, cities, towns and other units of local government to contract such a debt beyond the amount specified in the Constitution, without submitting the subject to a vote of the people, the General Assembly exceeded its constitutional authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded the judgment of the trial court, restraining and enjoining the commission from expending the funds allocated to it by the Act, and from expending the funds for such purpose of any other public funds raised by taxation, and further enjoining the commission from entering into any lease agreement with any public agency, as defined in the Act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecution for the violation of a Sunday Closing Ordinance.  Defendants were convicted by the District Court and appealed to the Superior Court, which allowed their motion to quash the warrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants are employees of Thrifty Supermarkets, Inc., which operates in the City of Monroe a supermarket and a number of &quot;convenience stores&quot; denominated Thrif-T-Marts (Marts).  Defendant Underwood operated the Mart on Lancaster Avenue; defendant Harkey operated another at Five Points.  Separate warrants charge that each defendant did unlawfully expose for sale and did sell at the Mart which he operated &quot;various items of groceries after 6:00 p.m. Sunday, April 9th, 1972,&quot; a violation of Monroe City Ordinance 15-36.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The declared purpose of Ordinance 15-36 is &quot;to provide for the due observance of Sunday as a day of rest, to protect and promote the general welfare, safety, and morals of the citizens&quot; by restricting business activities&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on Sunday in the City of Monroe.

The City Council hereby declares that it would have passed this ordinance and each section, subsection, clause, and phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one (1) or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases be declared invalid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ordinance became effective on 8 October 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When defendants' cases were called for trial each moved to quash the warrant against him on the ground that Ordinance 15-36 is unconstitutional in that it arbitrarily discriminates between persons and classes, and that it bears no reasonable relation to &quot;The City Council's legitimate objective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In support of the motion to quash, Judge Collier heard evidence offered by defendants and found facts substantially as detailed below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For approximately two years Thrifty Supermarkets, Inc., has operated seven &quot;convenience stores&quot; in Monroe.  Each store has four gasoline pumps, two for regular gasoline and two for high test.  Gasoline, motor oil, and auto products are among the principal items sold.  The stores also carry health and beauty aids, tobacco products, popcorn, bag ice, soft drinks, candy, cakes, wrapped sandwiches, general&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grocery products, magazines and newspapers, children's books, coloring books, beer, wine, bread, dairy products, and ice cream.  The stores do not have a produce market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the opening of the Marts no store in Monroe offered the same combination of goods.  The convenience stores are &quot;a relatively new concept in merchandising.&quot; The Marts buy the same licenses as do service stations, newsstands, and tobacco stores on the same products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local newsstands and cigar stores, which are permitted to remain open all day Sunday, sell tobacco products, popcorn, newspapers, periodicals, sandwiches, doughnuts, bread, milk, ice cream, potato chips, and records as their principal items.  The Marts do not sell as full a line of merchandise as a supermarket.  However, they sell substantially the same items as filling stations, tobacco stores, and newsstands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the month of April 1972, including the period said stores were open seven days a week, gasoline sales amounted to 16.8% of total sales.  Of the Marts' total Sunday sales during April 1972, 23.4% were of gasoline.  Except on the day of the arrests the stores were open only from 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. each Sunday.  Estimated sales&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of tobacco and tobacco products, papers and periodicals, ice, soft drinks, ice cream, candy and cakes, motor oils and related products, doughnuts and wrapped sandwiches, milk, butter, and frozen dairy products, during a seven-day week amounted to 20-25% of gross sales.  During Sunday hours the sale of these items, together with the sale of gasoline, amounted to 80-85% of gross sales.  The percentage of sales of those items is higher on Sunday because the sale of beer and wine is prohibited on that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the foregoing findings of fact Judge Collier concluded that the ordinance violates the equal protection clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions and has no reasonable relationship to the accomplishment of the declared purpose of the ordinance.  Whereupon he adjudicated the ordinance unconstitutional and allowed defendants' motion to quash the warrants.  The State appealed.  </SPAN></P>

The intermediate court of appeals held that the Ordinance violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions and had no reasonable relationship to the accomplishment of its declared purpose. The court held that: (1) the intermediate court of appeals erred in considering extraneous evidence in entertaining defendants' motion to quash the warrants; (2) since the purported defect in the warrants had to be established by evidence aliunde the record, the motion should have been denied; (3) since the grounds of defendants' challenge did not appear upon the face of the record, a jury should have determined the constitutionality of the Ordinance by a special verdict; and (4) the Ordinance had a reasonable relationship to the public welfare, was a proper exercise of the police power, and did not discriminate within a class between competitors similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants from the Court of Appeals, which found no error in the judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Godwin, S.J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 17 July 1972 Criminal Session of Cumberland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants were tried and found guilty in the District Court of Cumberland County upon warrants charging them, respectively, with selling on Sunday articles of clothing in violation of an ordinance of Cumberland County entitled, &quot;An Ordinance Concerning the Observance of Sunday as a Uniform Day of Rest in Cumberland County.&quot; Upon appeal to the Superior Court, the cases were heard de novo, the three warrants being consolidated for trial without objection by the defendants.  Prior to the entry of a plea, each defendant moved to quash the warrant on the ground that the ordinance is unconstitutional in that it denies the defendant the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and of Article I, &sect; 19, of the Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the hearing of the motions to quash, the defendants, in support of their motions, introduced the testimony of a member of the Cumberland County Sheriff's staff to the effect that during the year 1972 moving picture&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  theaters, cigar and tobacco stores, newsstands, drug stores, grocery stores, fruit, vegetable and melon stands, manufacturing and industrial operations, and places of business of realtors and dealers in mobile homes operated on Sunday in Cumberland County in compliance with the ordinance.  The record does not make clear whether these were or were not within the limits of an incorporated municipality, within which the ordinance, by its terms, has no application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing upon the motions to quash, the defendant Atlas also testified that he purchased on Sunday, 16 July 1972, certain periodicals at a theater and bookstand located </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">in Fayetteville</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  The magazines so purchased were then offered by the defendants in evidence.  The objection of the State thereto was sustained.  Thereupon, the motions to quash were denied.  Each defendant then entered a plea of not guilty.  In each case the jury found the defendant guilty as charged and the Superior Court sentenced the defendant to imprisonment in the county jail for two days, the sentence to be suspended upon payment of a fine of $ 25.00 and the costs of the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, assigning as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  error: (1) The refusal of the Superior Court to admit the above mentioned magazines in evidence at the hearing of the motion to quash; (2) the denial of the motion to quash; and (3) the entry of the judgment above mentioned.  The Court of Appeals found no error, Campbell, J., dissenting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three warrants, except for the names of the defendants, the descriptions of the articles sold, and other matters not material to this appeal, were identical.  The warrant against the defendant Atlas was issued upon a duly sworn complaint charging as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;The undersigned, John DeCarter, upon information and belief, being duly sworn, complains and says that at and in the County named above and on or about the 5th day of March, 1972, the defendant named above did unlawfully, wilfully, while employed as the manager for Whitney Stores Incorporated, a corporation, doing business as Treasure City, Raeford Road, Fayetteville, North Carolina, said business premises being located in the County of Cumberland and outside the corporate limits and jurisdiction of any municipality, and at the said premises described above did sell clothing, wearing apparel and clothing accessories, to wit: one (1) pair&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  of men's cotton socks and one (1) man's snap-on necktie at 1:15 p.m., March 5, 1972, which is Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;The offense charged here was committed against the peace and dignity of the State and in violation of law G.S. 153-9(55) and Sec. 1A(1) Ordinance on the Observation of Sunday as a Uniform Day of Rest in Cumberland County, N. C.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant Ridge is similarly charged with selling one man's shirt and the defendant Huard is similarly charged with selling one pair of men's cotton socks and one man's snap-on necktie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was stipulated (1) that the business premises at which the sales are alleged to have occurred were located outside the corporate limits and jurisdiction of any municipality, and (2) that at the time of the alleged sales the ordinance in question had been duly enacted and was in full force and effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provisions of the ordinance are also stipulated.  The preamble recites that the power to enact ordinances requiring the observance of Sunday as a day of rest has been delegated to the county by G.S. 153-9(55), that the Board of Commissioners finds and declares that the carrying on of unrestricted business activities on Sunday in the county does not result in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  due observance of Sunday as a day of rest and is contrary to the public health, general welfare, safety and morals of the citizens, and that the board finds and declares that there exists a clear and present need to restrict the carrying on of business activities on Sunday in the county in order to provide for the due observance of Sunday as a day of rest, and to protect and promote the public health, the general welfare, safety and morals of the citizens.  The ordinance then provides:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;It shall be unlawful for any person to sell * * * any goods, wares or merchandise in the County of Cumberland on Sunday, nor shall any store * * * or any other place of business in which goods, wares, or merchandise are kept for sale, be kept open between 12:00 o'clock midnight Saturday and 12:00 o'clock midnight Sunday, unless such store * * * or other place of business is expressly allowed to open and sell goods under the provision of this article; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no such store * * * or other place of business shall sell, offer or expose for sale to the general public any of the following:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c19"><SPAN CLASS="c14">(1) Clothing and wearing apparel;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c20"><SPAN CLASS="c14">(7) Sporting goods and toys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ordinance then provides that certain specified types of business establishments may remain open on Sunday for the sale of specified types of merchandise; certain types of business establishments may remain open on Sunday during specified hours for the sale of articles other than those specifically prohibited by the above quoted provision of the ordinance and others may remain open for the rendition of specified services.  The establishments so permitted to remain open for business on Sundays are shoeshine parlors, sellers of Christmas greenery (during December), cigar and tobacco stores and newsstands (for the sale of specified types of merchandise), drug stores (except for the sale of articles of types enumerated in the above quoted provision of the ordinance), theaters and places of exhibition of games, plays and sports (including the sale thereat of beverages and confections), fruit, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vegetable and melon stands (from noon to midnight), garages and filling stations (including the sale of gasoline and oils, parts and accessories, beverages, confections and tobacco), grocery stores and curb markets (from noon to midnight for the sale of any items not otherwise prohibited by law), hotels, restaurants, etc., (for their usual business, including the sale of food, beverages, tobacco, newspapers and periodicals), ice, coal and fuel oil manufacturers and dealers (for the sale of these products), ice cream manufacturers, dairies and creameries (for the sale of these products), newspapers and magazines (including sales by newsstands or newsboys), sellers of live bait, manufacturers of bakery products (for the manufacture, sale and distribution of such products for consumption off the premises), hospitals, etc., establishments and offices rendering personal services, emergency repair services (including the sale of parts incident thereto), public utility services, athletic courts, swimming pools and like places of amusement, manufacturing and industrial operations, funeral services, florists, dispensation of services or merchandise by automatic coin operated vending machines, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and places of business selling mobile homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ordinance provides that it does not apply within the corporate limits or jurisdiction of any municipality in the county unless the governing body thereof shall, by resolution, agree to such ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants' motions to quash the warrants allege the ordinance is unconstitutional for that: (1) It discriminates unreasonably between persons or classes; (2) there is no reasonable relation between the ordinance and the legitimate objectives set forth in the preamble thereof; (3) it does not in fact provide for or require a uniform day of rest in the county; (4) it does not in fact protect and promote the public health, the general welfare, safety and morals of the citizens; (5) the sale on Sunday of a man's shirt, necktie and socks is not detrimental to the public health, the general welfare, the safety or the morals of the citizens of the county; and (6) the ordinance is vague and indefinite.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants sought to quash the indictments on the ground that the county ordinance was unconstitutional. Defendants challenged the denial of their motion, alleging that the trial court erred by refusing to admit into evidence certain magazines that one defendant purchased on a Sunday at a newsstand in another city. Defendants asserted that because obscene magazines could be sold at newsstands, the ordinance did not have a reasonable relation to its stated purpose of providing for the observance of Sunday as a day of rest and promoting the public health, welfare, and morals of the citizens. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly denied the motion to quash. The court found that newsstands were permitted to operate on a Sunday, not because the merchandise was more or less conducive to good morals, but because access to reading materials was conducive to the enjoyment of Sunday as a day of rest. Moreover, the court held that the magazines were properly excluded from evidence because they were purchased in a city in which the county ordinance was inapplicable. Furthermore, the court found no evidence that the ordinance was discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from decision of the North Carolina Court of Appeals, reported in 17 N.C. App. 229, 193 S.E. 2d 485 (1972), finding no error in the trial before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Cooper, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 17 April 1972 Session of Durham Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, William Fred Cameron, known as Babe Cameron, was charged in separate bills of indictment with unlawful possession of a narcotic drug; to wit, 15 bags of heroin, and the unlawful sale of 15 bags of heroin to S. H. Conant, a Durham police officer, for $ 60, on 25 February 1971 in Durham County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At defendant's trial only the State offered evidence.  This evidence tended to show: On 25 February 1971 around 8:30 p.m., Officer Conant and an unnamed individual went to the residence of defendant at 1130 Elmo Street in Durham.  The two men knocked on the door and were let in by a small child.  They asked the child if Babe was at home, and the child answered, &quot;Yes, come on it, he is in the back bedroom.&quot; They went through the kitchen, down a hallway to the back bedroom, and there saw defendant lying on a double bed watching television.  After a short conversation, Conant asked defendant if he had any heroin and, if so, could he buy a half or 15&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bindles.  Defendant answered that he did have some heroin, then left the room, went up the hallway and out the front door.  He was gone approximately a minute and when he returned he asked Conant if he had the money.  Conant handed defendant six ten-dollar bills, and defendant then handed Conant 15 small packs of white powder, later found to contain heroin.  During the time the money and the packs were being exchanged, the individual who accompanied Conant to defendant's home was not present in the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty of both the possession and sale of a narcotic drug, heroin.  Defendant was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on each charge, the sentences to run consecutively.  He appealed to the Court of Appeals, and that court in an opinion by Judge Hedrick, concurred in by Chief Judge Mallard and Judge Morris, found no error.  Defendant appealed to this Court pursuant to G.S. 7A-30(1).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the judgment of the North Carolina Court of Appeals, which affirmed his convictions for possession of heroin and sale of heroin, and the sentence imposed thereon: namely, five years' imprisonment on each conviction, to run consecutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contested the appellate court judgment affirming his convictions for possession and sale of heroin, and the sentence therefor, claiming the trial court erred in: 1) failing to order the state to identify a confidential informant; 2) denying him a bill of particulars; and 3) failing to grant his motions for a continuance, mistrial, and nonsuit. He also argued that possession was a lesser included offense of the sale of a narcotic drug, and thus the convictions should have been merged. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that because defendant presented no defense on the merits and the evidence of guilt was independent information from the informant, there was no error in refusing to order that he be identified. Given that the facts of the crimes could have been obtained from the indictment and exam of the state's witnesses, it was not error to deny a bill of particulars. Because the jury was instructed to ignore any outside news about defendant and only consider the evidence, there was no abuse of discretion in denying the continuance or mistrial. The court found sufficient evidence to defeat the motion for nonsuit and rejected the lesser included offense argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the appellate court judgment, which found no basis to reverse defendant's convictions for the sale and possession of heroin, nor any error in the five-year consecutive sentence given for each offense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals from conviction and sentence imposed in Superior Court under a warrant charging her with inflicting serious injuries on her two-year-old son, in violation of G.S. 14-318.2(a).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only the State offered evidence.  This evidence tends to show: On 4 October 1971 Kelly Joe Fredell, a male child approximately two years old, was brought to the emergency room of Cone Hospital in Greensboro, North Carolina, by his parents, the defendant and her husband.  At the time the child entered the hospital, he was suffering from circulatory collapse and was moribund, a state near death.  The child remained in the hospital for approximately two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four doctors gave testimony related to the child's physical condition at the time of admission.  Their testimony discloses: There were a number of bruises about the child's abdomen, head, and extremities.  The arms were swollen and the abdomen was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  distended.  The child was suffering from multiple fractures of the skull and arms which were in different stages in the healing process.  Additionally, there was a fracture of the eleventh rib.  The older fractures had received no medical attention before the child was admitted to the hospital on 4 October 1971.  Fractures of this nature could not have resulted from the normal activity and play of the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The condition of the child was diagnosed as that of a &quot;battered child,&quot; a term meaning the most extreme form of child abuse, characterized by multiple injuries in different stages of healing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 8 October 1971 defendant, after being duly informed of her constitutional rights and after having signed a waiver of those rights, was questioned by Carolyn Hinson, a detective assigned to the Youth Division of the Greensboro Police Department.  Defendant stated that she had a temper and quite often got mad with her child.  When she became angry, she would beat him with a woman's plastic belt, and that these beatings began when the child was one year old.  Defendant further stated that neither her husband nor any of the child's baby sitters had beaten him, and that on one occasion her&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  mother-in-law warned her about her conduct towards the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals in an opinion by Judge Graham, concurred in by Judges Campbell and Brock, found no error.  Defendant appeals to this Court pursuant to G.S. 7A-30(1) alleging a substantial constitutional question.  </SPAN></P>

The mother appealed, alleging a substantial constitutional ground under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-30(1).

Based on this finding, the court held that the officers made an unlawful entry. The court affirmed the appellate court's holding that defendant had a right to cross-examine the officers with respect to beatings and injuries allegedly inflicted by them upon defendant and others following the shooting. The court affirmed the appellate court's determination that defendant should have been permitted to testify as to information that was relevant to defendant's state of mind in relation to his plea of self-defense. However, the court held that the appellate court erred in concluding that defendant's motion to suppress the testimony of the officers should have been allowed.

However, the evidence against defendant showed that he only threatened the guard with an unloaded gun to open the cell where his friends were being incarcerated after marching the guard to the cell while holding a gun on him. The court held that there was insufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for kidnapping in that there was no evidence that he forced the guard to leave the prison facility, and the momentary detention of the prison guard was insufficient.</SPAN></P>

Also, the officer saw a bag of money in the car, some of which was wrapped in a material bearing the burglarized business' name. One of the occupants of the car fled. Defendants were arrested and taken to the police station, where a warrantless search of their vehicle yielded burglary tools. In their trial for burglary, defendants filed a motion to suppress. The trial court denied the motion, and defendants were convicted, but the court of appeals reversed. On further appeal, the court reversed the decision of the court of appeals and held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-183(a) did not unconstitutionally encroach on defendants' rights. The court further ruled that exigent circumstances existed justifying the warrantless search of the car, as the police had probable cause to arrest defendants on burglary charges, reasonable grounds to believe the car contained evidence of the crime, and it was impracticable to obtain a search warrant at the early morning hour.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge instructed the jury in accordance with the statute, and the jury recommended life imprisonment. Defendant contended on appeal that &sect; 14-17 was unconstitutional and void because of the United States Supreme Court decision in Furman, which declared that Georgia's death penalty violated the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. On appeal, the court held that the Furman case was without significance when the jury returned a verdict recommending life imprisonment. Defendant had no standing to raise the constitutionality of the death penalty or of a statute because it provided for that punishment. It was not error for the trial judge to fail to instruct a jury that defendant's failure to testify in his own behalf was merely the exercise of a privilege afforded him by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-54. Defendant made no request for such instruction. Absent a special request, the judge was not required to instruct the jury that defendant's failure to testify created no presumption against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission claimed that N.C. Gen.

The proposed hospital alleged that &sect; 90-291 was in excess of the constitutional power. The court affirmed the lower court and held that there was no reasonable relation between the denial of the right of a person, association or corporation to construct and operate upon his or its own property, with his or its own funds, an adequately staffed and equipped hospital. Consequently, &sect; 90-291 was a deprivation of liberty without due process of law, in violation of N.C. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Sampson Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted defendant of rape, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-21, and imposed the death penalty. Defendant argued that the death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments in light of a recent decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. The state argued that the death sentence was lawful and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was sentenced to death upon his conviction for rape, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-21, and pursuant to that statute was sentenced to death upon the recommendation of and at the total discretion of the jury. Defendant argued on appeal that a recent decision of the U.S. Supreme Court held that the death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court on review agreed and held that pursuant to the U.S. Supreme Court decision, the statute was unconstitutional because it permitted the jury unfettered discretion in imposing the death penalty. In &sect; 14-21 it was the addition of a proviso in 1949 that granted discretionary authority to juries under the statute that had previously mandated the death penalty. The court held that the 1949 proviso could be severed, restoring the original, nondiscretionary death penalty in an otherwise constitutional statute. The court held that the death penalty could not be applied ex post facto to those who had been sentenced to life imprisonment under the statute, but must be applied prospectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the superior court insofar as it imposed the death penalty upon defendant. The case was remanded with directions to the superior court to enter a sentence of life imprisonment because the statute under which the death penalty was imposed was unconstitutional solely as to the imposition of the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

The three engaged a cab to take them to a location and after arriving there either the first defendant or the second defendant shot and killed the cab driver with a pistol. Defendants contended that the evidence did not warrant an instruction on the felony-murder rule and that the trial court erred in a portion of its instructions. On appeal, the court determined that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17 provided a murder that was committed in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate robbery was deemed to be murder in the first degree. In such cases, the law presumed premeditation and deliberation, and the State was not put to further proof of either. The evidence was sufficient to support a finding by the jury that defendants and the third co-conspirator formed a conspiracy to rob the taxi driver and that in attempting to perpetrate the crime one of the defendants killed the driver. Each defendant was guilty of murder in the first degree. The trial court's instruction cautioning the jurors against taking strong individual positions from the outset of their deliberations did not constitute prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

The evidence warranted a finding that defendant's dominant purpose was to disrupt the emergency room and that the content and manner of his utterances were likely to provoke the average person to retaliation and thus cause an immediate breach of the peace.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order requiring her to disclose facts concerning her liability insurance policy for purposes of discovery and possible settlement of a claim. The court affirmed the lower court's decision enforcing the disclosure because N.C. R. Civ. P. 26(b) and its related amendments allowed for the discovery of the existence and contents of any insurance agreements under which any person carrying on an insurance business may be liable to satisfy a judgment. Furthermore, the court found that disclosure of this information would enable counsel for both sides to make the same realistic appraisal of the case, so that settlement and litigation strategy were based on knowledge and not speculation. The court further found that the right of privacy was not violated with the disclosure by defendant of her liability insurance when neither exploitation nor embarrassment would be involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Godwin, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 26 April 1971 Criminal Session of Cumberland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By an indictment, proper in form, the defendant was charged with the rape of Mrs. Sharon Machamer.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty with a recommendation that the defendant's punishment be imprisonment for life.  From a sentence imposed in accordance with the verdict, the defendant appeals.  He was represented at the trial and on appeal by the Public Defender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Machamer testified concerning the details of the offense, which occurred at her trailer home in Fayetteville shortly after 12:30 p.m. on 2 March 1971.  At the time, she was alone in her home save for her two infant children, her husband having gone to work in the early morning.  Her assailant, whom she had observed in the vicinity about an hour earlier, entered her home and, upon being ordered by her to leave, struck her several times about the head and arms as she resisted him, then forced her into the bedroom, bound her hands and twice committed the offense, together with an unnatural sexual act, stating that he would not kill her and the children if she did what he wanted her to do.  He was a Negro, about six feet&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in height and in his early twenties, dressed in dark colored pants and a navy blue &quot;sweat type jacket&quot; with the hood pulled up so that his eyes, nose and mouth alone were visible.  Upon his departure she notified the police.  Upon their arrival she described her assailant to them.  At the trial she identified a blue sweat shirt (State's Exhibit 1) and a pair of green trousers (State's Exhibit 2) as those worn by her assailant.  At the time of the offense, and for a considerable period prior thereto, a steady rain was falling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early in Mrs. Machamer's testimony the defendant objected to a proposed in-court identification by her of the defendant as her assailant.  The court thereupon conducted an extensive voir dire.  At its outset defendant's counsel suggested to the court that two other witnesses for the State, Mrs. Lora Boras and Mrs. Josefa Williams, might be asked by the solicitor to make in-court identifications of the defendant as the man they had seen in the vicinity of the Machamer trailer at the time of the offense and, if so, the defendant would object on the ground that their identifications, like that of Mrs. Machamer, were tainted by a prior unlawful lineup, this being&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a different lineup from that in which Mrs. Machamer made her identification.  The court thereupon, on voir dire, heard evidence as to the competency of in-court identifications by all three of these witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the voir dire, the court made full findings of fact and ordered:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;1.  That defendant's objection to an in-court identification of the defendant by Mrs. Machamer as her assailant be, and the same is, sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;2.  That the defendant's objection to an in-court identification of the defendant by Mrs. Boras and Mrs. Williams, as the man they saw walking along the street in the rain in the neighborhood of their home and that of Mrs. Machamer, about mid-day on March 2, 1971, will be overruled and that such evidence will, if ordered, be received in evidence in defendant's trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this order the defendant excepted.  Thereupon, the jury returned to the courtroom and Mrs. Machamer's testimony, as above related, proceeded without objection.  Mrs. Boras and Mrs. Williams then testified, without further objection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Boras and Mrs. Williams each identified in court the defendant as the Negro man she saw walking about her own trailer home, across the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  street from that of Mrs. Machamer, immediately prior to and after the assault.  Each testified that, at a lineup conducted by the police on the afternoon of the offense, she observed and identified the defendant as the man she had so seen.  The six men in the lineup were Negroes of about the same size and age.  None of them was then wearing either a blue hooded sweat shirt or green pants such as those worn by the man she observed in the vicinity of the Machamer trailer.  Each witness identified the hooded sweat shirt (State's Exhibit 1) as the one worn by the man so observed by her at the trailer.  Mrs. Williams likewise identified the green pants (State's Exhibit 2).  These were the same garments identified by Mrs. Machamer as those worn by her assailant and by police officers as those taken by them from the defendant.  Both Mrs. Boras and Mrs. Williams also identified shoes (State's Exhibit 3), taken from the defendant at the time of his arrest, as those worn by the man observed by them in the vicinity of the Machamer trailer.  Mrs. Williams testified that she saw the man enter the Machamer trailer and leave it approximately half an hour later, that she followed him in her automobile&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  after he left the Machamer trailer and, upon the arrival of the police a few minutes later, told them what she had seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately one hour after the offense, police officers went to the home of the defendant and found him there with his mother.  They arrested him &quot;for investigation of rape,&quot; giving him the full Miranda warning.  At that time the defendant was wearing the pair of green pants and the shoes identified by the women (State's Exhibits 2 and 3).  The pants were quite wet.  He told the officers he had been out of the house approximately one hour before their arrival and had then been wearing a pair of brown pants and a dark blue sweat shirt, both of which he handed to the officers, the sweat shirt being the one identified by Mrs. Machamer, Mrs. Boras and Mrs. Williams (State's Exhibit 1).  It was &quot;soaking wet&quot; when handed to the officers by the defendant in his home, but the brown pants were dry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant did not testify.  He offered witnesses in his behalf whose testimony was to the effect that he was at a Fort Bragg field house four or five miles from the Machamer trailer at the time Mrs. Machamer's assailant was observed walking about and entering her trailer. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of them testified that he then saw the defendant playing baseball, the other that he then saw him playing basketball and that the defendant, between 12:30 p.m. and 12:45 p.m., &quot;signed out&quot; from the witness a pair of basketball shoes.  The second man was not called at the trial to testify in person and so was not cross-examined.  Due apparently to his absence on military duty, his affidavit, dated 9 March 1971, was received in evidence, it being stipulated that he would so testify if present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant did not offer in evidence any document showing such &quot;signing out&quot; of the shoes by him on 2 March 1971 and there is nothing in the record to indicate that, at the time of his arrest (less than two hours after he was so said to have been playing either baseball or basketball at the field house), he mentioned this circumstance to the arresting officers or that he otherwise called it to the attention of the police or of the solicitor prior to the introduction of the evidence at his trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant's mother and his girl friend testified that, approximately an hour before Mrs. Machamer's assailant was observed walking about the trailers, the defendant left home wearing &quot;brownish&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or &quot;goldish-tan&quot; pants.  His mother testified that he was still wearing these when he returned home shortly before the arrival of the officers, that he did not again go out because of the rain, and that the green pants he was wearing when the officers arrived were dry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered in rebuttal two witnesses who lived in the vicinity of the defendant.  The first testified that she saw him with his girl friend at the bus stop approximately an hour before the offense.  He was then wearing dark green pants and a blue jacket with a hood, these being similar in appearance to the State's Exhibits 1 and 2.  She again saw him walking along the street in front of her home &quot;heading toward town,&quot; about 12:30 p.m., this being the same time his witnesses said he was playing either baseball or basketball at the field house four or five miles away.  He then had the hood of the jacket pulled up around his head, just as did Mrs. Machamer's assailant.  The other rebuttal witness testified that she, too, saw the defendant at approximately 12:30 p.m. walking along the street near her home with the hood of his sweat shirt pulled up over his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all the evidence was in, on motion of the defendant, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the voir dire examination into the question of the lineup, at which Mrs. Boras and Mrs. Williams identified the defendant, was reopened.  Upon the original voir dire hearing, at which the defendant elected not to testify, the evidence was that, prior to the lineup, the defendant was fully advised of his constitutional rights.  He having said he wanted a lawyer at the lineup, the officers sent for one, but, prior to the lawyer's arrival, the defendant voluntarily signed a written waiver of counsel and the lineup proceeded without the presence of counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the reopening of the voir dire, the defendant called Attorney Joe Brown Chandler, Jr., who testified that he was in the district courtroom when the sheriff advised him there was a man in the Detective's Bureau in the basement of the courthouse who was requesting an attorney.  Thereupon Mr. Chandler went to the Detective's Bureau.  Upon his arrival the lineup was in progress.  He was immediately informed by the officers that the suspect, the defendant, had changed his mind and did not want the services of an attorney.  Thereupon, Mr. Chandler took no part in the lineup procedure but observed that all the persons in the lineup were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Negro males of about the same weight and height, all were dressed in casual clothing with nothing remarkable about their dress and that nothing abnormal or constituting an infringement of the defendant's rights in the formation of the lineup was apparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant's counsel then stated his desire to call the defendant for the purpose of testifying on this resumption of the voir dire.  The court refused to permit the defendant to so testify for the reason that he had been present at the original voir dire hearing and had then chosen not to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of this resumption of the voir dire, the court stated it would not disturb its former ruling.  To this the defendant objected and excepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the charge by the court, to which the defendant took no exception, the jury returned and announced its verdict.  Thereupon, the defendant's counsel announced that he desired to make a motion &quot;before the verdict is finally received.&quot; The motion was one for a mistrial on the ground of alleged improprieties by members of the jury during the course of the trial.  The court immediately conducted an extensive hearing and, finding there had been no such irregularities, denied&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the motion.  The court then polled the jury.  Each juror having replied that he or she still assented to the verdict of guilty with the recommendation that the punishment be life imprisonment, the court accepted the verdict and imposed sentence accordingly.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was given notice of his Miranda rights and he requested a lawyer at the lineup. Prior to the lawyer's arrival, defendant voluntarily signed a written waiver of counsel and the lineup proceeded. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that there was nothing in the record to indicate a violation of defendant's constitutional rights in the admission of the identifications. The court held that the lineup procedure was not unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification so as to violate his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-457(a), which did not allow an indigent person to waive the right to counsel in capital cases, was unconstitutional because the statute made an unconstitutional discrimination between indigent defendants and defendants who had enough funds to pay for counsel. The court held that the denial of the right of an indigent person to represent himself, while permitting an affluent defendant to exercise such right, had no reasonable relation to the statute's objective of equal opportunity to prevail at the trial of the case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon a bill of indictment charging him with the murder of Robert Earl DeShazo in Guilford County on 19 April 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that about 3 a.m. on 19 April 1971 Robert Earl DeShazo, an attendant at a Kayo Service Station near Greensboro, North Carolina, was shot and killed.  His body was found on the service station driveway.  Near his right hand was a .32 caliber snub-nosed revolver containing two spent cartridges and five live rounds in the chamber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policeman R. L. Grogan had stopped defendant earlier that night, before the murder, and given him a traffic ticket.  At that time defendant was driving a light-colored Plymouth bearing North Carolina License No. FR-9702.  Between 2:00 and 2:30 a.m. two men in a white Plymouth drove into the Gate Service Station located one-half mile from the Kayo Service Station where DeShazo was killed, and asked for a Coke.  The attendant was suspicious and told the men to get the Cokes themselves, whereupon they drove rapidly away.  The attendant noted the license number of the vehicle was FR-9702.  A short&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  time later he saw the car heading in the direction of the Kayo Service Station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eugene Porterfield operates a cafe on Highway 49 near Roxboro and during the day of 19 April 1971 observed a lightcolored 1967 Plymouth parked near his place of business.  Its left front window was shot out and there was blood on the front seat of the car.  Porterfield notified the highway patrol, and Patrolman A. J. Johnson investigated.  He found the left front window of the car broken out and scattered pieces of glass in the car.  He noticed bloodstains on the driver's seat.  He discovered on the front seat, in plain view, the traffic citation which had been issued to the defendant by Policeman Grogan on the 18th of April.  This citation was offered in evidence as State's Exhibit No. 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctor S. V. Hulbanni testified that on the 19th of April he removed a bullet from the left arm of the defendant in the Norfolk General Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia.  There was no infection, indicating the defendant's wound was fresh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of information received, SBI Agent Henry Poole went to Danville, Virginia, with Deputy Sheriff Worrell.  There they obtained a fugitive warrant for defendant's arrest.  The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  officers then proceeded to the Danville bus station where they met Bus No. 3114 upon its arrival.  They boarded the bus and found the defendant asleep.  He was placed under arrest by Sergeant Wyatt of the Danville Police Department and fully advised of his constitutional rights by SBI Agent Poole.  Defendant was then taken to the Danville Police Station.  Upon entering an office which had been furnished to Agent Poole, the defendant indicated he wanted to make a statement.  Mr. Poole advised the defendant to wait but defendant spoke anyway and said he was coming to turn himself in.  At that point Mr. Poole again advised defendant of his constitutional rights.  Defendant indicated he understood those rights and signed a written &quot;Waiver of Rights.&quot; He then reiterated that he was coming to turn himself in and said, &quot;The hardest thing I ever did was to pull that trigger.&quot; Officer Poole asked him to explain that statement and he said: &quot;I pulled in the service station to rob the man.  He had his hand in his pocket.  I told him to take his hand out of his pocket.  When he did, he had a gun in it.&quot; Defendant then stated that the man shot him in the arm and that he shot the man; that he got&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  back into his car and the man shot a second time, shooting out the glass in the car.  Defendant said he then &quot;sort of laid down&quot; in the front seat of the car and drove away as quickly as he could.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant further related to Officer Poole that prior to the shooting incident he had been to the Kayo Station and had pulled into a Gate Service Station and asked for directions; that he had been engaged in a fight with some Negroes and had gone to Burlington where he obtained his shotgun; that he purchased two dollars' worth of gas at the Kayo Station on his return trip to Greensboro; that after purchasing the gas he went to look for the Negroes but was unable to find them and decided to return to the Kayo Station to rob the man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant further stated that he had been to a doctor in Norfolk, Virginia, who removed a bullet from his arm.  Defendant thereupon took a bullet from his wallet, identifying it as the one removed from his arm by the doctor, and gave it to the officer.  He told the officer that he had thrown the shotgun with which he shot DeShazo into a creek near Greenville and gave minute directions leading to a bridge on a dirt road from which he had thrown the weapon.  Those&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  directions were followed and the weapon was recovered from the creek.  This weapon, a sawed-off shotgun, was offered in evidence over defendant's objection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E. B. Pearce, a specialist in firearms identification with the State Bureau of Investigation, testified that he compared the bullet removed from defendant's arm with a bullet he test fired from the .32 caliber pistol found on the service station driveway near the right hand of Robert Earl DeShazo, the deceased, and found many identical characteristics; that in his opinion the bullet taken from defendant's arm was fired from State's Exhibit 5, the .32 caliber revolver.  The bullet was offered in evidence over defendant's objection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon defendant's timely objection the jury was excused and a voir dire conducted with respect to the foregoing inculpatory statements made to SBI Agent Poole and other officers.  Both the State and the defendant offered evidence on the voir dire, at the conclusion of which the court made findings of fact and concluded that defendant's statement to the officers &quot;was made freely, voluntarily and understandingly, after the defendant had been warned as per the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision and his constitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rights explained to him.&quot; Defendant's motion to suppress the evidence was denied; and the bullet taken from his arm, the shotgun recovered from the creek, and defendant's statement to Officer Poole were admitted in evidence before the jury over defendant's objection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered no evidence before the jury.  The jury convicted him of murder in the first degree and recommended life imprisonment.  Judgment was pronounced accordingly, and the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court assigning errors noted in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Guilford County Superior Court. Defendant was tried upon a bill of indictment charging him with murder. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence. A jury convicted defendant of murder in the first degree and recommended life imprisonment. The trial court pronounced judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon his arrival at a police station defendant indicated he wanted to make a statement. He had already been given his Miranda warning upon arrest. An officer told defendant to wait to make his statement and then read defendant's Miranda rights to him. Defendant then signed a waiver form acknowledging that he had read the warnings himself and understood his rights. The form included an acknowledgement that he was waiving his constitutional right to the presence of counsel. Then, without any questions on the part of the police, defendant reiterated his earlier statement that he was coming to turn himself in and made inculpatory statements about the killing. On appeal, he argued that his statement was the result of &quot;custodial interrogation&quot;, and its admissibility was prohibited by former N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-457(a) (1969). The court held that: (1) defendant's statement, given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influence, was admissible in evidence; (2) volunteered statements of any kind were not barred by the Fifth Amendment, and their admissibility was not affected by the Miranda rule; and (3) the police were not required to gag defendant when he wanted to confess.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Finding that defendant's trial was free from prejudicial error, the court upheld the verdict and judgment from the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Bailey, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 6 December 1971 Criminal Session, Cumberland Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried upon a bill of indictment, proper in form, charging him with the murder of Marilyn Best on 24 June 1971.  Being indigent, he was represented by the public defender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that on the night of 24 June 1971 Deputy Sheriff Douglas Hartley was on patrol on Highway 401 south.  At approximately 12:15 a.m. he saw defendant sitting in a gray 1964 Thunderbird in the parking lot of Johnson Furniture Store on Raeford Road.  The dome light of the car was on and defendant was apparently nude.  Officer Hartley pulled into the parking lot and stopped defendant when he started to pull out.  The officer observed defendant &quot;making a motion like he was knocking something out of his lap onto the floorboard of the car.&quot; The officer got out of his vehicle, approached defendant's car on the driver's side, and observed he was dressed only in Bermuda shorts.  He was sitting under the wheel with a knife in his hand.  &quot;I asked him to lay the knife down and open the car door and when he did this he made a kicking motion with his left leg and foot as if he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were kicking something under the seat.&quot; He laid the knife on the dashboard of the car, and when he got out the officer reached under the seat of the car and found a .22 caliber revolver.  It was located directly under the driver's seat on the extreme left where the frame joins the floorboard of the car.  The weapon (State's Exhibit 1) was a High Standard .22 caliber, nine-shot revolver, serial No. 2206367.  Defendant stated his name upon request, and the officer informed him he was under arrest for carrying a concealed weapon.  The officer then read defendant's constitutional rights to him from a prepared copy he kept in his patrol car, and defendant acknowledged that he understood his rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Hartley then broke the weapon down and found that it contained six .22 long rifle shells and three empty chambers.  The officer then asked defendant where he had been.  Upon objection the court excused the jury and, after conducting a voir dire examination during which only Officer Hartley testified, found facts substantially as above narrated and further found that Officer Hartley &quot;had reasonable grounds to believe that something had been concealed under the floor of the car and . . &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  . that it was reasonable to believe that said article constituted the fruits or evidence of a crime.&quot; In addition, the court found &quot;that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that if said vehicle was not properly searched it would be moved and such evidence or fruits of crime as might be in it would be disposed of and would never again be available to the police.&quot; The court further found that at the time of the arrest, and prior to making any statement, defendant had been given the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings and had said he understood his rights; that defendant was not suspected of any crime which would involve a penalty of over six months; that he was not required to waive his rights to an attorney or other constitutional rights in writing; and that there was no showing that defendant was an indigent person at that time.  Based on such findings the court concluded that Officer Hartley had probable cause to search defendant's automobile without a warrant and that defendant's answer in response to the officer's questions should be admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned to the box and Officer Hartley continued his testimony as follows: &quot;After I charged Mr. Ratliff with carrying&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a concealed weapon, I asked him where he had been and he said out off Fisher Road and I asked him what he shot out off Fisher Road and he said he had just shot a woman.&quot; The officer then asked him for the location off Fisher Road where a woman had been shot and, over objection, the officer was permitted to testify: &quot;He told me then, at that point, that I was a cop, and for me to find out.&quot; Officer Hartley asked no more questions at that time and busied himself filling out a storage report to have defendant's automobile stored.  Defendant volunteered an unsolicited statement that the officer &quot;should try to find the woman, she may not be dead and then I could be a hero.&quot; This statement prompted Officer Hartley to try again, without success, to learn the woman's name and the location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point Officer Hartley made an examination of defendant's car and testified, over objection, that he found a hatchet on the back floorboard of the car, a lady's necklace-type watch on the floorboard at the front on the right side and some wet one-dollar bills stuffed between the seat and console on the driver's side of the automobile.  Defendant said the watch belonged to his wife, and Officer Hartley&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  left it in the car on the right front floorboard where he found it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Hartley then took defendant to the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office.  Around 9 a.m. that same morning, Officer Hartley returned to the Johnson Furniture Store parking lot where he found two spent .22 long rifle casings &quot;in an area that would have been in front and to the left&quot; of the point where defendant's car was parked when the officer first arrived on the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following morning while cleaning his patrol car, Officer Hartley examined the back seat area where defendant sat the previous night on the trip to the Sheriff's office and found, behind the back seat, an identification card similar to those issued to Army dependents with a picture of Marilyn Best on it and bearing the following inscription: &quot;Issued on 8th June, 1970, expiration 27th May, 1973, issued to Marilyn Best, color of eyes, brown, color of hair, brown, five-nine, weighing 140.  Date of birth, 26 October 1951.  Grade, name, Private Samuel W. Best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to a radio call during the day of June 24, Officer Hartley went to the trailer home of Marilyn Best with a man named Paul Cunningham, a neighbor of Mrs. Best.  The trailer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  door was open.  Inside, Marilyn Best lay half in and half out of an easy chair.  Her hair was matted with blood, and she had a wound on the outside of the left thigh.  She was dressed in panties and some type of dress or nightgown which was above her waist.  There were two bullet holes in the wall behind the chair.  Beside the kitchen sink lay an empty lady's pocketbook.  The sink was full of water and the contents of the pocketbook, &quot;papers and things,&quot; were floating in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Best was having difficulty breathing.  Her head was slumped over the left arm of the chair.  She was moaning and apparently unconscious.  Mrs. Best died in Duke Hospital five days later as a result of her wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Cunningham, neighbor and acquaintance of Marilyn Best and her husband, testified that he was the owner of the .22 caliber pistol taken from defendant's car by Officer Hartley and that he had loaned the pistol to Mrs. Best on the Saturday before she was shot.  He said she wanted to borrow it for her protection and was apprehensive because a car had stopped two or three times in her driveway.  This witness further stated that at approximately 5:33 a.m. on June 24 he was driving by the Best trailer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and saw the lights on and the front door open; that he stopped to investigate, saw Mrs. Best moaning and apparently unconscious and called the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samuel Best, husband of the deceased, identified the lady's necklace-type watch found in defendant's car (State's Exhibit 2) as the property of his wife.  He said it was given to her by her father and she had worn it many times.  Mr. Best also identified State's Exhibit 5 as the Army dependents identification card issued to his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SBI Agent E. B. Pierce testified that in his opinion the two .22 caliber cartridge casings found on the parking lot where defendant was parked when apprehended (State's Exhibits 4A and 4B) had been fired in the .22 caliber revolver found in defendant's car (State's Exhibit 1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered no evidence.  The jury convicted him of murder in the first degree and recommended life imprisonment.  Judgment was pronounced accordingly and defendant appealed to the Supreme Court assigning errors noted in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;No error.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction from the Criminal Session, Cumberland Superior Court (North Carolina) for murder in the first degree. Defendant contended that the warrantless search of his automobile was illegal and that his statements to a police officer after his arrest should not have been admitted because he was entitled to counsel during such in-custody interrogation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The evidence showed that defendant was found by a police officer late at night in the parking lot of a furniture store, sitting in the backseat of an automobile, seminude, and holding a knife. After his arrested for a weapon possession, the officer searched the automobile and found a gun under the seat and defendant then told the officer that he had just shot a woman. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and concluded that the officer's warrantless search of the automobile was reasonable by Fourth Amendment standards, and the fruits of the search were properly admitted in evidence. The court ruled that the officer acted on with probable cause to believe that defendant's car contained contraband of some sort. The court dismissed defendant's argument that his statements to the officer were erroneously admitted because he was an indigent, charged with capital murder, undergoing an in-custody interrogation, and was entitled to counsel during the questioning. Defendant's comments to the officer were admissible since there was no in-custody interrogation and was not a murder suspect yet.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the superior court's judgment of conviction against defendant for murder in the first degree and concluded that the police officer acted on reasonable grounds and with probable cause when he searched defendant's car on the spot. The court held that the conversation between defendant and the police officer after defendant's arrest was not an in-custody interrogation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Judge Harry C. Martin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 1 March 1971 Session of Buncombe, transferred from the Court of Appeals for initial appellate review by the Supreme Court under its general order of 31 July 1970, entered pursuant to G.S. 7A-31(b) (4) (1969).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a part of State Highway Project No 8.3023203 (Project), the reconstruction of Highway No. 23, also known as Riverside Drive, the North Carolina State Highway Commission (Commission) instituted this proceeding on 12 December 1969 to condemn six separately described portions of an 8.61-acre tract of land belonging to Farm Equipment Company, Inc. (defendant).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the six tracts sought to be condemned three are drainage easements totaling 0.13 acres, and one is a .01-acre, triangular tract which will be a part of the new right-of-way for Riverside Drive.  Commission's right to condemn these four tracts is conceded, and is not involved in this appeal.  The two tracts in dispute are separately described in the complaint as &quot;Railway Exchange Area -- Tract One&quot; and &quot;Tract Two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the restricted purpose of description and location of the separate tracts sought to be condemned and of the railroad easement on the property, Commission&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  attached to its complaint a map of defendant's property, made by J. H. Price, surveyor, on 30 October 1968.  The complaint and map show, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant's 8.61-acre tract is bounded on the east by Riverside Drive; on the north, south and west by other landowners.  The French Broad River flows across the tract roughly along its western border.  A spur track of the Southern Railway (Southern) traverses the land on a curve from north to south over a 20-foot right-of-way.  At defendant's north property line, the east line of this right-of-way is approximatetly 125 feet from the west line of Riverside Drive as it then existed; at defendant's southern boundary, the east line of the right-of-way is approximately 35 feet from Riverside Drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracts One and Two, which contain 0.35 acres and 0.15 acres respectively, are narrow strips of land lying on each side of Southern's spur track right-of-way as it crosses defendant's property.  The eastern line of Tract One is the western boundary of the right-of-way.  At its north end, Tract One is 20.9 feet wide; at the south end, 28.52 feet wide.  The western line of Tract Two is the eastern line of the right-of-way.  At the north end, it&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is 10.05 feet wide; at the south, 1.5 feet wide.  See the composite, illustrative sketch map attached hereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon allegations summarized below (our enumeration), Commission seeks to acquire the fee simple title to the two tracts described above for the purpose of conveying them in fee to Southern:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) Southern owns land which Commission must acquire for Project.  Southern has agreed in writing to accept Tracts One and Two in lieu of a portion of its property which Commission requires.  Commission has determined by resolution &quot;that an economy in the expenditure of public funds and the improvement and convenience in safety of the highway can be effected through the condemnation and exchange of the property described herein.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) Acting under G.S. 136-18(16), and after having complied with its terms, Commission condemns the fee simple title to Tracts One and Two &quot;solely for the purpose of conveying said areas to the Southern Railway Company.  The Commission condemns and appropriates no access to or from the above described railway exchange areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answering, defendant moved to dismiss the action upon the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  granted and, as a second and third defense, alleged:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) Southern's present easement over defendant's land is entirely sufficient for its legitimate purposes and neither Commission nor Southern has any necessity for Tracts One and Two;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) Commission's attempt to condemn these tracts for the purpose of conveying them to Southern is not for a public purpose;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) G.S. 136-18(16) does not authorize Commission to condemn land for the purpose of transferring it from one private owner to another under the circumstances of this case; if the statute does purport to authorize such a condemnation, to that extent it violates N.C. Constitution art. I, &sect; 19 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 22 June 1971 Judge Martin conducted a pretrial hearing, presumably under G.S. 136-108.  His judgment recites that, in ruling upon defendant's motion &quot;to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action upon which relief can be granted,&quot; he considered the pleadings, briefs, and oral argument presented by counsel for both parties as the basis for his findings of fact.  The record and briefs of both appellant and appellee show that in addition to the pleadings, Commission&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  presented to Judge Martin, and he did not exclude, the following documents:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) Minutes of Commission's meeting on 5 February 1970, at which it adopted the resolution referred to in the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) Written agreement between Commission and Southern, entered into 20 November 1968, with reference to the relocation of the spur track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) Affidavit of State Highway Engineer Joseph Buckner, made 12 March 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) Final plat showing &quot;the property affected by the taking and superimposed thereon the nature and extent of the taking.&quot; This plat is the Price map.  To it was appended Southern's Drawing No. 12-232 which showed the entire spur track system, a part of which traverses defendant's property.  At the hearing these maps were introduced without restriction and without objection.  From these maps it appears that the trackage on defendant's land, about 750 feet, is a small segment of the spur track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant presented no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minutes of Commission's meeting on 5 February 1970 show that, in addition to the statement alleged in the complaint, the resolution adopted at this meeting also contained the following: For Southern's property, which Commission must acquire for Project, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Commission has agreed to furnish Southern Railway Company alternate property or pay the value of the property acquired as just compensation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement referred to in the foregoing minutes is the contract which Southern and Commission executed on 20 November 1968 as a part of the submission of Project as a Federalaid highway.  Commission agreed, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (enumeration ours):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) In the construction of Project, Southern's tracks along Riverside Drive must be relocated.  In connection therewith Southern and Commission will each perform certain specified work.  Commission will reimburse Southern for the work it performs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) In consideration of a quitclaim deed from Southern for those portions of its right-of-way located within Project, Commission will acquire and convey to Southern, as partial payment, &quot;an unencumbered fee simple title&quot; to the strip of land outlined in orange (Tracts One and Two) on Drawing No. 12-232.  (Property lines are not shown on this drawing, but defendant's Tracts One and Two are a portion of the total land which Commission would convey to Southern.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) After its conveyance of the above described property to Southern, if any individual or company&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shall apply to Southern for a vehicular crossing at grade over the spur track, &quot;Commission shall cause such applicant to enter into an agreement with Company concerning said grade crossings, said agreement to be in the usual form prepared by Company and to contain the Company's standard language, including, but not limited to, the obligation of such applicant to construct and maintain such crossings at the applicant's cost and expense, and in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Company, and the assumption by the applicant of all responsibility and liability resulting from the use of such crossing or from railroad operations at or in the vicinity thereof.&quot; (The source of Commission's power to comply with this requirement after its conveyance in fee simple is not apparent.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the affidavit of James Buckner, highway engineer residing in Buncombe County, it is averred (enumeration ours):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) The strip map (Drawing No. 12-232) correctly shows the location of those sections of Southern's tracks and right-of-way which Commission must appropriate in the construction of Project.  It also shows the necessary relocation and additional lateral right-of-way required to upgrade&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the tracks for consideration of safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) According to the Price map, the tracks over the right-of-way across defendant's property have been laterally relocated in a westerly direction 8.47 feet at Southern station 18 + 62.97, the point where defendant's south boundary line intersects Southern's present right-of-way.  This westerly relocation continues in a northerly direction, a distance of 130 feet to Southern station 19 + 91.26 and from there continues northerly &quot;across said parcel of land directly on the 'Old' centerline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) The relocated and upgraded tracks have been raised in elevation 6.9 feet at defendant's south line and 3.3 feet at the north line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) The additional right-of-way across defendant's property is necessary: (a) to provide for the westerly lateral relocation referred to above and to provide horizontal support for the elevated tracks; and (b) to meet safety requirements for tracks paralleling the upgraded highway facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the pleadings, the foregoing documents, &quot;briefs and oral argument of counsel,&quot; Judge Martin made findings of fact and conclusions of law.  (Here we note that the briefs and oral arguments are not in the record for our consideration.) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Judge Martin's findings of fact are summarized as follows (enumeration ours):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) Southern has a right-of-way for a spur track over defendant's land.  The Price map accurately illustrates defendant's property, the various portions of it which Commission seeks to condemn, and Southern's existing right-of-way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) Southern's right-of-way over defendant's land is only an easement; Southern does not hold the right-of-way in fee simple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) Tracts One and Two lie on either side of the spur track across defendant's property.  They are not within the right-of-way required for Project, and are not themselves essential for its construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) Certain portions of the spur track located south of defendant's property do lie within the area required for Project, and those portions of the track must be relocated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) &quot;[P]rior to the institution of this lawsuit . . . the general public has a right to cross Southern's right-of-way over defendant's land. . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) Defendant's property is the last property served by the sidetrack and the public's interest in its maintenance will not be affected by the outcome of this lawsuit.  The spur track in question &quot;serves various customers of the railroad&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the public in general, and the defendant does not utilize the sidetrack where it crosses its property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(7) Project requires no relocation of the tracks outside of the pre-existing right-of-way on defendant's property.  Under the contract between Southern and Commission it will not be necessary to relocate any portion of the railroad track outside the pre-existing right-of-way across defendant's property.  Any work required by the contract between Commission and Southern can be done within the existing right-of-way insofar as the track crossing defendant's property is concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(8) Commission can acquire Southern's tracks which lie within Project's right-of-way and effect their relocation without taking Tracts One and Two from defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(9) No facts substantiate Commission's findings in its minutes of 5 February 1970 that &quot;economy, convenience, and safety&quot; will be effected by the acquisition and exchange of defendant's property for the relocation of Southern's spur track south of defendant's property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(10) If Commission is permitted to condemn and convey the fee in Tracts One and Two to Southern the railway will then own in fee two parallel strips of land through defendant's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  property, one strip on each side of its easement which bisects defendant's property in a north and south direction, and defendant and the public will be deprived of access to and from the remaining portions of defendant's property except by permission of the railroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the foregoing facts Judge Martin concluded as a matter of law:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) Commission cannot condemn Tracts One and Two and convey them in fee to Southern in exchange for its property utilized in Project, for such a taking in fee would constitute the appropriation of defendant's property for a private purpose of the railroad and would permit Southern to acquire a greater estate in the property than it could condemn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) G.S. 136-18(16), a valid statute when properly construed, would be unconstitutional if applied to the facts of this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) &quot;Although a general acquisition of the railray's easement through one unified plan by substitute compensation of alternate right-of-way across third party's properties may be proper,&quot; it is not necessary to take any part of defendant's property to carry out such unified plan, since there is no need to relocate the tracks outside the pre-existing easement on defendant's land. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (4) The substitute condemnation of defendant's property would not result in &quot;economizing public funds through a reduction of the amount for all damage in completing the highway project&quot;; nor does it appear (a) that the taking of defendant's property would be the best means of compensating Southern for &quot;the first taking&quot; or (b) that the taking would benefit the public in any way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based upon the foregoing conclusions, Judge Martin dismissed the action with prejudice insofar as it related to Tracts One and Two.  Commission excepted to each finding of fact and conclusion of law and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, the North Carolina State Highway Commission, sought review of a trial court judgment that dismissed the substitute condemnation proceeding the commission brought against defendant landowners to obtain land for a railroad pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136-108 (1965). The Court of Appeals (North Carolina) transferred the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner claimed that the commission failed to state a claim for relief, the railroad's existing easement was sufficient for its purposes, the taking of the land was not for a public purpose, and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136-18(16) did not authorize the commission to condemn land for the purpose of transferring it from one private owner to another, which violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The commission claimed that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136-18(16) empowered it to condemn the land in fee simple for the purpose of exchange with the railroad. The court vacated the judgment and remanded to the trial court. The court held that the railroad only had the power to condemn land for a right-of-way, which could only be an easement, and the commission could not exercise any more power than the railroad. The court further held that the trial court had improperly disregarded the commission's expert testimony by affidavit, which was uncontroverted, and the trial court was required to make a finding as to whether or not the railroad's existing easement was adequate for its purposes prior to the landowner's property being condemned for more right-of-way.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the trial court's judgment dismissing the commission's condemnation proceeding and remanded to the trial court to make a determination of whether or not the railroad's right-of-way was sufficient for its purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c1"><SPAN CLASS="c4">June 16, 1972, Filed </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by the State from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Kivett, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 6 December 1971 Schedule &quot;B&quot; Session of Forsyth, heard prior to determination by the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of Commissioners of Forsyth County adopted a comprehensive zoning resolution dividing the entire county, outside the corporate limits of the City of Winston-Salem, the Town of Kernersville and the adjacent areas within one mile thereof, into seven use districts, specifying the uses which may be made of land in each such district and imposing special requirements with reference to certain such uses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution establishes a &quot;general industrial district,&quot; designated I-3, &quot;to provide for industries which generally require specially selected locations in the community.&quot; Auto wrecking yards, building material salvage yards, general salvage yards and scrap metal processing yards are permitted in an I-3 district only.  Such yard, within an I-3 district, must be operated in conformity to certain requirements.  One of these, the validity of which is here in question, is:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;A solid fence or wall not less than 6 feet in height shall be erected not less than 50 feet from the edge of any public road adjoining the yards, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  a screen of evergreen shrubs or trees not less than 8 feet in height at maturity shall be planted on the other boundaries of the property * * *.  Any such fence shall be painted, unless the fence is made of aluminum or rust-proof metal or other prefinished material, and any fence or shrubs or trees shall be maintained in sound condition.  No such fence shall contain advertising other than lettering which identifies the operation carried on within the enclosure.  * * * Such uses existing at the time of the adoption of this resolution shall be provided with screening, as herein specified, with [sic] a period of three years after the date of adoption of this Resolution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution declares that the purpose of special conditions so imposed upon the operation of these and other types of businesses is &quot;to insure reasonable standards of community safety and acceptability consistent with advanced industrial practices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution further provides that the violation of any of its provisions after the expiration of ten days following the service of notice upon the violator shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed fifty dollars or imprisonment for not more than&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thirty days, or both, each day of the continuance of such violation beyond such ten day period to be deemed a separate offense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Misdemeanor Summons, or warrant, was issued and served upon the defendant, charging:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;[T]he defendant * * * did unlawfully, and wilfully fail to erect on the boundaries of his real property that adjoin public roads a solid fence or wall not less than 6 feet in height not less than 50 feet from the edge of the public roads (said roads being State Road No. 1448 of the State Highway System and Old 421 Highway) adjoining the real property owned and operated by the defendant as an auto-wrecking yard, said auto-wrecking yard owned and operated by the defendant being known as Westside Motors, said failure to erect said solid fence or wall being in violation of an ordinance of Forsyth County bearing the caption 'Zoning Resolution, Forsyth County, North Carolina' and enacted by the Board of Commissioners of Forsyth County on April 3, 1967, as amended from time to time.  * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the district court the defendant moved to quash the warrant, which motion the district court allowed on the ground that the provisions of the zoning resolution pertaining to fencing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or screening of the boundaries of an auto wrecking yard are unconstitutional in that they are based purely on aesthetic grounds, without any real or substantial relationship to the public health, safety, or welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State appealed to the superior court.  There the defendant again moved to quash the warrant on the ground that the zoning resolution is in violation of Art.  I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 17, now &sect; 19, of the North Carolina Constitution and of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, he contending that it is an arbitrary deprivation of liberty, bearing no reasonable relation to the public health, morals, order or safety or to the general welfare, being based solely upon aesthetic considerations and being an arbitrary discrimination against operators of a wrecking yard on property adjoining a public road.  The superior court allowed the motion to quash on the ground that the above quoted requirement is based solely upon aesthetic grounds, without any real or substantial relationship to the public health, safety or general welfare, and is, therefore, in violation of the above mentioned constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this decision the State appeals, assigning&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as error: (1) The refusal of the court to permit the State to introduce the testimony of three witnesses concerning the manner of operation of the defendant's auto wrecking yard; and (2) the entry of the order quashing the warrant.  The State contends that the requirement of the resolution, here in question, was &quot;neither solely nor predominantly based upon aesthetics or aesthetic consideration,&quot; but bears a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety and welfare.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state challenged the judgment of the Schedule B Session of the Superior Court of Forsyth County (North Carolina), which granted defendant's motion to quash a misdemeanor summons that had been issued against him for an alleged violation of a city zoning resolution pertaining to fencing around salvage yards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a city passed a zoning resolution that set forth fencing guidelines for salvage yard, defendant failed to comply with the resolution, and a misdemeanor summons was issued against him. Defendant filed a motion to quash the summons, and the trial court granted the motion. The state appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that the motion to quash was properly granted because the resolution was unconstitutional and invalid. Defendant's due process rights were violated because the statute was so vague that he was required to guess at the required location of the fence or face a fine. Although the state argued that the restriction was necessary to promote roadway safety, the restriction was a deprivation of property without due process of law because there was no reasonable basis for supposing that the restriction would promote public safety. Further, even if the resolution did promote public safety, defendant's due process rights would have been violated by the taking of a portion of his property without compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment that granted defendant's motion to quash the misdemeanor summons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant appeals from decision of the Court of Appeals, 13 N.C. App. 120, upholding judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Copeland, S.J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 7 June 1971 Session, Orange Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in a two-count bill of indictment with forgery and uttering a forged check.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that on 15 January 1971 at approximately 2 p.m. defendant entered the place of business of Central Carolina Farmers, Inc., in Carrboro and requested Mrs. Irma Davis, who worked there, to cash a fifty-dollar check.  Mrs. Davis asked who the maker was, and defendant replied: &quot;That's the man I work for.&quot; The name appearing on the check as maker was Bennie Duty, and the name appearing on the check as payee was Lena Mae Hopkins.  Defendant endorsed the check in the presence of Mrs. Davis by writing the name &quot;Lena Mae Hopkins&quot; on the back of the check, and Mrs. Davis thereupon took the check and gave defendant fifty dollars in currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The check was deposited in due course and returned stamped &quot;Account Closed.&quot; Mrs. Davis contacted the police and described the person who gave her the check as &quot;a black female, with red hair, small build and freckles.  On this particular date, January 15, 1971, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  she was wearing a dark blue dress.  I was questioned by Officer Blackwood as to how many times I had seen Elizabeth Cradle prior to the date of January 15, 1971, to which I replied that I had seen her fifty, seventy-five or more times.&quot; Although she had seen Elizabeth Cradle many times, Mrs. Davis did not know her name.  However, based on the information and the description, the officer swore out a warrant for Elizabeth Cradle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bennie R. Duty testified that he did not sign the check and did not authorize anyone else to sign his name to it.  He identified the check in question as one of his personalized checks, with his name (Bennie R. Duty) and his address (115 Carr Street, Carrboro) printed on it.  He said that for several months prior to 1 February 1971 he had been in prison serving a six-month term for driving under the influence of alcohol and had not been at his home address during the month of January 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earl Eversole testified that he lived at 115 Carr Street, Carrboro, North Carolina, in the same house where Bennie Duty lived; that Mr. Duty was absent during the month of January; that in December 1970, between Christmas and New Year's, defendant came to his house and cleaned&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  up a room adjoining the room in which Mr. Duty lived; that after Mr. Duty returned home he complained about his checks being gone -- &quot;he calculated that he was missing about sixty checks.&quot; This witness stated that the room defendant cleaned opens out into the hall and doesn't open into Mr. Duty's room; that the house stays open rather than locked -- &quot;I do not lock the door.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State rested its case and defendant moved for a directed verdict of not guilty as to both counts.  As to the count charging forgery, the motion was allowed; as to the count charging uttering, the motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, as a witness in her own behalf, testified that she is married to Irving Sylvester Cradle, is twenty-two years of age, and has three children.  Neither she nor her husband has ever been on welfare.  For the last six months she has been staying home taking care of her children.  &quot;My mother's name is Lena Mae Rigsbee but she went under the name of Lena Mae Hopkins.  She wasn't alive on January 15, 1971; she died about two years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant further testified that at two o'clock in the afternoon of January 15 she was at home &quot;as far as I can remember.&quot; She denied she had ever seen&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the check in question and denied going into the Farmers Exchange on January 15.  She admitted working for Mr. Eversole between Christmas and New Year's cleaning an upstairs room for him but denied having gone into Mr. Duty's room, &quot;although I have known him for two or three years.&quot; She said she had never taken anything from any of the rooms at Mr. Eversole's.  She said she did not know Mrs. Davis and had never given her a check of any kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's motion for directed verdict of not guilty on the uttering count in the bill of indictment was renewed at the close of all the evidence and denied.  Following the arguments and the charge of the court, the jury convicted defendant of uttering a forged check, as charged, and defendant was sentenced to a term of not less than seven nor more than ten years.  The Court of Appeals found no error, and defendant appealed to the Supreme Court, allegedly as of right, asserting involvement of substantial constitutional questions and assigning errors noted in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Orange County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted her of uttering a forged check.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant cashed a check, falsely claiming that the payor was her employer and that she was the named payee. The check was returned stamped as account closed. The check was among blank checks that had been stolen from the home of the payor. Defendant claimed that as an indigent she was denied counsel at the preliminary hearing. On appeal, the court determined that defendant had a constitutional right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to assistance of counsel at the preliminary hearing. The test whether defendant was prejudiced by the absence of counsel at the preliminary hearing was whether the denial of counsel was harmless error. A preliminary hearing was simply an inquiry into whether defendant should be discharged or whether there was probable cause to submit the State's evidence to the grand jury and seek a bill of indictment that defendant should be placed upon trial. The record did not show that the absence of counsel at the preliminary hearing in any way contaminated the proceedings at trial. In addition, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a continuance to prepare for trial because it was not supported by affidavit or other proof.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in separate bills of indictment with the first degree murder of Fannie Alice Whitfield, his mother-in-law, and the first degree murder of Joyce Janet Anderson, his wife, on 29 June 1971.  Upon arraignment defendant entered pleas of not guilty.  The cases were thereupon consolidated for trial, over defendant's objection, and a jury was selected and empaneled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show the facts narrated below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Lionel Anderson and his wife Joyce Janet Anderson lived in Greenville, North Carolina.  Joyce was the daughter of Willie Herbert Whitfield and Fannie Alice Whitfield who lived near Williamston on Highway No. 17 in Martin County.  On 29 June 1971 defendant called his wife's father to come after her.  Mr. Whitfield went to Greenville and took his daughter to his home near Williamston.  That same afternoon defendant left Greenville taking his .20 gauge shotgun with him.  He went to the Whitfield home, asked for his wife, and was told she was at the store.  He left and drove toward the store where he saw his wife driving a car and thereupon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  turned around and followed her back to the Whitfield home.  He parked his car in the back-yard and talked to his wife for thirty or forty minutes.  Defendant and his wife had been fussing since Tuesday morning, June 27, and defendant was trying to persuade her to return home.  She told him she was going to Baltimore to live with the parents of a man who was the father of a baby born to her before her marriage to defendant.  Defendant thereupon shot his wife Joyce Anderson with the .20 gauge shotgun.  Mrs. Whitfield came to the back door, stepped out on the ground and defendant shot her in the stomach with his shotgun.  He reloaded, stepped forward and shot her again and she fell to the ground near the back steps.  Meanwhile, Joyce Anderson ran toward a neighbor's house and the defendant followed her.  Joyce stumbled and fell in the yard, and defendant stood over her with the shotgun and fired another shot into her body.  Defendant then walked toward his car in the Whitfield yard and saw Mrs. Whitfield moving on the ground.  He approached her and said, &quot;You are the cause of all this,&quot; placed his gun against her neck and fired again.  As defendant approached his car to drive away he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was shot twice in the back by Melvin Whitley, a nineteen-year-old boy who was staying at the Whitfield home.  Numerous shotgun pellets entered his body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coroner found both women dead when he arrived on the scene.  He testified that Mrs. Whitfield had a large wound about the size of a quarter under her right breast and a large wound in her stomach below the navel about the size of a baseball, and a large wound behind her left ear.  Joyce Anderson had a large wound near the top of her chest on the left side near the heart region and twenty-five to thirty small holes in her arm.  When the coroner arrived the bodies were still lying in the yard where they had fallen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant drove at a high rate of speed to his mother's home in Greenville where he was arrested, taken to the hospital for treatment of his wounds which apparently were not serious, and lodged in jail.  With his counsel present and after being fully warned of his constitutional rights, defendant made a statement to the officers in which he related his family difficulties and said he remembered shooting his wife only once and Mrs. Whitfield only once.  Defendant identified the shotgun he used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant testified as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a witness in his own behalf.  His testimony shows that he was thirty-six years of age, had served as a special policeman in the City of Washington, D.C. for two years, and had never been in any trouble.  On Monday preceding June 29 he had seen a man running from his home and this had caused serious arguments between him and his wife.  On June 29 he called Mr. and Mrs. Whitfield to come to his home and they came.  The Whitfields decided to take their daughter home.  After they had gone defendant began drinking.  He tried unsuccessfully to call his wife several times and finally decided to drive to Williamston to talk with her.  The shotgun was already in the trunk of his car, but he took it out and laid it on the back seat when he left the house.  When he knocked on the door at the Whitfield residence he was advised that his wife had gone to the store.  He went looking for her and followed her back to the Whitfield home.  She took her two babies in the house and returned to the backyard where they talked.  Defendant had consumed ten cans of beer and about half of a fifth of liquor.  He begged his wife to go back home with him, and she told him she was going to Baltimore to stay with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the mother of a boy who had fathered her baby before she married defendant.  Defendant then testified that he remembered little of what happened thereafter; that he doesn't remember how many times he fired or who he shot on that occasion; that he didn't go to Williamston to hurt anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each case the jury convicted the defendant of murder in the first degree, and in each case the court pronounced a death sentence.  Defendant appealed to the Supreme Court assigning errors discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged judgments of the Martin County Superior Court (North Carolina). Defendant was charged in separate bills of indictment with two first degree murders. The cases were consolidated for trial, over defendant's objection. A jury convicted defendant, and death sentences were imposed pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-162.1. The trial court denied defendant's motion for nonsuit at the close of the State's evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded not guilty to both murders, which were committed while &sect; 15-162.1, death penalty provisions applicable only to those defendants who asserted their right to plead not guilty, were in effect. On appeal, he primarily challenged the constitutionality of the death sentences imposed upon him. He also assigned error to the dismissal of non-death qualified jurors and the consolidation of the cases for trial. The court held that: (1) defendant had a constitutional right to plead not guilty, and the Federal Constitution did not permit the establishment of a death penalty applicable only to those defendants who asserted their constitutional right to contest their guilt before a jury; (2) therefore, the language of &sect; 15-162.1 was unconstitutional; (3) accordingly, the death sentences in defendant's cases could not be carried out; (4) veniremen irreparably committed to voting against the death penalty regardless of the facts and circumstances were properly dismissed; and (5) since defendant was charged with crimes of the same class, close in time and place, and not overly distinct, consolidation was authorized in the discretion of the trial court by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-152.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgments, insofar as they imposed the death penalty, and remanded the cause to the trial court with directions, inter alia, to impose a life sentence in each case against defendant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Identical indictments were returned against the three appellants, each charging that the defendant named therein on December 17, 1970, &quot;did unlawfully, wilfully, feloniously and forcibly kidnap Mrs. Paul Richardson, without lawful authority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon determinations of indigency, the Public Defender for the Eighteenth Judicial District, Wallace C. Harrelson, Esq., was appointed as counsel for each defendant on January 26, 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to trial, the State moved to amend the indictments to charge commission of the crime on December 10, 1970, instead of December 17, 1970.  The motion was denied.  Defense counsel assured the court that he was fully advised that the State contended the crime charged was committed on December 10, 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants' pretrial motions for continuance and for change of venue were overruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each defendant entered a plea of not guilty.  On motion of the State, and without objection by defense counsel, the three indictments&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were consolidated for trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered the testimony, respectively, of J. A. Ledbetter, High Point Police Officer; Mrs. Paul Richardson, employee of North Carolina National Bank; Gary Anderson, High Point Police Officer; Mrs. Ina Ray Gray, employee of North Carolina National Bank; J. G. Nixon, Greensboro Police Officer; and Frank Fairchild, FBI agent.  Defendants offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence, summarized except when quoted, is narrated below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 4:40 p.m. on December 10, 1970, three men entered the College Village branch of the North Carolina National Bank in High Point, where Mrs. Paul Richardson and Mrs. Ina Ray Gray worked as tellers.  Everyone in the bank was ordered to get down on the floor.  One of the men came behind the tellers' cages and, holding a gun at Mrs. Richardson's head, commanded her to empty into a pillowcase the money located at her window and Mrs. Gray's window.  Mrs. Gray was made to get the key to the bank vault.  Mrs. Richardson was dragged to the vault, all the while forced into a &quot;stooped&quot; position so that she could not look at the men, and made to fill the pillowcase with money from the vault.  A gun was fired once.  Mrs. Richardson&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was informed that &quot;she was going to be a hostage.&quot; One of the men asked her if she had a car.  She said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and was made to get her keys from her teller's window.  The four departed through the back door of the bank and got into Mrs. Richardson's Buick, with Mrs. Richardson at the driver's wheel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the lookout for &quot;a '66 beige Buick,&quot; Officers J. A. Ledbetter and Gary Anderson sighted Mrs. Richardson's Buick stopped in a line of traffic headed north on Centennial Street because confronted by the red light at the intersection of Centennial and N. C. Highway #68.  The police car pulled beside the Buick, Anderson driving and Ledbetter to his right.  Ledbetter observed defendants Cox and Gary in the rear of the car and defendant Ward in the front seat on the right.  Ledbetter and Anderson observed Cox sitting directly behind Mrs. Richardson with a pistol pointed to her head.  The Buick turned out of the line of traffic, went through a service station yard, and headed east on #68.  A quarter of a mile from the Centennial-#68 intersection, Cox crossed over from the back into the driver's seat, pushed Mrs. Richardson &quot;over to the middle of the seat and down,&quot; and took control of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  steering wheel, still holding his gun on Mrs. Richardson.  Closely pursued by the police vehicle, which had its siren and emergency light on, the Buick attained speeds as high as 115 m.p.h. on the thickly-trafficked road.  After four or five miles of this chase, Cox pulled to the side of the highway.  The officers stopped about two car lengths behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cox got out of the Buick on the driver's side, pulling Mrs. Richardson out with his left arm around her neck and his gun up to her head.  The police officers got out of their vehicle and Cox began shooting at them, using Mrs. Richardson as a shield.  Ledbetter and Anderson moved to the rear of their vehicle, and then Ledbetter crossed to the other side of the road.  Cox came to the front of the police car, removed the keys, and shot through the windshield and over the roof.  In the process of being dragged back and forth, Mrs. Richardson fell down on the ground.  By this time the other two defendants had gotten out of the righthand side of the Buick.  Several more police cars were arriving on the scene.  For the first time, Ledbetter and Anderson opened fire on the defendants.  The defendants ran into the woods, continuing to shoot back&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at the police officers, and successfully eluded the officers who gave chase.  A pillowcase &quot;full of money&quot; was found behind the driver's seat of the Buick, and more money was found in the woods nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 4:40 a.m. the next morning, December 11, 1970, when it was still dark, Officer J. G. Nixon was patroling in the vicinity of Meredith Drive in Greensboro.  Three persons were beside the road and one attempted to flag him down.  Nixon slammed on his brakes, turned his car around and went back.  He then observed the defendants running beside a wooded area near Interstate 40.  He got out, chased defendants a short distance, then went back to his patrol car to radio for help.  Another car with Officers Austin and Stephenson arrived.  The three officers went looking for the defendants.  They followed Interstate 40, then turned into the woods and spread out.  Nixon flashed on his flashlight and saw two of the defendants, lying face down.  Nixon called to Austin and ordered the two to lie still.  One of these defendants had a shotgun and came up on his knees.  Austin hit him and grabbed the gun.  Stephenson came over and grabbed the second defendant, and the two were handcuffed.  Then the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  officers began looking for the third defendant, and he was found 20 feet north across a fence, lying face down.  He got up and was handcuffed.  A .22 pistol was found in the leaves, and more than $ 7,000.00 bound in bank straps of the North Carolina National Bank was recovered in a black skirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the trial two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearings were held, one relating to the admissibility of certain testimony of Anderson and the other relating to the admissibility of certain testimony of FBI Agent Frank Fairchild.  Facts in connection with these hearings and the testimony of Fairchild will be stated in the opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found each defendant guilty of kidnapping; and, as to each, a judgment imposing a sentence of life imprisonment was pronounced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each defendant excepted and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants entered a bank to rob it. They forced a teller to fill a pillowcase with money from the bank's vault. Defendants took the teller as hostage and used her vehicle as the getaway car. The hostage managed to escape and defendants were later arrested and the stolen money recovered. Defendants asserted numerous assignments of error. On appeal, the court found that the admission of testimony by an FBI agent constituted their most serious assignment because of the State's failure to produce and offer in evidence at the voir dire hearing a written waiver by one defendant of his Miranda rights. However, defendants never requested that the State produce the waiver form. Evidence of defendants' guilty pleas of robbery of the bank in federal court was proper because evidence disclosing the commission by defendants of a crime other than the one charged was admissible when the two crimes were parts of the same transaction, and by reason thereof were so connected in point of time or circumstance that one could not be fully shown without proving the other. Errors, if any, in the admission of testimony were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Rouse, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, September 7, 1971 Session of Craven Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these criminal prosecutions, the defendant, Kenneth James Wright, was charged by bills of indictment with three felonies: (1) housebreaking, (2) crime against nature, and (3) rape.  The three indictments grew out of a single episode which occurred in the trailer home of Mr. and Mrs. Parks at No. 1 Jones Street, Greenfield Heights Trailer Park, Havelock, North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the State's evidence, Mrs. Parks, wife of a member of the Marine Corps, was at home alone on the morning of June 4, 1971.  At approximately 9:30 a.m. the defendant, also a member of the Marine Corps, appeared at the trailer door and requested permission to use the telephone.  When Mrs. Parks told him she did not have a telephone, he drew a knife and forced entrance into the trailer as charged in Indictment No. 1.  Before leaving he committed the acts charged by Indictments Nos. 2 and 3.  During the struggle, to protect herself, Mrs. Parks struck the defendant with a pair of scissors, inflicting a shallow stab wound in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the defendant left, Mrs. Parks reported to officers what had occurred. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officers broadcast an alert.  Shortly thereafter, the defendant appeared at the Marine Corps Base for treatment of a fresh stab wound in the chest.  The officers, having been alerted, took the defendant into custody for questioning about what had occurred in the trailer home.  Present at the interrogation were Marine Corps and State officers who gave the defendant the required warnings after which he signed a waiver of his rights, including the right to counsel, and signed a written confession admitting his implication in the offenses reported by Mrs. Parks.  Warrants were issued and a date fixed for the preliminary hearing.  The court on a showing of indigency appointed Mr. Kennedy W. Ward attorney to represent the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Parks, in company with her husband, attended the preliminary hearing.  However, before she entered the courtroom, her husband lifted her up so she could see through the window into the courtroom where a number of persons were standing.  She saw and recognized the defendant as her assailant.  She had never seen him before he appeared at the trailer.  Her view through the window was the first time she had seen him since.  The defendant was ordered held&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  without bond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial in superior court the defendant, through his court-appointed counsel, entered pleas of not guilty.  The prosecuting witness, Mrs. Parks, testified, identifying the defenddant and described what he had done in the trailer.  The State introduced an expert who testified that he had lifted finger and palm prints from articles in the Parks' residence.  By comparing them with the defendant's known prints, the witness found points of similarity sufficient in number to enable him to express the opinion that the lifted prints had been made by the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the State undertook to introduce in evidence the written confession, the defendant objected.  The court conducted a voir dire in the absence of the jury.  Mr. Charles Lee Atkinson of the Naval Investigative Section, testified that he and Special Agent James M. Wilson of the State Bureau of Investigation, conducted the interrogation.  He testified:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;After advising him of his rights, I asked him did he have any objections in signing a military suspect's acknowledgement and waiver of rights form signifying the fact that he did, in fact, understand his rights.  He indicated that he had no objections to it&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  and voluntarily signed his name to the military suspect's acknowledgement and waiver of rights form at 12:50 hours on 4 June 1971.  In regard to counsel, the statement says: 'I understand my rights as related to me and as set forth above.  With that understanding, I have decided that I do not desire to consult with either a civilian or a military lawyer at this time and I do not desire to have such a lawyer present during this interview.  I make this decision freely and voluntarily and it is made with no threats having been made or promises extended to me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant objected to the introduction of the confession on the ground it was obtained at a time when he, an indigent, was not represented by counsel.  The State, however, contended the defendant was not an indigent at the time of the interrogation and was not entitled to have counsel appointed to attend the interrogation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voir dire examination, in the absence of the jury, disclosed the following: On June 7, 1971, before the preliminary hearing, the defendant signed an affidavit alleging his indigency and requesting appointment of counsel.  His affidavit stated his monthly salary was $ 149.00; his only property was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a 1970 Mustang automobile on which payments of $ 56.00 per month were due; he owed debts of $ 4,000.00; and he had only $ 5.00 in cash.  The court found indigency and appointed Mr. Kennedy W. Ward as counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, when the State insisted the confession should be admitted, the trial judge called and examined the defendant.  He testified he was eighteen years of age and had been in the Marine Corps for eleven months.  His pay was $ 149.00 per month.  He had authorized the Marine Corps to deduct $ 37.50 per month for savings bonds to be sent to his mother in Ohio.  He had $ 5.00 when arrested.  He testified he owned an automobile on which $ 56.00 per month was due.  The value of his equity in it was not shown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant called his stepfather who testified that the defendant's mother had received two $ 25.00 bonds, each of which had cost $ 18.75.  They were payable to the son and his mother.  The defendant is one of twelve children.  The stepfather works as manager of a garage in Ohio at a salary of $ 9,000.00 per year.  The defendant's mother had worked as a maid at a hotel until six months ago when, &quot;She quit to look after the kids.&quot; The stepfather testified that in order to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  help the defendant employ a lawyer, he would have to borrow the money and, &quot;My family would have to do without.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the voir dire, the court found the defendant's pay to be $ 149.00 per month and that in six months he could have accumulated bonds of a value of $ 225.00.  There was no finding as to the defendant's indebtedness though he testified he had $ 5.00 and a 1970 Mustang on which payments of $ 56.00 were due each month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foregoing was the evidence with respect to the indigency of the defendant at the time of his interrogation.  Based thereon, the court found as a fact the defendant was not indigent.  &quot;14. That the defendant had adequate resources with which to employ counsel at the in-custody interrogation stage of the proceeding in this case.&quot; The court concluded: &quot;3. The defendant not being an indigent was not required to give a written waiver of counsel at the in-custody interrogation stage.&quot; The court ordered the confession admitted in evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having recited the evidence and the findings, we deem it fair to the trial judge to quote the explanation for his ruling which appears in the record of the case on appeal.  &quot;Court: I want to be frank; this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  question has not yet been to the Supreme Court.  Now, Mr. Solicitor, I will leave it up to you.  I want you to confer and think about it.  If I'm wrong, then you are the man that's got to try the case a second time.&quot; The court then admitted the confession in evidence over defendant's objection.  The jury returned verdicts of guilty in each of the three cases, recommending the punishment be imprisonment for life on the rape charge.  From judgments imposed on the verdicts, the defendant appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs instituted this action October 6, 1971, seeking to have declared void as violative of designated provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions a statute enacted June 21, 1971, by the General Assembly of North Carolina, entitled &quot;An Act Authorizing an Election in Mecklenburg County to Determine Whether Mixed Beverages May Be Sold By the Drink Under Rules and Regulations Promulgated By the County Board of Alcoholic Control,&quot; being Chapter 617 of the Session Laws of 1971.

The only evidence introduced at the hearing consisted of two affidavits of William B. A. Culp, Jr., Executive Secretary of the Mecklenburg County Board of Elections; the verified complaint; the joint affidavit of David P. Reule and Eldridge D. Lewis, &quot;citizens, taxpayers and qualified voters&quot; of Mecklenburg County; a certified copy of Chapter 617, Session Laws of 1971, the Mecklenburg Act; and a certified copy of Chapter 279, Session Laws of 1971, the Moore (County) Act.  The only pleading filed by any of the defendants was a motion dated October 20, 1971, by Mecklenburg County and by the members of the Mecklenburg County Board of Elections, pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rule 12(b) (6), that the action be dismissed on the ground the complaint failed &quot;to state a claim against these defendants upon which relief can be granted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provisions of the Mecklenburg Act are summarized (except when quoted) below. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Section 1 defines certain terms used in the Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 2 states the purpose is &quot;to control the consumption of alcoholic beverages in places other than private residences by licensing certain persons to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption upon their premises . . . .&quot; It contains declarations as to the position of Mecklenburg County in respect of its location, population, and status as a business, industrial, transportation, and communications center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 3 authorizes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">and directs</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Meckenburg County Board of Alcoholic Control &quot;to promulgate a comprehensive plan for the administration, sale and enforcement of mixed beverages by the drink in the County.&quot; It also provides that, after approval thereof by the Chairman of the State Board of Alcoholic Control, and prior to September 15, 1971, &quot;the Comprehensive Plan shall be adopted and filed with the Clerk of Superior Court in Mecklenburg County, and published in a newspaper with County-wide circulation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 4 provides that &quot;the Mecklenburg County Board of Elections shall submit to the voters of the County, as soon as practicable, the question of whether mixed beverages by the drink under the Comprehensive Plan adopted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the County Board of Alcoholic Control shall be permitted in the County.&quot; It also provides that &quot;[t]wo issues shall be submitted on one ballot,&quot; namely, (1) for or against &quot;mixed beverages by the drink and the Comprehensive Plan,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">and</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (2) for or against &quot;'brown-bagging' if the mixed beverages issue is passed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 5 provides that if the voters disapprove &quot;mixed beverages by the drink,&quot; nevertheless &quot;brown-bagging&quot; is to continue to be legal in the county.  If both issues are approved, &quot;no person . . . shall possess both a brown bag license and a mixed beverage license for the same premises at the same time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 6 provides that the Comprehensive Plan shall become operative sixty days from the date it is approved by the voters.  It further provides that the Comprehensive Plan &quot;shall not be changed by the County Board of Alcoholic Control,&quot; but also states that &quot;the Board shall have full authority to adopt additional or supplemental rules and regulations, with the approval of the Chairman of the State Board of Alcoholic Control, . . . to carry out the intent&quot; of the Act.  However, Section 19 provides that &quot;[t]he State Board of Alcoholic Control shall exercise no authority&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  over the County Board of Alcoholic Control in the exercise of its power and authority to adopt rules and regulations for carrying out the intent of this act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 7 provides that the County Board &quot;may&quot; grant mixed-beverage licenses only to persons operating the following types of establishments: (a) a Grade A restaurant &quot;with a seating capacity at tables for not less than 50 persons and whose gross receipts from the sale of full meals cooked, prepared and served on the premises and non-alcoholic beverages served on the premises shall . . . exceed its gross receipts from the sale of alcoholic beverages&quot;; (b) a hotel or motel with no fewer than 40 permanent bedrooms where food and beverage service is customarily provided in bedrooms and other private rooms by a restaurant, as above defined, located on the premises of and operated by such hotel or motel; (c) a private, non-profit social establishment (defined in section 1(d) to mean &quot;a corporation or association organized and operated solely for objects of a social, recreational, patriotic, or fraternal nature, with duly elected officers or directors, which requires an application for membership and a minimum ten-day waiting period&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to attain membership, with minimum dues or charges to members of ten dollars ($ 10.00) per quarter year, which maintains a current memberbership list with the names and addresses of all members in good standing, and which is the owner, lessee, or occupant of premises upon which it regularly maintains and operates a dining room for the sale to its club members, and their authorized guests, of full meals cooked, prepared and served on the premises, which dining room has at least 50 seats&quot;); and (d) an auditorium or convention center, served by a Grade A restaurant, with a seating capacity and receipts ratio as above delimited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mixed Beverage&quot; is defined in section 1(f) to mean &quot;a drink composed in whole or in part of alcoholic beverages having an alcoholic content of more than fourteen per centum (14%) by volume and served to an individual in a sealed miniature container which shall contain one and six-tenths ounces of alcoholic beverage.&quot; Section 1(f) further provides that &quot;the miniature container must be purchased and consumed on [the] premises licensed,&quot; that it must be &quot;served with seal unbroken to the individual purchaser,&quot; and that &quot;[t]he licensee shall mix the drink after&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the sealed miniature container has been served to the purchaser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 8 provides that the licensee shall be liable for any violation of the Act or for any violation of any regulation of the County Board promulgated under the Act committed by his employees on his premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 9 provides that mixed beverages may be sold and consumed on the licensed premises during the hours it is lawful to sell malt beverages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 10 requires all licensees to &quot;keep such records concerning the purchase of alcoholic beverages, the sale of mixed beverages, and the sale of full meals and non-alcoholic beverages, as may be prescribed by the [County] Board,&quot; which records are to be open for inspection by the County Board at all times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 11 directs the County Board to review annually the operations of each licensee &quot;to determine whether during the preceding license year the gross receipts from the sale of full meals and non-alcoholic beverages at such establishment were less than the gross receipts from the sale thereat of alcoholic beverages and mixed beverages.&quot; When such an improper ratio is revealed, the County Board is directed to revoke the offender's license, not to be issued&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  again for at least one year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 12 gives the County Board discretion to revoke or refuse to grant licenses for violations of the Act or the regulations of the County Board itself.  It is further given the discretion, in lieu of revocation, to impose a fine of fifty dollars to one thousand dollars for any violation of the Act or any of its own regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 13 prohibits numerous activities, among them: Selling to an intoxicated person, employing or selling to a person under twenty-one, consuming or allowing an employee to consume any alcoholic beverage while on duty, knowingly allowing immoral conduct on the premises, knowingly employing a convicted prostitute (or homosexual, panderer, gambler, habitual law violator, or user or peddler of narcotics), tampering with the contents of any bottle or container of alcoholic beverage, and (in the case of a social establishment) refusing &quot;to make available the current membership list to agents of the [County] Board upon request.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 14 provides that purchases of alcoholic beverages by licensees are to be made only from ABC stores located in Mecklenburg County, and only in one and six-tenths ounce containers with stickers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  showing that such purchases are made pursuant to the Act and that the tax imposed by section 15 has been paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 15 provides that each licensee shall pay an annual license fee proportionate to the number of seats located in the licensed establishment and, in addition, a tax of five dollars per gallon of alcoholic beverage.  The tax is to be collected by the Mecklenburg ABC stores and paid monthly into the General Fund of the County.  &quot;No city, town or other governmental unit&quot; is permitted to levy any &quot;license or privilege tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 16 provides that any licensee is subject to inspection by the County Board, the State Board, or &quot;any county or city law enforcement officers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 17 provides that any violation of the Act or of any County Board regulation is a misdemeanor punishable in the discretion of the court, except that upon conviction the court is directed to revoke the offender's license, not to be issued again within one year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 18 declares that the provisions of the Act are severable and that the invalidity of any one provision shall not affect valid provisions thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 19 provides that the Act &quot;shall not be construed as repealing or modifying&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any provision of Chapter 18 of the General Statutes or the authority of the State Board of Alcoholic Control relating to those beverages defined in G.S. 18-64 and G.S. 18-60, except to the extent necessary to implement the provisions of this act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 20 provides that the Act shall control in the event of conflict between its provisions and any existing laws and clauses of laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 21 provides that the Act shall become effective upon its ratification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undisputed facts incorporated in Judge McLean's findings include the folowing: On August 11, 1971, the Mecklenburg County Board of Alcoholic Control adopted a Comprehensive Plan, which was approved by the Chairman of the State Board, filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County and published in a newspaper with county-wide circulation in Mecklenburg County.  Thereafter, the Mecklenburg County Board of Elections set November 5, 1971, as the date for the election, and complied with all formalities incident to the conduct thereof.  In preparing and planning for the election to be held on November 5, 1971, the County Board of Elections had already spent from the public funds of Mecklenburg County the sum of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  $ 7,380.31; and, if the election were held on November 5, 1971, it would spend the further sum of $ 18,620.00 to defray the expenses thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Comprehensive Plan adopted August 11, 1971, by the Mecklenburg County Board of Alcoholic Control, is in evidence as Exhibit B of the complaint.  Its provisions consist largely of a repetition of the provisions of the Mecklenburg Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge McLean entered judgment which, after setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law, provided:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is Now Therefore, the Judgment of this Court:</SPAN></P>

Bradshaw, Jr., members of the Mecklenburg County Board of Elections, that this action be dismissed pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 1A-1, Rule 12(b) (6), of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure on the grounds that the complaint fails to state a claim against said defendants upon which relief can be granted, be and the same is hereby denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(b) That the application of plaintiff for an injunction prohibiting the defendants from holding and conducting the referendum election on November 5, 1971, be and the same is hereby denied. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;(c) That the following portion of Section 3 of Chapter 617 of the 1971 Session Laws, beginning after the word 'County' in line four (4), to wit: 'The Board shall have full authority, subject to and not in conflict with the provisions of this act, to adopt rules and regulations in the plan as to the qualifications of premises and persons to be licensed,' is unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(d) That Section 7(a) [wherein persons operating certain restaurants, hotels and motels, or social establishments, are described as permissible licensees] in its entirety is unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(e) That Section 7(b) [wherein persons operating certain auditoriums or convention centers are described as permissible licensees] is unconstitutional and void except as it applies to the operation of auditoriums or convention centers by municipal corporations or other governmental units.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(h) That that portion of Section 17 following the word 'court' on line six (6), reading as follows: 'If any licensee is convicted of the violation of any of the provisions of this act, or any of the rules or regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, the court in which such conviction occurs is empowered to, and shall immediately declare the license revoked, and notify the Board accordingly, and no license shall thereafter be granted to the same persons within a period of one (1) year from the date of the conviction,' is unconstitutional and void; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(i) That the Mecklenburg County Board of Alcoholic Control be and it is hereby permanently enjoined, barred and prohibited&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from issuing any permits or licenses to any natural person, corporation, partnership, or fraternal or patriotic organization whatsoever under the authority of or by virtue of the provisions contained in Chapter 617 of the Session Laws of 1971, except, however, it may so issue permits and licenses to a municipal corporation or other governmental unit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the county, board of electors, county board of alcohol control, state board of alcohol control, and attorney general, sought review of a decision by the Mecklenburg Superior Court (North Carolina), which held unconstitutional certain provisions of an act that permitted an election as to whether mixed drinks should have been sold in the county. Appellees, the citizens, taxpayers, and voters, sought to enjoin the election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The North Carolina General Assembly passed the Mecklenburg Act, which authorized an election in the county to determine whether mixed beverages could have been sold under the rules promulgated by the county board of alcohol control. Appellees brought an action in which they challenged the constitutionality of the act and sought to enjoin the election. Appellants sought enforcement of the act. The trial court held that certain provisions of the act violated the state constitution. Appellants sought review, and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the entire act was void and that the election held thereunder was a nullity. The court found that former N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 29 and present N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24 prohibited &quot;local&quot; statutes. A statute was local, the court explained, if it applied to fewer than all counties, and the affected counties did not rationally differ from the unaffected counties. The court held that Mecklenburg County did not rationally differ from other counties with regard to the serving of mixed beverages. The court also said that the serving of alcoholic beverages was &quot;trade&quot; within the meaning of &sect;&sect; 29 and 24.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part a decision that held partially unconstitutional an act challenged by appellees and sought to be enforced by appellants. The court held the entire act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indictment on which defendant was tried contained two counts: The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">first count</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> charged that defendant &quot;did unlawfully, wilfully, and feloniously have in his possession and under his control the narcotic drugs, Cannabis, commonly known as Marijuana, and D-Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, commonly known as LSD, in violation of Chapter 90, Section 88, of the General Statutes of North Carolina.&quot; The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">second count</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> charged that defendant &quot;did unlawfully, wilfully and feloniously dipense to one Neil Cooper, age 15, the narcotic drugs, Cannabis, commonly known as Marijuana, and D-Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, commonly known as LSD, in violation of Chapter 90, Section 88, of the General Statutes of North Carolina.&quot; Each count alleged that the criminal offense charged therein was committed on September 27, 1970.  Defendant entered pleas of not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On account of defendant's indigency, the court appointed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the public defender to represent him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only evidence was that offered by the State.  Summarized, except when quoted, it tends to show the facts narrated below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norman Neil Cooper (Neil) testified that on a Saturday, which he thought was September 27, 1970, but in fact was September 26, 1970, defendant drove him to defendant's apartment and gave him &quot;the drugs to sell for him.&quot; Specifically, defendant gave Neil &quot;LSD and Marijuana.&quot; Neil had first met defendant near the University of North Carolina at Greensboro campus in the early part of the summer, probably June.  Neil had been going to this area for some months and had been buying drugs and using them.  Drugs were &quot;rampant.&quot; Neil saw defendant several times afterward, usually in the same vicinity.  After arriving at defendant's apartment on the day in question, the two talked, and Neil voiced concern about getting caught.  However, defendant &quot;was always saying that if I did get caught, you know, that since I was a juvenile, I wouldn't get but eight years [months], and it wouldn't be that much of a sweat.&quot; Neil was not certain, but he believed the amount of marijuana defendant gave him was &quot;a half pound or a pound.&quot; He and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant &quot;bagged&quot; the marijuana at defendant's apartment in several cellophane bags.  Defendant gave him in addition, thirty &quot;tabs&quot; of LSD.  An arrangement was established by which Neil would receive a percentage of the take.  Neil did not recall discussing his age with defendant, but he thought he had mentioned to defendant that he went to Page High School.  Neil was born on November 23, 1954, and in September, 1970, he was 15 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of Tuesday, September 29, 1970, Neil was arrested at Page High School by Officer G.A. Cox of the Vice Division of the Greensboro Police Department.  On Officer Cox's request, the assistant principal called Neil out of his biology class, and Cox arrested Neil in the hallway.  Neil had called him fifteen minutes before.  Nevertheless, Neil seemed surprised and reached in his pocket.  Cox searched Neil's pocket and found four small pills.  Neil confessed that, in addition, he had some marijuana in his boot.  On the way to the police department Neil stated that he had more drugs at home.  They went to Neil's home and found LSD, hashish, and marijuana.  Altogether twelve &quot;packs&quot; of marijuana were found, ten at Neil's home, two in his boots. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cox found &quot;nine small yellowish pills&quot; in a paper in a pipe bowl in Neil's closet.  The four pills found in Neil's pocket were sent to the S.B.I. Crime Laboratory in Raleigh to be analyzed.  Cox testified that the four pills sent away and the other nine &quot;looked exactly alike.&quot; One bag of marijuana was also sent.  Cox compared this bag with the others not sent to Raleigh; he observed that they were wrapped alike and that they smelled &quot;just alike.&quot; Neil was afraid to tell from whom he got the narcotics, but two days after his arrest he sent word that he wanted to talk.  He stated that he had gotten the drugs from a person named Eddie, whom he described.  He also described where this person lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer J. D. Heffinger of the Vice Division of the Greensboro Police Department, accompanied by Officer Cox, went to defendant's apartment about noon on Monday, October 12, 1970.  He advised defendant of each of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights.  No questions were asked defendant &quot;at that time.&quot; However, defendant made several statements.  He said &quot;he knew we were coming down there . . . ever since he found out that a kid had been arrested for some stuff that he had gave him.&quot; Defendant stated to Heffinger&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that he had known &quot;this boy by the name of Neil&quot; for several months, that Neil &quot;looked to be about twenty years old instead of fifteen&quot; (this before any mention to defendant of Neil's age), and that &quot;he knew nothing of Neil selling drugs for him.&quot; Defendant stated to Heffinger that &quot;he started fooling with Marijuana while he was overseas serving in Vietnam&quot; and that &quot;after he was fired from his job here in Greensboro he had to make a living some way.&quot; Cox overheard defendant make these remarks to Heffinger, as he was investigating defendant's refrigerator, and he corroborated Heffinger's testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Robert D. Brewer, also of the Vice Division of the Greensboro Police Department, delivered the aforementioned bag of marijuana and four tablets of LSD to J. M. Dismukes, a chemist for the S.B.I. Crime Laboratory in Raleigh.  Dismukes was found to be an expert in the analysis of marijuana and LSD.  He testified that the sealed plastic bag contained &quot;green vegetable material&quot; which was, in his opinion, &quot;high quality Marijuana,&quot; according to microscopic and chemical examinations.  The four yellow tablets in the sealed yellow envelope, under chemical, ultraviolet, and chromatographic&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testing, were found to contain lysergic acid diethylamide.  On the stand Dismukes asserted that the cellophane packages that had not been sent to Raleigh appeared &quot;identical&quot; with the one that had been sent, &quot;being high quality manicured Marijuana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Cox was recalled to the stand to explain that his notation, &quot;7-29-70,&quot; on Exhibit 5 (LSD from Neil's pocket) and the same notation on Exhibit 2 (LSD found at Neil's home) were erroneous and should have been &quot;9-29-70.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State was permitted to reopen its case to recall Officer Heffinger.  He testified that on October 12, 1970, defendant stated that he was twenty-five years old and that his birthday was February 13, 1945.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence offered at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing conducted to determine the admissibility of testimony as to statements made by defendant on October 12, 1970, in defendant's apartment, will be set forth in the opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty as charged on each count.  The court pronounced judgments of imprisonment on the verdicts as follows: On the first count, two years; on the second count, ten years.  It was provided that the sentences run concurrently.  Defendant excepted and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Guilford Superior Court (North Carolina) convicted and sentenced defendant of unlawfully, wilfully, and feloniously having in his possession and under his control narcotic drugs, and of unlawfully, wilfully, and feloniously dispensing the narcotic drugs to a minor. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised numerous objections. The court rejected each claim, and affirmed the convictions. The court agreed that the lower court erred in permitting the state to amend the second count of the indictment. However, the court held that the original indictment, without amendment, sufficiently charged a crime and that defendant's age was not an element of the crime. The court also rejected defendant's claim that he was not advised by the indictment that he was to be tried for an offense punishable under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-111(c). The court found that the second count alleged explicitly the age of the minor to whom defendant delivered drugs, and that no allegation was required to notify defendant of his own age. The court also upheld the introduction of defendant's statements made to the officers executing a search warrant. The court held that defendant was not interrogated, and that his statements were spontaneous. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the lower court erred in failing to make an explicit finding as to whether he was under the influence of drugs when the statements were made, because the crucial fact was whether he knew what was occurring.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions of unlawfully, wilfully, and feloniously having in his possession and under his control narcotic drugs, and of unlawfully, wilfully, and feloniously dispensing the narcotic drugs to a minor.</SPAN></P>

App. 64, 180 S.E. 2d 434. This appeal was docketed and argued in the Supreme Court as No. 36 at the Fall Term 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Habeas corpus proceeding instituted by John J. Tew, Jr., an inmate of Dorothea Dix Hospital, one of the State's hospitals for persons acquitted of crime on account of mental illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 17 July 1965 Tew shot and killed his wife, Inez Suggs Tew.  In consequence he was indicted for first-degree murder and tried at the 30 August 1965 Session of the Superior Court of Harnett County, at which Judge Leo Carr presided.  The State offered plenary evidence that Tew was guilty of the capital crime with which he was charged.  His defense was that he was insane at the time his wife was killed.  The jury's verdict, returned 4 September 1965, was that &quot;the defendant is not guilty by reason of insanity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In accordance with G.S. 122-84 (1964), Judge Carr ordered Tew held pending an inquisition as to his mental condition, which was duly held on 17 September 1965.  After a plenary hearing Judge Carr found&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that Tew's mental condition &quot;is such as to render him dangerous to himself and more especially to other persons, and that his confinement for care, treatment and security demands that he be committed to the Dorothea Dix Hospital in Raleigh, North Carolina.&quot; He ordered Tew committed to the hospital &quot;for treatment and care&quot; pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 122-83 (1964), G.S. 122-84 (1964), and G.S. 122-86 (1964).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 17 September 1965 Tew has been continuously within the confines of Dorothea Dix Hospital.  So far as the record discloses, he first attempted to obtain his release in May 1969 in habeas corpus proceedings before Judge Hamilton Hobgood.  After a plenary hearing, Judge Hobgood ordered that Tew's confinement in the hospital continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 7 October 1970 Tew began this proceeding by applying to Judge C. W. Hall for a writ of habeas corpus.  In his petition he alleged, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that &quot;he is not now insane&quot; and his continued restraint in Dorothea Dix Hospital is illegal; that at the previous hearing before Judge Hobgood, Dr. R. L. Rollins, superintendent of Dorothea Dix Hospital, and Dr. Andrew L. Laczko, director of the hospital's forensic unit, gave testimony which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;was without foundations in fact&quot; and in conflict with &quot;the facts known and expressed previously&quot; by them; that &quot;certain pressures were brought upon Dr. Laczko by high officials of Dorothea Dix Hospital which caused him to testify differently from what he believed&quot; and from what he had &quot;solemnly indicated&quot; to Tew's attorneys he would say.  He prayed that a writ of habeas corpus be directed to Dr. R. L. Rollins and to Dr. Andrew L. Laczko, requiring them to bring him before Judge Hall in order that the legality of his restraint might be determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Hall issued the writ and heard the matter on 3 November 1970.  In his judgment, filed 5 November 1970, Judge Hall made findings of fact which, except when quoted, are summarized below (enumeration ours):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) Since February 1969 Tew has worked in the hospital supply room in the presence of both men and women and has shown no disposition to harm himself or anyone else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) His &quot;mental condition has considerably improved since his commitment,&quot; and drug treatment has been discontinued for over two years.  &quot;Recent psychiatric examinations by qualified experts reveal no evidence of any mental disorder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) &quot;Petitioner has now been restored&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to his right mind, is now sane, and his mental condition is not now such as to render him dangerous to himself or other persons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) &quot;Petitioner has had symptoms of paranoia, which are now in remission; and the Superintendent of Dorothea Dix Hospital does not recommend his unconditional release.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) &quot;The superintendents of the several State hospitals have not certified that they have examined the petitioner and found him to be sane, and that his detention is no longer necessary for his own safety or the safety of the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the foregoing findings, Judge Hall &quot;concluded&quot; that Tew &quot;is now sane and his detention is no longer necessary for his own safety or the safety of the public.&quot; Although he noted &quot;doubts as to the validity of the proviso of G.S. 122-86,&quot; he held that he was &quot;not authorized to discharge the petitioner until after the superintendents of the several State hospitals have certified that they have examined him and found him to be sane, and that his detention is no longer necessary for his own safety or the safety of the public.&quot; He thereupon remanded Tew to the custody of the Dorothea Dix Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tew excepted to Judge Hall's conclusion that he was not authorized&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to discharge him and to the order remanding him to Dorothea Dix Hospital.  His application to the Court of Appeals for a writ of certiorari was allowed and, in an opinion by Judge Campbell in which Judge Graham concurred, the Court of Appeals affirmed Judge Hall's judgment.  Judge Britt dissented, and Tew appealed under G.S. 7A-30(2).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate sought review of the decision of the COURT OF APPEALS OF NORTH CAROLINA, which affirmed the judgment of a trial court that while the inmate was now sane and his detention was no longer necessary for his own safety or the safety of others, the trial court was not authorized to discharge the inmate pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 122-86.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury found the inmate not guilty by reason of insanity in the killing of his wife. He was committed to a State mental hospital. Years later the inmate filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus. Although the trial court expressed doubts about the constitutionality of &sect; 122-86, it remanded the inmate to the custody of the State hospital. The sole issue was the validity of the last sentence of &sect; 122-86 that prohibited a judge ordering the discharge of the inmate after issuing a writ of habeas corpus until the superintendents of several State hospitals certified that they had examined the inmate and found him to be sane, and that his detention was not longer necessary for his own safety or the safety of the public. On appeal, the court held that the power of a court, in a proper case, to discharge a person acquitted of crime because of insanity could not be circumscribed. Such a condition would deprive the court of any exercise of judicial discretion and nullify its power to release a person being illegally detained in a mental hospital. Section 122-86 did not meet the requirements of due process. The absolute certification requirement of &sect; 122-86 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision of the intermediate appellate court, vacated the judgment of the trial court, and remanded the proceeding for a hearing de novo.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant under G.S. 7A-30(1) from the decision of the Court of Appeals reported in 12 N.C. App. 584, 184 S.E. 2d 386.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This criminal action was commenced in the District Court Division, Buncombe County, by a warrant based on an affidavit which alleged that, on or about December 13, 1970, defendant &quot;did unlawfully, wilfully, Operate as an employee of the Family Recreation Center, a licensee, at 85 Tunnel Road on Sunday The said family Recreation Center being a Billiard Hall consisting of 16 billiard tables in violation of City Ordance [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] Chapter 7 Section 7-7.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The portion of the ordinance referred to in the warrant is set out in the record as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sec. 7-7.  Operation Between Certain Hours and on Sunday Prohibited.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">It shall be unlawful for any billiard hall licensee or his employee to keep such billiard hall open or to operate the same between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 8:00 a.m., or at any time on Sunday.  (Code 1945, &sect; 185).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause came on for hearing before District Court Judge Winner on December 22, 1970, on defendant's (oral) motion to quash the warrant on the ground that it was based on an unconstitutional ordinance.  No evidence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was offered.  Briefs and oral arguments were submitted.  Judge Winner considered and answered four specific questions, presumably those raised by defendant as grounds for his motion to quash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answering Question I, Judge Winner held that the ordinance came within the provisions of G.S. 160-200(33) and that Asheville had &quot;the power to pass a constitutional ordinance in this area.&quot; Answering Question II, he held &quot;that the regulations of businesses, in the area [in which] they may operate, is within the police power vested in the states, and . . . the ordinance is not unconstitutional for that reason.&quot; Answering Question III, he held &quot;it is not a denial of freedom of religion to prohibit businesses from opening on Sunday and . . . this ordinance is not unconstitutional for that reason.&quot; Question IV and Judge Winner's answer thereto are quoted in full below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Question IV: Is the ordinance unconstitutional in that it is a denial of equal protection of the laws, as granted by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution? It has been held that statutes may be passed as long as they are not class legislation and are not made to apply arbitrarily to certain persons or classes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or to make unreasonable discrimination between persons or classes.  It is the opinion of the court that to make a distinction between billiard parlors and other forms of sporting activities for which one must pay a rental for the use of premises, is both unreasonable and arbitrary and it does create a discrimination between businesses of the same type or class with no apparent reason for the discrimination.  This court cannot find any reasonable distinction between the operation of billiard halls and the operation of bowling alleys, snooker parlors, golf courses or tennis courts.  In this day and time, there is nothing inherent in the playing of billiards, which distinguishes it from any of the above mentioned sports.  It is therefore the opinion of this court that the ordinance named does deny the defendant the equal protection of the laws, and it is therefore unconstitutional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holding the ordinance denied to defendant the equal protection of the laws, Judge Winner quashed the warrant and dismissed the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeal by the State from Judge Winner's judgment was heard at the January 25, 1971 Criminal Session of the Superior Court of Buncombe County by Ervin, J., who affirmed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Judge Winner's judgment.  On the State's appeal therefrom, Judge Ervin's judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals.  Defendant appeals to this Court as of right under G.S. 7A-30(1).  </SPAN></P>

The district court had held the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with operating a billiard hall on Sunday in violation of Asheville City Ordinances &sect; 7-7. Defendant successfully challenged the constitutionality of the statute, and was upheld on appeal to the superior court. The court of appeals reversed the superior court, however, and defendant appealed. The court reversed the court of appeals, affirming the right of the State to appeal but ruling that Asheville City Ordinances &sect; 7-7 denied defendant equal protection under the laws. The court acknowledged the city's police power under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-181 and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-174(a) to regulate billiard halls. The court explained, however, that operating a billiard hall on Sunday did not interfere with the peace and quiet differently from operating other sporting or recreational facilities, such as bowling alleys, dance halls, and skating rinks. Although the ordinance's objective of promoting the public health, safety, morals, and welfare by the establishment of a day of rest and relaxation was valid, the placement of billiard halls in a unique classification was not, the court said.</SPAN></P>

This case was docketed and argued at the Fall Term 1971 as No. 62.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proceeding originated on January 7, 1969, by petition signed by a majority of the landowners and qualified voters of a designated area in Jackson County requesting that the area be incorporated.  The described area is one mile long divided lengthwise by U. S. Highway 441.  The east and west boundaries are 675 feet from the center of the highway.  The northern boundary joins the Cherokee (Qualla) Indian Reservation.  Cherokee, the present Indian town, is within one mile of the northern boundary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the date the petition was filed the area contained sixty-two inhabitants, forty-two qualified voters, and twenty tracts of land valued at $ 436,870.00.  The petitioners requested that the area be incorporated as &quot;Cherokee Town.&quot; The petition was addressed to the Municipal Board of Control (Board) and filed with the Secretary of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board posted notice and held a hearing as required by Article 17, Chapter 160, Sections 195, 196, 197 and 198 of the General Statutes.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians intervened and filed objections to the proposed incorporation.  Among the objections were: (1) The area is within three miles of the Indian Town of Cherokee; (2) the purpose of the proposed incorporation is to exploit and to cash in on the Indian name and syphon off from the Indians the lucrative trade which they have fostered and built with the hundreds of thousands of visitors attracted to the area; (3) the new incorporation would deprive them of their present livelihood; and (4) the proposed incorporation would legalize the sale of and make available to the Indians harmful commodities and drinks which are illegal and forbidden on the Reservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interveners alleged they are qualified to protest the proposed incorporation by reason of the fact that they are an incorporated body created by Chapter 211, Private Laws of 1889, and by Chapter 166, Private Laws of 1895, with power to sue and defend actions in courts and before boards in which their rights are involved.  (See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">U.S. v. Wright</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 53 F. 2d 300, Certiorari denied 285 U.S. 539.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioners by amendment changed the proposed name substituting &quot;Indian Hills&quot; for &quot;Cherokee Town.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On March 19, 1969, the Municipal Board of Control, after hearing and findings, ordered the incorporation as prayed for in the petition.  The Indians obtained a review in the Superior Court of Jackson County on March 28, 1969.  Judge Bryson affirmed the order of incorporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals by decision filed June 24, 1970, 8 N.C. App. 564, 174 S.E. 2d 850, reversed Judge Bryson's order and remanded the cause for further findings of fact calling attention to the failure of the Board and of the Superior Court to make a finding that the proposed area was not within three miles of the &quot;limits of any city, town, or incorporated village.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 19, 1971, the Superior Court of Wake County found further facts and affirmed the order incorporating Indian Hills.  The interveners brought the case here for final review alleging the order of incorporation was invalid and that Chapter 1225, Session Laws of 1969, under which the Municipal Board of Control and the Superior Court purported to act, was unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants were tried upon separate bills of indictment, proper in form, charging them with the rape of Sandra K. Garner on 6 February 1971.  Defendant Barrett's motion for a separate trial was denied, and defendants were tried together over Barrett's objection.  Bass was adjudged indigent and was represented by the public defender.  Barrett was represented by privately employed counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that Sandra Garner, a sixteen-year-old high school girl, went to the Buckaroo Steak House on 6 February 1971 at 9:30 p.m. to pick up Cathy Edgerly, a girl friend who worked there.  Sandra was driving a black and white 1963 Plymouth Fury four-door sedan.  She parked it in front of the Steak House in a well-lighted area near the door.  She observed two young colored men standing nearby.  She had never seen them before but now knows them as Michael Bass and Gregory Alexander Barrett.  She entered the Steak House to let Cathy know she was there and waiting for her.  When she returned and entered her car, defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bass opened the right front passenger door, grabbed her hair, pulled her head down to the seat and struck her on the head.

She screamed and struggled to no avail.  As they traveled along Summit Avenue in Greensboro, she could see their faces under the street lights and recognized them as the same two young colored men she had seen before entering the Steak House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One defendant asked Sandra her name and where she went to school.  &quot;I gave him a fake name, and they got my driver's license out of my pocketbook and read my name and address and said they knew who I was and where I lived, and if they read anything about it in the paper or anything happened to either one of them, they knew who I was and where I lived and wouldn't be afraid to come after me and kill me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver, Barrett, turned left off Summit Avenue onto a dirt road.  Sandra was then pushed headfirst over the front seat into the rear seat and landed with her face against &quot;the back of the back seat.&quot; Bass followed her into the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  back seat, forcibly removed her boots, her panties and panty hose, and had intercourse with her by force and against her will.  Barrett stopped the car, opened the door and got into the back seat.  The dome light came on and Sandra again saw their faces and recognized them as the two young men she had seen earlier before she entered the steak house.  Bass stood outside the car by the right rear door, and Barrett had intercourse with Sandra by force and against her will.  Then Bass reentered the car and raped the girl a second time.  Then Barrett raped her a second time.  While this was taking place Bass got under the wheel and started driving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rear window of the car had fogged over and &quot;Bass told Barrett to get up and clear the back window so he could see if there was a police car behind us. . . .  Barrett raised up and cleared the back window with his hands so he could see if it was a police car behind us.  Then he said 'It might be a police car.  It doesn't have any lights.  Turn down this road, and if it follows us, we know it is.'&quot; When the car continued to follow them as they turned into various side streets, Bass said: &quot;Get ready because we are going to have to jump.&quot; Both&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  men then jumped from the car while it was still moving and ran away.  Bass was dressed in a green army jacket, a red T-shirt and was wearing boots.  Barrett had on a beige jacket.  Sandra could remember nothing else about their dress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peyton Murray, with his wife and daughter, had supper at the Buckaroo Steak House on 6 February 1971.  They finished eating about 9:30 p.m. and went to their car.  They saw two colored boys &quot;back up a little bit&quot; when they came out.  These young men were fifteen to twenty feet away.  The Murrays sat in their vehicle about five minutes and watched the two subjects peeping in the windows and staying in the dark behind some columns.  About 9:40 p.m. a girl came out and entered her car and the two boys rushed her, one on each side of her car.  &quot;The light skinned boy had that girl's head pounding her down on the seat.  I jumped out and hollered and cursed them.  And they just backed out like this and went up Summit Avenue.&quot; They were in a Plymouth with a white top and a dark bottom, license number BD-7521.  Mr. Murray went into the Steak House and told Cathy Edgerly to call the girl's father, as a result of which the police were also alerted.  One of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  assailants was wearing an army jacket with bright buttons, similar to State's Exhibit 4, the jacket Bass was wearing when arrested, but the Murrays were unable to identify defendants as the men they saw at the Steak House that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to a radio call about 10 p.m., Officer Simpson drove to the Buckaroo Steak House area looking for the black and white Plymouth bearing license number BD-7521.  He saw the car at approximately 10:40 p.m. in a line of traffic at a stop light at Market and Laurel Streets.  He followed the car and saw a Negro male wipe off the back glass.  The car then made various right and left turns along unpaved streets and alleys and was momentarily out of view when it rounded blind corners.  When the officer finally jumped from his car and ran to the slowly moving Plymouth near a dead-end alley, Sandra Garner was its only occupant.  She was crying and, except for a white sweater shirt, naked and said she had been raped.  She told the officer her assailants ran south toward the railroad tracks.  Officer Downs and Officer Hightower were patrolling in separate cars in the area, and each was alerted by radio about 10:40 p.m. Officer Downs left his car and went&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the railroad tracks where he saw two colored males running across the tracks.  He pursued them through a wooded area and into a clearing back of a churchyard.  Officer Hightower approached the railroad tracks in the opposite direction from Officer Downs and saw two Negro males running toward him.  He saw them run into the woods and then across a parking lot behind the church.  One disappeared in a patch of woods and the other ran toward Nocho Street where defendant Bass lived with his mother.  Officer Downs searched the area and found defendant Bass hiding in a Dempster Dumpster under the garbage and trash with only his eyes showing.  &quot;I told the man to get up.  He stood up and made the statement that I had nothing on him and no one could identify him. . . .  As he was getting out of the dumpster, I observed his belt was undone and his fly was partially unzipped.&quot; He had on a green army-type jacket and was wearing a blue sweat shirt with a red T-shirt underneath and military-type boots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers knew that Michael Bass and Gregory Barrett were friends and ran together.  When Bass was taken into custody an alert was put out for Barrett.  Officer McNair learned from Ronald Bass, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a brother of Michael Bass, that these defendants were together on the night in question and left the house together between 8 and 9 p.m. Gregory Barrett was duly arrested at 2:30 a.m. on February 8 in a room at the O'Henry Hotel where he lived.  State's Exhibit 5, a light beige jacket-type coat, was hanging on the closet door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following his arrest, defendant Bass was warned of his constitutional rights as required by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda v. Arizona</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 384 U.S. 436, and, with full knowledge and understanding of his right to counsel, orally waived such right and agreed to participate in a lineup without a lawyer present, saying he would call his lawyer in the morning.  Accordingly, around 3:30 a.m. on the morning of 7 February 1971, Sandra Garner viewed a lineup of seven Negro males including Bass and identified him as one of her assailants.  Defendant Barrett was never placed in a lineup following his arrest.  Sandra next saw him at the preliminary hearing.  She testified: &quot;I recognized him as soon as I came into the room.  He was sitting over on one side of the room against the wall.  Nobody prompted me or pointed him out in any way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandra Garner positively identified both defendants at the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  preliminary hearing and in court at the trial.  She testified that she based her in-court identification &quot;on the times I saw them the night it took place; outside the Buckaroo, and when I came out of the Buckaroo I saw them; in the car, and just the times I saw them that night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants duly objected to all in-court identification testimony, and a voir dire hearing was conducted prior to its admission.  The State and both defendants offered evidence on the voir dire following which the trial judge found as a fact: (1) That Bass was duly warned of his constitutional rights; (2) that Bass freely and voluntarily, knowingly and understandingly waived his right to counsel orally before going into the lineup and thereafter freely participated in it; (3) that the lineup consisted of seven Negro males, including Bass, and that at least two other participants were wearing army-type jackets or coats, green in color; (4) that Sandra Garner identified one of her assailants as the fourth man from the left in the lineup, and Bass was standing fourth from the left; (5) that no one prompted Sandra Garner or suggested to her in any way who Bass was or where he was standing in the lineup; (6) that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sandra had seen defendants Bass and Barrett about 9:30 p.m. on 6 February 1971 when she first went to the Buckaroo Steak House, and saw them again when she left her car and entered the Steak House, and saw them again when she left the Steak House and returned to her car, and saw their faces from time to time when they drove under street lights and when the dome light came on in the car; (7) that Sandra Garner's in-court identification of both defendants originated independently of the lineup; (8) that the pre-trial out-of-court identification procedures in which Bass participated were not so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification; (9) that Sandra recognized defendant Barrett at the preliminary hearing on 12 February 1971 as soon as she entered the courtroom and saw him seated in a group with other persons, including several Negro males, and there was no suggestiveness on the part of the officers or anyone else as to who Barrett was or where he was seated; (10) that her identification of Barrett was based on her observation of him as she entered and left the Buckaroo Steak House, and at the time he forced his way into her&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  car, and upon seeing him before and during the attack on her; (11) that her in-court identification of Barrett &quot;was independent of and untainted by outside influences and is based solely on her seeing Barrett before and during his attack on her and is of independent origin and not from any pre-trial confrontation&quot;; and (12) that her identification of Barrett at the preliminary hearing was not impermissibly suggestive so as to give rise to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification on her part.  The court thereupon concluded that her in-court identification of both defendants was competent.  Defendants' motions to suppress were thereupon denied, and the in-court identification of each defendant by Sandra Garner was admitted over objection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Bass did not testify and offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gregory Barrett testified in his own behalf.  His evidence tends to show that he attended a movie with his girl friend Brenda Brown on Saturday night, the 6th day of February 1971, arriving at the theater about 7:30 p.m. and leaving the theater about 9:30 p.m.; that he then sent his girl friend home on a bus and went to Michael Bass' house, arriving there &quot;about a quarter of ten&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to ten thirty&quot;; that Bass was not at home and he watched television until about 11 p.m. at the Bass residence; that he then called Brenda Brown and they rode a cab to the O'Henry Hotel, where they had been living together for about four months, and went to bed.  Barrett stated that he did not see Michael Bass at all on 6 February 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brenda Brown corroborated Barrett's testimony.  She testified they arrived at the theater at 7:30 p.m. on 6 February 1971, saw the movie completely through, and left at 9:30 p.m.; that she then rode a bus to her grandmother's home and Barrett left, saying he was going to Michael Bass' house; that Barrett telephoned her about 11 p.m. as a result of which she caught a cab, went to the Bass home, and she and Barrett watched Shock Theater on television until midnight or later and then rode a cab to the O'Henry Hotel where they retired for the night; that Michael Bass never came home during the time she was there.  She admitted on cross-examination that she gave a statement (S-10) to the police, written in her own handwriting and signed by her, that she and Barrett went to the theater at 5:30 p.m., got out about 7:30 p.m., and she caught a bus to Paulette&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Knox's house.  She asserted, however, that she had the time mixed up and the written statement was not true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Barrett offered other witnesses whose testimony tends, in some measure, to support his alibi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered rebuttal evidence which tended to show, among other things, that Brenda Brown gave the police a statement in her own handwriting that she and Gregory Barrett went to the Carolina Theater at 5:30 p.m. on 6 February 1971 and left about 7:30 p.m.; that she went to Paulette Knox's house and Gregory Barrett said he was going down to Michael Bass' house; and that upon receiving a phone call from Barrett around 11 p.m. she went to Michael Bass' house.  As a State's rebuttal witness, Paulette Knox testified that she went to Brenda Brown's home before noon on 6 February 1971 and took Brenda to her house and they stayed there together all that day; that &quot;[a]fter dark, we left my house and went to the Paradise Drive-In.  I don't know what time it was, but the two of us were together, and we got back between the hours of 11:00 or 11:30.&quot; Paulette Knox further testified that Brenda Brown had called her on numerous occasions, including the day of the trial, and urged&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her to change her testimony.  &quot;She told me to tell the court it was on a Friday, but it wasn't.  It was on a Saturday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury convicted both defendants of rape and recommended life imprisonment.  Judgment was pronounced accordingly and defendants appealed, assigning errors noted in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed the judgment of the Guilford Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted both of them of rape. Defendants had been tried upon separate bills of indictment, proper in form. The motion brought by one of defendants for a separate trial was denied, and defendants were tried together over one of the defendant's objection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state's evidence tended to show that defendants forced their way into the 16-year old victim's car and repeatedly raped her. The police who found defendants immediately after the attack and arrested them. One of the defendants waived his right to counsel and participated in a lineup in which the victim identified him. The victim identified both defendants at a pre-trial hearing. After being convicted of rape, defendants appealed. The court upheld the verdicts. The court held that there was no reasonable possibility that evidence of the lineup identification of one of the defendants had contributed to his conviction because the victim had had ample opportunity to observe defendants during the abduction and attack. The testimony as to one of the defendant's clothing was properly admitted because it was relevant to the question of identity. The trial was properly consolidated given the presence of identical crimes that were very closely connected in time and place. The victim was properly allowed to testify that she had identified one of defendants at a preliminary hearing because there was no evidence of impermissible suggestiveness in the identification procedure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found no error in the trial court's judgment convicting both defendants of rape and therefore upheld the convictions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was tried at the 24 November 1969 Session of Gaston upon an indictment which charged that, in violation of G.S. 14-189.1, he purposely and unlawfully disseminated obscenity by selling and offering for sale certain specifically designated magazines and pictures, described as obscene in the words of the statutory definition of obscenity.  Before pleading defendant moved to quash the indictment on the ground, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that G.S. 14-189.1 is unconstitutional in that it violates the first amendment to the U. S. Constitution, the due process clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments, and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.  The motions to quash were overruled and defendant pled not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered evidence; defendant offered none.  The verdict was guilty as charged.  With the consent of the solicitor and the defendant, prayer for judgment was continued until 25 June 1970, when a sentence of six months' imprisonment was imposed and suspended for two years upon defendant's compliance with certain conditions. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals.  In an opinion filed 28 April 1969 that court held that G.S. 14-189.1 was constitutional and that defendant had received a fair trial, free from prejudicial error.  Defendant, on the ground that substantial constitutional questions had been decided against him, appealed to this Court as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-189.1. While the case was pending on appeal, 1971 N.C. Sess. Laws 405 specifically repealed N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-189.1. No savings clause was provided. On appeal, the court held that the unqualified repeal of &sect; 14-189.1 rendered moot the question of its constitutionality, which defendant contested in the name of first amendment guarantees of freedom of speech and press. Because &sect; 14-189.1 was repealed while judgment was pending, no punishment could have been imposed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four defendants operate three book stores in the City of Raleigh.  Queen and Bryant operate the Adult Book Store at 208 S. Wilmington Street; Knoll operates the J &amp; J Book Store at 123 W. Martin Street; and Childs operates the J &amp; J Book Store at 107 Fayetteville Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 18 May 1971 defendants were arrested upon individual warrants issued from the District Court Division of the General Court of Justice in Wake County.  Knoll, Childs, and Queen were separately charged with unlawfully exhibiting obscene literature for the purpose of sale in violation of G.S. 14-189 (1969).  Bryant, Knoll, and Childs were each charged with unlawfully selling two or more specifically designated publications featuring sexual activities in violation of G.S. 14-189.1 (1969).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an incident to the arrest of defendants upon these warrants, police officers in the City of Raleigh seized approximately 1,450 magazines, films, pictures and other items of merchandise from the J &amp; J Book Store on Fayetteville Street; 1,755 such items from the Adult Book Store on Wilmington&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Street; and 790 similar items from the J &amp; J Book Store on W. Martin Street.  The inventory shows that a total of approximately 4,000 items were seized from the three stores.  Many of the items taken were duplicates; from ten to fourteen copies of some books were seized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 25 May 1971 a detective of the Raleigh Police Department swore out warrants in which he charged that in violation of G.S. 14-189.1 each defendant did, on 18 May 1972, unlawfully &quot;offer for sale obscenity&quot; as indicated by the &quot;inventory hereto attached.&quot; This inventory listed the items which the police had seized from the respective stores on 18 May 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 19 May 1971, the day following defendants' arrest and the seizure of the material from their stores, the solicitor of the Tenth District and the State's Attorney General filed with Judge Edward B. Clark, one of the judges presiding in the Superior Court of Wake County, a &quot;motion for injunction hearing.&quot; The motion stated that &quot;an adversary proceeding to determine preliminarily the obscenity of the materials held is necessary in order to afford the defendants due process in the further retention of the seized materials. . . .&quot; Judge Clark granted the motion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and conducted a hearing on 25 May 1971, at which both the State and defendants offered evidence, made oral arguments, and submitted written briefs.  Thereafter Judge Clark examined all the items seized in the three stores.  On 2 June 1971 he entered an order in which he found, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that the materials taken constituted &quot;substantially the entire inventories&quot; of the three stores; that the items on the list by which he had placed an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">X</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were obscene; that those he had marked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Return</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were not obscene.  Less than five percent of the items seized were marked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Return</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Clark held as a matter of law that the Superior Court had jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter; that the seizure of the materials from the stores &quot;was proper, lawful and not unconstitutional&quot;; that all items marked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">X</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were obscene and that those marked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Return</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were not.  Pending the trial of defendants upon the warrants charging them with the dissemination of obscenity, or further orders &quot;by a Court having jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter,&quot; he ordered the Raleigh Police Department to hold as evidence the items marked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">X</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  The items marked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Return</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he ordered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  delivered to the operator of the store from which they were taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants excepted to the findings of fact and conclusions of law and appealed to the Court of Appeals.  In an opinion filed 20 October 1971 that court dismissed the appeal upon the grounds that Judge Clark's Order Retaining Evidence was interlocutory and did not impair any substantial right of appellants; that the seizure of the defendants' merchandise was lawful and they had been afforded their constitutional rights by the adversary hearing which Judge Clark conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants appealed to this Court on the ground that a substantial constitutional question had been decided adversely against them.  At the same time they petitioned for certiorari under G.S. 7A-27(d) (1) (1969).  The Attorney General moved to dismiss the appeal and resisted the petition for certiorari.  On 9 December 1971 we denied the motion to dismiss and allowed certiorari.  </SPAN></P>

Many of the items taken were duplicates. The superior court order authorized the police department to hold as evidence the items that a judge had found obscene. On appeal, the court held that the superior court had no jurisdiction to make the order from which defendants appealed. Until defendants were tried and convicted in a district court and appealed to the superior court for a trial de novo, the superior court had no jurisdiction of the cases under N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McLean, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 13 April 1971 Session of Mecklenburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By indictments, proper in form, the defendant was charged with: (1) The murder of Carla Jean Underwood; (2) the kidnapping of Rose Collins; and (3) the armed robbery of Rose Collins.  The contention of the State was that the three offenses occurred on the same day and as part of a single course of action, upon which the defendant embarked with his companion and accomplice James Nathaniel Westbrook.  Westbrook was tried separately and earlier for the murder of Miss Underwood.  His conviction and sentence to death was affirmed in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">State v. Westbrook</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 279 N.C. 18, 181 S.E. 2d 572.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three charges against the present defendant were consolidated for trial.  The defendant entered a plea of not guilty to each charge.  The jury found him guilty of armed robbery, guilty of kidnapping and guilty of murder in the first degree, making no recommendation that the punishment for such murder be imprisonment for life.  Pursuant to the verdicts, the court sentenced the defendant to imprisonment for 30 years upon the charge of robbery and to imprisonment for life upon the charge of kidnapping, this sentence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to commence at the expiration of the sentence for armed robbery, and sentenced him to death upon the charge of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c11">Pre-Trial Hearing On Plea In Amnesty And Motion To Suppress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a plea in amnesty on the ground that he testified for the State during the trial of Westbrook.  He also, prior to trial, filed a motion to suppress evidence of in-custody statements made by him to interrogating police officers.  Prior to trial, the court conducted a full hearing upon the plea and the motion, at which the State offered the testimony of the police officers, who were cross-examined by the defendant.  At that hearing, the defendant testified in his own behalf and also called as his witnesses, among others, the former solicitor and the attorney employed as private prosecutor in the trial of Westbrook, who also appeared in that capacity in the trial of this defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that pre-trial hearing, the police officers, called as witnesses by the State, testified that, having been assigned to investigate the kidnapping of Mrs. Collins, they interrogated the defendant while he was under arrest in Cabarrus County upon an entirely separate charge of armed robbery&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  alleged to have been committed there.  The officers testified that, having first told the defendant they wished to talk to him about kidnapping, robbery and murder, which they told him was punishable by death, they read to the defendant the full Miranda warning, specifying in their testimony all of the elements of that warning.  Thereupon, the defendant signed a written waiver of his right to remain silent and of his right to counsel during the interview, the waiver having been read to him prior to his signing it.  The defendant was then 22 years of age and had completed the 11th grade in high school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the pre-trial hearing, the officers further testified that, four days prior to this interrogation, a bullet had been removed from the defendant's leg and the officers had received from the State Bureau of Investigation laboratory a report to the effect that this bullet had been fired from the same weapon used to fire the bullets removed from the body of Miss Underwood.  The officers then testified that the defendant gave them a statement as to his activities in company with Westbrook on the day in question, which statement was reduced to writing and signed by the defendant.  Following&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this statement, the warrants charging the three offenses were served on the defendant.  The next day he directed and accompanied the officers on a tour of the route followed by him and Westbrook during the events recounted in his statement.  This led to the place where Mrs. Collins was left by her assailants, bound and blindfolded, in a wooded area outside the city, and to another wooded place at which the body of Miss Underwood was discovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this pre-trial hearing, the defendant testified that he signed the waiver of his right to remain silent and of his right to counsel after the officers had advised him of his rights, which he told the officers he understood, and that his statement was made freely and voluntarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the pre-trial hearing, the former solicitor and the counsel for the private prosecution at the trial of Westbrook, called as witnesses for the defendant, testified that the defendant's then attorney approached them and informed them that the defendant wanted to testify at the trial of Westbrook, then in progress.  After they conferred with Frazier, in the presence of his then counsel and his parents, they called Frazier as a witness for the State in the Westbrook&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trial and he testified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frazier was then recalled to the stand at the pre-trial hearing.  He testified that his testimony in the trial of Westbrook was as the result of the advice of his then counsel; that the solicitor, in the conference preceding his testimony in the Westbrook case, told him that if he took the stand he was to tell the truth, which he did; and that: &quot;The testimony I gave in that trial was given freely and voluntarily.  Mr. Stack [Frazier's then counsel] convinced me to testify.  * * * I told the truth according to the statement I made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of the pre-trial hearing, the court entered its order denying the motion to suppress and denying the plea in amnesty.  The order contained full findings of fact, including findings that: Prior to the making of the statement to the interrogating officers, the defendant, having been advised of his rights, signed a written waiver of his right to counsel at the interrogation and of his right to make no statement; his statement to the interrogating officers was made freely, understandingly and voluntarily, without any promise, threat, reward or hope of reward; Mr. Warren Stack, counsel for Frazier at the time of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Westbrook trial, approached the solicitor during that trial and told him the defendant desired to testify therein on behalf of the State; at a conference arranged by the defendant's then counsel the defendant so advised the solicitor; the defendant's testimony at the trial of Westbrook was freely, voluntarily, knowingly and understandingly given, no promises or threats were made to the defendant by the solicitor or by the private prosecution counsel and no reward or hope of reward was given or held out to the defendant for his testimony; when the defendant was called to the stand as a witness in the trial of Westbrook, he was advised of his rights by his then counsel and by the presiding judge; and that the State was not put to an election of either prosecuting the defendant or receiving his testimony in the trial of Westbrook.  The court thereupon denied the motion to suppress the evidence and the plea in amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Trial; Evidence As To Kidnapping And Robbery Of Mrs. Collins</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Rose Collins testified that at 10:30 a.m. on 18 June 1970 she drove her Volkswagen into the parking area of the Tryon Mall Shopping Center in the City of Charlotte.  As she was getting out of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vehicle, two Negro men seized her and stuck a pistol in her ribs, telling her to be quiet or they would kill her.  She pretended to faint.  Thereupon, the men picked her up, put her on the floor of the back seat of her car, covered her head so that she could not see them, and drove the car out of the city into a wooded area near Highway 49.  There, they took from her $ 5.00, her watch, her wedding ring and other articles.  They removed her from the car, threw her, blindfolded, to the ground on top of a baby crib mattress which they had also taken from her car, tied her hands and feet, told her they were leaving an armed guard who would kill her if she moved and drove away in her automobile, leaving her lying in the woods, blindfolded and bound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finding that she was alone, Mrs. Collins managed to get to her feet, remove the blindfold and, hopping and falling, make her way slowly through the woods to the highway.  While in the edge of the woods, she noted a foreign-make car, or station wagon, go down the dirt road into the woods to the clearing where she had been left and return almost immediately at a high rate of speed.  She could not determine how many persons were in it or whether&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  they were white or Negro.  With a broken glass bottle she managed to cut the tape binding her feet and then made her way up an embankment to the highway.  She was picked up by a passing motorist and carried to the city.  Returning, thereafter, with police officers to the clearing in the woods, where she had been left by her assailants, she found her Volkswagen parked there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having been blindfolded by her assailants, Mrs. Collins was not able to identify the defendant as one of them, but testified that she could see their hands and both were Negroes, one with darker skin than the other.  Both of her assailants participated in taking her out of the car, tying her hands and feet and putting a gag in her mouth.  She knows of no occasion when either this defendant or Westbrook had been in her vehicle prior to this occurrence.  Frazier is &quot;a medium to dark skinned Negro,&quot; Westbrook darker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was approximately 3 p.m. when Mrs. Collins was picked up on the highway by the passing motorist.  Her hands were still bound behind her back with friction tape fastened so tightly as to cut down into her flesh.  She was also suffering from scratches, bruises, insect bites and poison ivy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The place&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  where Mrs. Collins was left by her assailants is reached by a little dirt road running down into and out of the woods in the form of a horseshoe.  The officers who accompanied Mrs. Collins back to this place found there her Volkswagen, her opened pocketbook, its scattered contents, the crib mattress and her shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fingerprints and a palm print, lifted by an expert from the interior of Mrs. Collins' Volkswagen, were identified by a fingerprint expert as identical with fingerprints and palm print taken from the defendant Frazier.  Fingerprints, identified by an expert as those of James Nathaniel Westbrook, were also lifted from the interior of the Collins vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Trial; Evidence As To Murder Of Miss Underwood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carla Jean Underwood, 17 years of age, was last seen alive by her mother at her home on the morning of 18 June 1970.  At approximately 3:45 p.m. that day, her mother learned she had disappeared.  At approximately 5 p.m. that day, her mother identified a burned Opel Cadet station wagon, which Miss Underwood used to travel to and from work and which employees of the City Fire Department had found burning on Cates Street in the City of Charlotte at approximately 3:45 o'clock&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that afternoon.  An investigator of the City Fire Department observed an odor of gasoline in the vehicle not attributable to leakage from the gasoline tank or the motor.  A small bottle nearby gave off a similar odor.  Miss Underwood's father, the registered owner of the vehicle, had not given this defendant or Westbrook permission to drive the vehicle or use it in any way.  He had never seen either of them prior to that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 21 June, a body, stipulated to be that of Miss Underwood, was found in a clump of trees near the parking lot of the Celanese Corporation.  The body, clothed, was partially covered with an old piece of carpet and two pieces of plywood.  The clothing and jewelry were identified as those of Miss Underwood.  There were five bullet wounds in the abdomen, one bullet having passed completely through the body.  The other four were removed from the body in the course of an autopsy.  Fastened to the left breast of the dress was a Belk's Department Store name plate bearing the name &quot;Underwood.&quot; The dress was &quot;bunched up under the arms&quot; of the deceased and one leg hung in the fork of a bush.  Properly identified photographs of the body, as it lay where found, disclosed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the face was mutilated by decomposition and maggots beyond recognition.  In the opinion of the medical expert who performed the autopsy, the cause of death was the five bullet wounds in the abdomen and the date of death was 18 June, the date of Miss Underwood's disappearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the opinion of witness Pearce, Special Agent of the State Bureau of Investigation, stipulated to be an expert in the field of firearms identification, the bullet removed from the front portion of the left thigh of the defendant Frazier, as above stated, was fired from the same weapon as were the bullets removed from the body of Miss Underwood, the weapon being a .22 caliber pistol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c11">Frazier's Statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant, Frazier, testified at the trial of Westbrook &quot;with no substantial deviations&quot; from the statement made by him to the interrogating officers under the above mentioned circumstances.  That statement, admitted in evidence pursuant to the court's ruling at the pre-trial hearing of the motion to suppress, was to the following effect:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frazier spent the night of 17 June with Westbrook.  On the morning of the 18th, they walked to the K-Mart on North Tryon Street.  After remaining there about&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an hour they went to the Woolco Shopping Center.  They were &quot;looking for a car.&quot; Observing a white Volkswagen parking, they went to it and Westbrook &quot;put a gun on&quot; the driver.  She fell as if she had fainted.  They took a baby crib out of the car and put the woman into the back seat portion with a spread over her.  Westbrook got in the back seat with her and Frazier drove the car out of the parking lot, out of the city and onto Highway 49.  Turning off onto a dirt road, they stopped &quot;in a little field next to some woods.&quot; Taking the woman out of the car, they put her down on a mattress and left her bound and blindfolded, telling her that they were leaving a man to watch her and that he had a gun and would shoot her if she moved.  Westbrook took a ring from the woman and they also got &quot;a few dollars.&quot; They left in the woman's car, Frazier driving, and returned to the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arriving at the South-Park Shopping Center, Frazier stopped the car and Westbrook got out, saying, &quot;I think I have got one.  Come around on the other side.&quot; Frazier looked back and saw a girl get into a light colored, small station wagon.  Westbrook ran up to her and got into the car.  Frazier heard one shot and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thereafter did not see the girl.  Westbrook backed the car out and signalled for Frazier to follow him, which Frazier did.  He followed Westbrook into the driveway &quot;of the big building and down a road to where some construction equipment, tractors and things, were parked.&quot; Frazier then got into the front seat of the station wagon.  The girl was lying across the seat.  Frazier lifted her head and laid her across his lap.  She was &quot;trying to say something.&quot; Then Westbrook shot her four more times and one of those bullets struck Frazier in the leg.  Westbrook then dragged the girl out of the car and down to the place where her body was found, placing a piece of wood over her.  They then drove away and left the girl's body there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following this, Frazier and Westbrook went back to the place where they had left the first woman [Mrs. Collins] bound and lying in the woods.  Finding she was not there, they abandoned her Volkswagen and returned to the city in the station wagon.  They went to Frazier's house.  Two or three hours later, Westbrook returned in the station wagon, saying that they must burn it because his fingerprints were all over it.  Thereupon, they drove the station wagon to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the place where it was ultimately located by the Fire Department, set it on fire and left it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant offered no evidence at his trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c11">Hearing On Motions After The Verdict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the verdict and prior to the entry of judgment, the defendant moved to set aside the verdict on the murder charge and for the entry of an order requiring the solicitor to arraign the defendant on the charge of second degree murder in accordance with an alleged agreement by the solicitor with the defendant so to do.  This motion was heard before McLean, J., on 23 April 1971.  Witnesses then called by the defendant included the solicitor, Mr. Allen Bailey, counsel for the private prosecution, Mr. Warren Stack, who was counsel for the defendant Frazier until he was relieved of that responsibility by order of the court subsequent to the trial of Westbrook and prior to the trial of Frazier, Mr. Ernest Delaney, who represented Westbrook at his trial, the defendant Frazier, his mother and his father.  At the request of the defendant, Judge McLean also dictated for the record his own recollection of discussions with the court by Mr. Stack and the solicitor prior to Frazier's arraignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the hearing upon this motion, which is made a part of the record on this appeal, discloses that, in a conference with the court by Mr. Stack and the solicitor, the court was advised that Mr. Stack believed his client would tender pleas of guilty of second degree murder, kidnapping and armed robbery and the court was also advised that such pleas would be acceptable to the State.  In order to determine whether such pleas should be accepted by the court, Judge McLean requested and was given a transcript of Frazier's testimony at the trial of Westbrook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transcript of Frazier's testimony at the Westbrook trial was introduced by the defendant at the hearing upon his motion and constitutes part of the record on this appeal, being designated &quot;Defendant's Exhibit 'Y' (Amnesty hearing).&quot; This transcript was not offered in evidence before the jury at the trial of this defendant.  Examination of it reveals that it fully supports the testimony at Frazier's trial by Police Officer Clark that there were &quot;no substantial deviations&quot; between Frazier's testimony at the Westbrook trial and the statement given by Frazier to the investigating officers, hereinabove discussed and summarized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Frazier was first arraigned on these charges, 9 March 1971, the first charge mentioned was that of kidnapping.  Mr. Stack, still Frazier's counsel at that time, entered a plea of guilty to that charge.  Thereupon, the court interrogated Frazier to determine whether such plea was voluntary and made understandingly.  In response to the court's inquiry, Frazier stated that he wanted a jury trial.  Thereupon, the court struck the plea of guilty to the charge of kidnapping and ordered the record to show that the defendant entered a plea of not guilty thereto.  Mr. Stack, thereupon, requested permission to withdraw as Frazier's counsel.  After a further conference between Frazier and Mr. Stack, it being determined that Frazier did not wish to enter a plea of guilty, Mr. Stack was permitted by the court to withdraw as Frazier's counsel and the court thereupon appointed Mrs. Bellar, who represented him at his trial and at the above mentioned pre-trial and post verdict hearings and upon appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transcript of the hearing upon this post verdict motion further discloses, there being no evidence to the contrary, that Frazier, through Mr. Stack, approached the solicitor and Mr. Bailey while&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***17]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the jury for the Westbrook trial was being selected and told them Frazier desired to testify for the State at that trial.  Prior to so doing, Mr. Stack had fully advised Frazier with reference to this step and had told him that the decision as to whether to testify or not was one for Frazier, himself, to make.  No inducements whatever were made to Frazier to get him so to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following his testimony, Frazier was advised by Mr. Stack that, in the latter's opinion, it would be advisable to consider the entry of pleas to the charges pending against him.  Thereupon, Mr. Stack conferred with the solicitor and Mr. Bailey and it was ascertained that the above mentioned pleas by Frazier would be acceptable to the prosecution.  At the time of the arraignment, Frazier repudiated such pleas and requested a jury trial, as above stated.  Frazier's mother testified that it was Frazier's own decision to testify against Westbrook, neither she nor Mr. Stack advising him to do so.  From Frazier's own testimony at this post verdict hearing, it appears that his decision to testify for the State at Westbrook's trial was due to his belief that Westbrook intended to put the entire blame upon Frazier. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***18]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the conclusion of this hearing, the motion to set aside the verdict was denied.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;No error.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Mecklenburg Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted him of first-degree murder, kidnapping, and armed robbery, allegedly occurring on the same day. An accomplice was tried separately. Defendant challenged denial of a motion to set aside the verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying a plea in amnesty. He asserted it that the State should have arraigned him for second degree murder only. He also contended that the trial court erred in denying a motion to quash the indictment for murder on the grounds that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17 was unconstitutional. He further claimed that there was prejudicial error in the consolidation for trial of the three charges against him. On review, the court disagreed and affirmed. It also found no error by the trial court in allowing challenges for cause by the State to prospective jurors who, on voir dire, stated that they were opposed to capital punishment. The court found nothing in the record to suggest that defendant was not guilty by reason of insanity or that he was unable by reason of insanity to go to trial. The indictment was sufficient in form to allege murder and support a conviction of murder in the first degree. Because there was no evidence of a lesser-included offense, it was not required that the trial court charge the jury on such an issue. There was no violation of any constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Bailey, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at 29 March 1971 Session of Cumberland Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in four separate bills of indictment, each proper in form, with the murder of James Earl Buckner, the rape of Gwen Davis, the kidnapping of James Earl Buckner, and the kidnapping of Gwen Davis.  The cases were consolidated for trial, and defendant entered a plea of not guilty to the charge contained in each indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the selection of the jury, defendant excepted to the action of the trial judge in allowing challenges for cause as to five of the veniremen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following is a summary of the evidence offered by the State:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gwen Davis testified that on 28 June 1970 she was fourteen years old.  When asked if she had seen Danny Chance on 29 June 1970, defendant's counsel objected and requested a voir dire hearing.  On voir dire, Gwen Davis testified to events which revealed that she was in the presence of defendant from about midnight on 28 June 1970 until about 5:30 a.m. on 29 June 1970; that during that time she was forcibly taken into an automobile driven by defendant, and for a period of about 35 to 45 minutes she sat in the front seat next to defendant; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that she later saw him on the 29th day of June at the Sheriff's office in a lineup consisting of defendant and three other white males of about the same height; she identified Danny Chance immediately without any suggestion from anyone, and that her identification was based on having seen him during the period from 12 o'clock on June 28th to the early morning hours of June 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louis Frye also testified in the absence of the jury and stated that on 29 June 1970 he was a deputy sheriff in Cumberland County, and that he saw defendant Chance at about 2:00 o'clock on 29 June; that before talking with him, he advised him of his &quot;rights,&quot; and that at that time defendant read and signed a form which acknowledged that he had received warnings as required by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda v. Arizona</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 384 U.S. 436, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 86 S. Ct. 1602.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still on voir dire, the witness related statements made by defendant.  He stated that defendant also signed a consent to allow search of his house and car.  Defendant offered no evidence on voir dire.  The trial judge thereupon found facts and concluded:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;That the search of the suspect Chance's car and home was in every respect valid, was not induced by any fear&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  of harm or hope of reward and that such statement as he gave to Detective Frye was purely voluntary and was given freely and voluntarily and understandingly and in full knowledge of his rights at a time when the defendant was not under the influence of alcohol or any other -- or had any other apparent mental abnormality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge also overruled both the objection as to the identification of defendant by the witness Davis and the objection to statements given to Mr. Frye by defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness Davis then returned to the stand and testified: that on 28 June 1970, at about 3:00 o'clock p.m., she and a friend went to Steve's Drive-In in Fayetteville and remained there until about 11:00 o'clock p.m., when she departed with James Earl Buckner, aged 23.  They drove directly to her home within a period of about eight to ten minutes.  Buckner stopped his car about 30 yards from the front of her house, and she and Buckner were leaning against the car facing the road, engaged in conversation.  At this point, a white 1961 or 1962 model Chevrolet station wagon, which was dented, rusty, and had one rear taillight broken out, passed, turned around and came back and parked behind Buckner's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  car.  Four men emerged from the car and surrounded the witness and Buckner.  These four men were Charles Wilcosky, David Sisneros, Andrew Strickland and the defendant Danny Chance.  She had never seen any of these men before that night.  Strickland pulled out a pistol, stuck it in Buckner's ribs, and told both Buckner and Gwen to get into the station wagon.  Buckner was forced into the back seat by Sisneros and Wilcosky, and she was placed in the front seat between the driver Chance and Strickland.  Chance drove the automobile out on old 301 into the country, and while he was driving Strickland put his left arm around her shoulder and began to kiss her on her face and lips while trying to penetrate her privates with his hand.  He forced her to remove her panties and handed the pistol to defendant Chance.  Chance put the pistol between his leg and her leg and she grabbed the pistol and threw it out of the window.  Strickland at that point struck her.  After driving several miles into the country, Chance drove the automobile into and snapped a cable stretched between two posts which blocked access to a &quot;two-rut&quot; road.  He continued down the road and stopped the automobile between two&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ponds, where Sisneros and Wilcosky took Buckner out of the automobile.  Chance got out of the automobile, and Strickland put her into the back seat, where he forced her to commit a crime against nature and then forcibly had intercourse with her.  She stated that she did not consent to any of these acts.  Strickland left the automobile and Chance got into the back seat and ripped off her remaining clothes.  He then forced her to commit a crime against nature with him and forced her against her will to have intercourse with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sisneros and Wilcosky, in turn, entered the car and forced her to commit sexual acts with each of them.  While Wilcosky, the last of the four to assault her, was in the back seat, the others returned to the car and Chance drove the car back through the broken cables, down a dirt road into a tobacco field.  There Strickland and Chance go into the back seat with her and further assaulted her.  Thereafter, her clothes were returned and somebody began to choke her.  The next thing she remembered was waking up in the sunshine lying on two small boards placed across a ditch.  She walked to a house belonging to Harold Eldridge, who carried her to her home in Fayetteville. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Her mother immediately called the Sheriff's office and Detective Frye answered the call.  Gwen showed Detective Frye the route taken the previous night, and they located the body of James Earl Buckner.  Later, at the courthouse, she identified a station wagon as the one used the night before, and identified as hers an earring which was shown to her by Major Kiser of the Fayetteville Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Frye of the Fayetteville Police Department then testified that in response to a call he went to the home of Gwen Davis on the morning of 29 June 1970.  He found her badly bruised about the face, neck and shoulders, and apparently in a daze.  She told him briefly what had happened, and he went to the place where Buckner's car was parked and observed tracks nearby made by &quot;mud-grip&quot; tires.  Gwen Davis was able, with great difficulty, to show him where she had been taken.  They found the road leading into the woods and he observed a snapped cable and a place where an automobile had left tracks made by &quot;mud grip&quot; tires.  They drove down the road to a point beyond two gravel pits, where he found a scarred pine tree, and observed that the grass around the base of the tree had been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;trampled down.&quot; He followed the drag mark into the bushes and discovered the dead body of a man which Gwen Davis identified as the body of James Earl Buckner.  Buckner's hands were tied together and his face and neck were badly bruised and swollen.  (Detective Frye used photographs of the body to illustrate his testimony at this point.) Frye and Gwen Davis returned to Fayetteville to look for the station wagon in which she had been abducted.  He had broadcast a description of the station wagon earlier in the day, and when they returned to Fayetteville they found a station wagon matching the description given him by Gwen Davis parked behind the court-house.  He went into the Sheriff's office and there found Major Kiser of the Sheriff's Department and Danny Chance.  Chance consented to a search of the car, and Major Kiser found an earring in the back seat which was identified by Gwen Davis as one belonging to her which she had worn on the previous night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frye testified concerning certain questions asked by defendant and statements made by him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Sisneros testified that he and Charles Wilcosky were members of the U. S. Army, stationed at Fort Bragg.  He knew Strickland prior to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  28 June 1970, but had never seen Chance until that evening.  The four men met at the Drop Zone Club in Fayetteville and drank together until about midnight, at which time they bought a case of beer and rode around in Chance's automobile drinking the beer.  It was at Strickland's suggestion that they stopped and abducted Gwen Davis and Buckner.  He testified that Chance drove the station wagon into the woods and stopped, and that he and Wilcosky forced Buckner out of the back seat.  Chance suggested that they tie Buckner to a tree and gave Sisneros a piece of rope.  After tying Buckner to the tree, Chance, Sisneros and Wilcosky stood around for Strickland to get out of the car.  They observed Strickland having intercourse with Gwen Davis in the back of the station wagon.  Chance then entered the car and Strickland went over to the tree where Buckner was tied.  Strickland tied Buckner tightly to the tree, winding the rope around his neck.  Chance got out of the car and Sisneros got into it, and had sexual relations with Gwen Davis.  When Sisneros got out of the car, Buckner was no longer tied to the tree.  He did not see Buckner anywhere.  After refreshing his memory from a written statement, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  handed him by the Solicitor, Sisneros stated that Strickland or Chance told him they had killed Buckner and put him in the bushes.  Sisneros did not remember which of the two made the statement.  After that, Sisneros, Strickland and Chance got in the car, and Chance drove to a tobacco field and parked.  When Wilcosky got out of the back seat, Chance and Strickland got in the back seat and again assaulted Gwen Davis.  Someone gave Gwen Davis her clothes and as she was dressing, Strickland told Sisneros and Wilcosky, &quot;We have already killed the guy, and it's your chance to kill the girl.&quot; Wilcosky and Sisneros did not kill the girl and Strickland reached back and hit her in the throat and proceeded to choke her until she passed out.  Chance, Sisneros and Wilcosky placed her on Strickland's shoulder and he headed into the woods.  At one point, when she appeared to regain consciousness, Strickland dropped her on her head and stated that he thought her neck was broken.  Chance asked if Gwen were dead, and thereupon walked up and &quot;stomped on her neck . . . for 30 to 45 seconds.&quot; Strickland put his weight on Chance's shoulders and &quot;Chance stood on Gwen Davis' throat no more than ten or fifteen&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  seconds.&quot; Gwen did not move, and they put her in some bushes and left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered medical testimony showing that Gwen Davis had been badly bruised around the head and shoulders and that she was bruised around the pelvic area; her female organ had been penetrated by a male organ.  The pathologist who performed an autopsy on Buckner stated that he had died of ligature strangulation, and that he had been badly beaten around the head, neck, shoulders, arms and groin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant offered testimony of an acquaintance and a minister to the effect that he bore a good reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty to the charge of rape with no recommendation, a verdict of guilty of murder with recommendation of life imprisonment, a verdict of guilty of kidnapping James Earl Buckner and a verdict of guilty of kidnapping Gwen Davis.  On the rape charge Judge Bailey pronounced the mandatory sentence of death by asphyxiation.  On the murder charge he pronounced a sentence of life imprisonment, and on the verdict of guilty of kidnapping James Buckner a sentence of 99 years in prison, and on the verdict of kidnapping Gwen Davis, a sentence of 99 years in prison.  It was adjudged that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  death sentence be first imposed and that the other sentences run consecutively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant gave notice of appeal in open court, and the court appointed Sol G. Cherry, the Public Defender, to represent defendant on his appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Cumberland Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted him of murder, rape, and kidnapping, in consolidated actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the jury's selection violated his rights and that the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence photographs of a deceased victim because they were inflammatory and served no useful purpose. He also raised issue with respect to an interrogation and taking of statements. On review, the court found no error warranting reversal of the convictions. The court found no evidence in the record of any interrogation or any other procedure that violated Miranda. It appeared in this record that defendant wanted to make a full confession and that the police officer declined to take it. Thus, questions posed by defendant and the statements made by defendant were volunteered and, under the circumstances, there was no in-custody interrogation. The court also found no impropriety in the jury selection or in the introduction of the photographs. The court noted that the trial court could ask prospective jurors about their position on imposing capital punishment. The photographs were admissible because they were relevant and material to the charges, even if gruesome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c1"><SPAN CLASS="c4">December 15, 1971, Filed </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Blount, S.J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 12 April 1971 Session of Alamance, heard prior to determination by the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff is the holder of a Class G certificate authorizing him to teach in the public schools of North Carolina.  At the time he brought this action, 23 February 1971, he was employed as teacher of History and Assistant Principal of Walter Williams High School in the Burlington Administrative Unit.  He sued, on behalf of himself and all other classroom teachers in the State, for a judgment declaring the invalidity of the rules and regulations of the State Board of Education, which require a teachers' certificate to be renewed each five years by one of several specified alternative procedures, and which require certain deductions in the salary of a teacher who continues to teach without such certificate renewal.  In substance, the complaint alleges (numbering ours):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The plaintiff holds the above mentioned certificate and is employed as such teacher and assistant principal.  The defendants occupy the positions indicated in the caption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. G.S. 115-152 requires all teachers, and other members of the professional personnel, employed in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the public schools to hold certificates issued in accordance with the law.  G.S. 115-155 makes it unlawful for any city or county board of education to employ or keep in service any teacher, or other member of the professional school personnel, not holding a certificate in compliance with the provisions of law and forbids the payment of salary to one employed in violation of such statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The State Board of Education, at a regular meeting and pursuant to proper vote, adopted rules and regulations pertaining to certification of teachers, which rules and regulations, now in force, are attached to and made part of the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Such rules and regulations provide that all certificates issued to teachers expire after five years, unless sooner renewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The rules and regulations require for such renewal the earning of six units of credit during the five year period immediately preceding such renewal.  Such credit may be obtained in ways prescribed, including the completion of further college courses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The rules and regulations provide for a salary penalty of $ 20.00 per school month to be imposed upon any teacher continuing to teach while holding an expired certificate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  7. The City Board of Education has adopted rules and regulations governing the renewal of teachers' certificates, pursuant to authorization contained in the rules so adopted by the State Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. To obtain a renewal of his certificate, a teacher must, at his own expense, earn the credit units required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Employees of the State Board, stationed at its Raleigh Office, are not required to obtain further education as a condition precedent to the retention of their employment.  Likewise, superintendents of administrative school units, who do not obtain renewal of their certificates, are not subject to deductions from their salaries on that account.  However, all teachers, irrespective of age, teaching experience or previous education, are required so to renew their certificates each five years.  Thus, the plaintiff, whose Class G certificate shows that he holds a master's degree and who has been teaching continuously in the public schools of North Carolina since 1953, will, under the rules and regulations, be barred from, or penalized for, teaching subsequent to the expiration date of his certificate unless he obtains a renewal in the manner prescribed, whereas an inexperienced, recent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  graduate, holding a bachelor's degree and a Class A certificate, may teach the same courses without penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The plaintiff cannot obtain the necessary credits for renewal of his certificate except at his own expense, including the loss of summer employment, which has been offered to him for the summer of 1971 and from which his earnings would be $ 2,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. If the plaintiff does not earn such units of credit, the defendant State Board of Education will refuse to renew or extend his certificate and the defendants will either refuse to permit him to teach or will subtract $ 20.00 per month from his salary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Such threatened action of the defendants is unlawful and in excess of their authority for the reason that there is no statutory authority for the adoption of a regulation requiring teachers to undergo, at their own expense, further education as a condition precedent to the continuing validity of their contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. Even if there were statutory authority for the adoption of such rules and regulations, the said proposed action of the defendants is unlawful and beyond their authority for the reason that such act of the General Assembly contravenes Article I, &sect; 6, and Article&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  II, &sect; 1, of the Constitution of North Carolina because of the absence therefrom of legislative standards.  Furthermore, such proposed action by the defendants would, in that event, be in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and of Article I, &sect; 19, of the State Constitution in that such statute discriminates against school teachers in favor of other professions, discriminates against classroom teachers in favor of employees in a school which does not have a locally organized program (as authorized in the rules and regulations of the State Board of Education) in favor of teachers in a school which does have such program.  The proposed action of the defendants would, in that event, be unlawful because in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and of Article I, &sect; 19, of the Constitution of North Carolina in that school teachers are thereby deprived of a livelihood and of property without serving any reasonable end or public purpose, the said rules and regulations being arbitrary and unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants filed answer denying no material allegation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of fact and moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  The plaintiff, thereupon, moved for judgment on the pleadings.  At the hearing upon these motions, counsel for all parties agreed that there is no substantial controversy as to the facts.  Thereupon, the court entered judgment, setting forth its findings of fact and conclusions of law, denying the plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings and granting the defendants' motion for dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  The court's findings of fact, material to this appeal, are as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;1. That the plaintiff is a citizen and resident of Alamance County, North Carolina, and teaches history in, and is assistant principal of, Walter Williams High School in the Burlington administrative school unit.  * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;4. That the plaintiff now has a masters degree and has been issued a Class G certificate by the State Board of Education which under the rules and regulations of the State Board of Education * * * is scheduled to expire before the beginning of the fall term at the Burlington City Schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;5. That under the rules and regulations of the State Board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  of Education referred to above, the plaintiff must have six units of credit in order to have his certificate renewed.  * * * That under the present circumstances, plaintiff will be forced to obtain college course credit sometime before the start of the fall term of the Burlington City Schools in order to obtain the four units he now lacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;6. That the plaintiff has been offered summer employment which will offer him earnings of one thousand dollars ($ 1,000) a month and that in order to satisfy the certificate renewal requirements of the State Board of Education he will be forced to forego such employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;7. That if plaintiff does not acquire such four units of credit the defendant, State Board of Education, will refuse to issue a renewal certificate or extend the plaintiff's present certificate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;8. That if the plaintiff fails to receive a renewal certificate he will be subject either to a penalty of twenty dollars ($ 20.00) a month deducted from his salary as a teacher * * * or may be disqualified from teaching in the public schools of North Carolina in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 115-155.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;9. * * * That said rules and regulations have been duly adopted by the State&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  Board of Education and provide that the renewal requirements may be satisfied in four ways: * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon these findings of fact the trial court made the following conclusions of law:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;1. That in adopting the rules and regulations pertaining to renewal of teachers' certificates, the State Board of Education acted legally within the authority vested in it by Article 9, Sec. 9 of the North Carolina Constitution and by G.S. 115-153 that said rules and regulations in no way exceed the lawful authority of the State Board of Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;2. That the authority vested in the State Board of Education to formulate such rules and regulations is constitutional and lawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;3. That the rules and regulations of the State Board of Education pertaining to renewal of teachers' certificates comport with the requirements of equal protection of both the North Carolina and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;4. That such rules and regulations are in compliance with the requirements of the due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and of Article I, Sec. 19 of the North Carolina Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;5. That such rules and regulations of the State Board of Education are&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff assigns as error each of the foregoing conclusions of law.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff teacher challenged the judgment of a North Carolina trial court, which granted the motion for dismissal of defendants, state board of education, state board of education members, city board of education, and attorney general, in the teacher's action for a judgment declaring invalid the state board of education's regulation requiring renewal of a teacher's certificate every five years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teacher argued that the teacher certification regulation was in excess of the authority delegated to the state board of education by the General Assembly, violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the state and federal constitutions, and violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Law of the Land Clause of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The trial court dismissed the teacher's action. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Promulgation and administration of the regulation fell within authority conferred upon the state board of education by the Constitution of North Carolina. The requirement in question did not deny the teacher equal protection of the law because there was an obvious and reasonable basis for making the rule applicable to those who taught and omitting from its applicability those who did not. There was no basis for holding that application to the teacher and others similarly situated of the regulation adopted by the state board of education was a violation of the Due Process Clause or of the Law of the Land Clause because the regulation could not be deemed unreasonable or arbitrary in relation to the objective of improved instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which granted the motion for dismissal of the state board of education, state board of education members, city board of education, and attorney general in the teacher's action for a judgment declaring the state board of education's teacher certification regulation invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to review the decision of the Court of Appeals (reported in 10 N.C. App. 562, 179 S.E. 2d 788) affirming the judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Canaday, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, entered at the 22 June 1970 Criminal Session of Durham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding instituted by Junior Jernigan, a person imprisoned in the penitentiary.  Petitioner, purporting to act under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (G.S. 15-217 through G.S. 15-222), petitioned the Superior Court of Durham County to reverse an order of the Board of Paroles directing that the sentences under which he is presently confined in the State Prison System be served consecutively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts are not in dispute.  In 1959 and 1960 petitioner was convicted of various felonies and received prison sentences totaling over fifteen years.  He was paroled 5 October 1966 and was on parole on 11 March 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the April 1967 Criminal Session of Durham, petitioner was convicted of larceny from the person, which allegedly occurred on 11 March 1967.  On 6 April 1967, the presiding judge, the Honorable Leo Carr, sentenced petitioner to a term of ten years.  The judgment made no reference to his prior sentences and, on 7 April 1967, petitioner was committed to Central Prison&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to begin serving the ten-year sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 10 April 1967, under the authority of G.S. 148-61.1, the Board of Paroles revoked petitioner's parole of 5 October 1966, and, under G.S. 148-62, directed that he serve the remainder of the sentences upon which his parole had been revoked after the completion of the ten-year-sentence imposed by Judge Carr on 6 April 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1970 petitioner, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">in propria persona</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, instituted this proceeding by filing a petition in which he sought, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to present the question whether his ten-year-sentence for the offense of larceny from the person should run concurrently with the remainder of the sentences upon which his parole had been revoked.  Upon his application for counsel Judge Canaday adjudged him to be an indigent and appointed Mr. James B. Craven III, attorney-at-law, to represent him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing before Judge Canaday on 26 June 1970 petitioner stipulated that he was not asserting any error or denial of constitutional rights in the trials which resulted in the sentences against him; that the only issue he raises is whether the sentence imposed by Judge Carr should run concurrently with the unserved portions of the sentences&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon which parole had been revoked.  Petitioner attacked the validity of G.S. 148-62 and argued that the Board of Paroles lacked authority to order the sentences served consecutively.  Judge Canaday ruled the statute valid and &quot;explicit&quot; in this case.  He denied petitioner &quot;any relief in this situation&quot; and ordered him returned to the custody of the Department of Correction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals granted petitioner's application for certiorari.  It held that G.S. 148-62 did not contravene the Constitution of North Carolina and affirmed Judge Canaday's judgment.  We allowed certiorari.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">James, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 30 November 1970 Special Criminal Session of Pitt Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Doss was tried and convicted, on an indictment proper in form, of murder in the first degree of William Raymond Pierce, the jury making no recommendation that he be sentenced to life imprisonment.  Defendant appeals from a judgment imposing the sentence of death by asphyxiation pursuant to the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State offered evidence, summarized except when quoted, as follows: On 3 June 1970 Owen Swanson Doss and Henry Edward Manning, both of whom were Federal prisoners assigned to a work release unit located at Sandy Ridge near Greensboro, North Carolina, failed to return to their unit, stole an automobile and drove from Greensboro to a point near Goldsboro, North Carolina.  There the stolen car ran out of gas.  They then stole a truck and drove to a mobile home occupied by Paul Raymond Pierce and his 15-year-old son, William Raymond Pierce, near Winterville in Pitt County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doss and Manning spent the night there at the invitation of the elder Pierce, who had known Manning for 10 to 12 years.  The next morning Pierce left his son with Doss and Manning and went&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to work.  Manning sent a note by Pierce to his brother, Rufus Manning, who lived near the town of Ayden in Pitt County, and about noon Rufus arrived at the mobile home with a pint of whiskey and about $ 13 cash.  The three men drank this whiskey and most of two more pints which Rufus obtained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the afternoon, after Rufus left, Doss used a knife and a .22 rifle which he found in the home to force Manning and the Pierce boy to accompany him into the woods behind the house.  There he fired the rifle between the boy's legs and ordered him to undress.  Young Pierce began to cry, but removed all of his clothes except his socks.  Doss then forced Manning to attempt sodomy on him.  Manning was unsuccessful.  Doss then attempted to commit sodomy on the unwilling boy, and apparently was successful; however, the pathologist could not confirm that there had been any penetration.  No semen was found on Doss' clothing, but semen was found on the pants of Manning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While committing or attempting to commit sodomy, Doss began cutting the boy, lightly at first and then more savagely, causing blood to get all over the clothes of Doss.  To get Doss to stop cutting the boy, Manning told Doss that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  police officers were coming.  Doss and Manning left young Pierce in the woods and started out to the road.  There they were spotted by two deputy sheriffs who were looking for them because of their escape.  The sheriffs ordered them to stop; Manning did so and was apprehended, but Doss escaped.  At that time they were about 180 feet from where Pierce's dead body was found the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Paul Raymond Pierce returned from work that evening, he was stopped by the sheriff and told that Manning had been captured.  Pierce drove on to his home and looked for but could not find his son that night.  The next morning Pierce got up early to continue his search, and about 7 a.m. he found the nude body of his dead son in a wooded area behind the mobile home.  Officers were notified and a deputy sheriff arrived very quickly.  Manning's billfold was found near the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doss was apprehended at 11 a.m. on the same day in the attic of a nearby church.  Deputies later returned to the church and found underpants and blue slacks with blood all over them.  They also found a white shirt with blood stains on it in a tobacco patch near the church.  The blood on the clothes was determined to be type&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;O&quot;; the deceased and Doss both had type &quot;O&quot; blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church in which Doss was captured collected clothes for the needy and kept them in the room where Doss' underpants and slacks were found.  The trousers Doss was wearing when captured had been taken from the clothes stored at the church.  The shirt Doss was wearing at the time of the killing had been given to Doss by Manning and had Manning's name written in the collar.  This shirt was found in the tobacco field near the church.  Doss was wearing a white shirt and blue pants when seen by officers near Pierce's home and in the tobacco patch near the church where he was apprehended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. West, a pathologist, after describing the various wounds found on the body of the deceased, testified: &quot;Now, in summary of these wounds that I've just described there were twenty-one major incisional and/or puncture wounds.  The wound considered to be lethal was the large wound in the left side of the neck disrupting the left internal jugular vein.  The immediate cause of death was most likely massive hemorrhage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ernest Kornegy and Robert Miller were incarcerated in the Pitt County jail at the same time Doss and Manning were there.  Kornegy testified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he overheard Manning ask Doss why he killed the Pierce boy.  Doss replied that the boy hit him and then he (Doss) began to stab him.  Kornegy further stated that Doss said the blood on his clothes had begun to stink so he went into a church.  Miller was a cellmate of Manning and testified that he overheard Doss say, &quot;I'm going ahead and admit that I killed the boy&quot;; that Manning then asked him why he killed the boy, and Doss said, &quot;I don't know; just when I hit him that first time I went crazy and when I saw the blood I guess.&quot; Miller further testified that Doss asked Manning who he was celling up with over there and if he had had sex with him.  Manning said &quot;no,&quot; he did not play that game, and then Doss said if he was over there he would have intercourse with him and would not take &quot;no&quot; for an answer.  Miller stated Doss then said, &quot;You know what happened to the last person that said 'no'?&quot; Miller said &quot;no,&quot; and Doss said, &quot;Well, where do you think the blood on my clothes came from?&quot; Miller did not say anything, and Doss said, &quot;The boy that said that the last time isn't here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had been drinking heavily immediately before he murdered the victim. Defendant argued that the evidence as to his intoxication was sufficient to require the submission of the question of second degree murder and that the failure of the trial court to do so was error. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence. The court held that the intoxication defense was not available to defendant. The court observed that under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17, a homicide was murder in the first degree if it resulted from the commission or attempted commission of one of the four specified felonies or of any other felony inherently dangerous to life, without regard to whether the death was intended or not. The court stated that the crime committed in the instant case, where a young 15-year-old boy, under threat of gunfire and knife, was compelled to submit to an act of sodomy by defendant was a crime as atrocious and as inherently dangerous as the specified felonies in the statute. Although intoxication could be a defense to a specific intent crime, intent was not an issue in the case because the state did not have to prove premeditation or deliberation under &sect; 14-17.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the judgment entered by the district court was not one from which an appeal could be taken by the State. The court held that pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-179, the State could appeal when a criminal action was dismissed on the ground that the statute purporting to create the purported criminal offense on which the prosecution was based was unconstitutional and therefore afforded no basis for such prosecution. The court held that the statute did not go further and give the State the right to appeal from a judgment of not guilty notwithstanding the finding that the judgment was based in part on a finding that the statute under which defendant was charged was unconstitutional.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This collateral attack proceeding was initiated October 13, 1969, when petitioner filed in the North Carolina Court of Appeals a petition &quot;for leave to apply to Superior Court of Rutherford County for a writ of error </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">coram nobis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; In her petition, she asserted she had been brought to trial in the Superior Court of Rutherford County on a bill of indictment which charged that she, on the 19th day of June, 1969, in Rutherford County, &quot;did unlawfully and wilfully for the purpose of gain, exhibit obscene and immoral motion pictures, to wit: 'The Ramrodder' and 'A Piece of Her Action,' to an audience in Rutherford County on the premises of Mid-Way Drive In Theatre, Inc. Said Motion picture depicting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in its most lewd, lascivious and degrading form the act of sexual intercourse . . . .&quot; She also asserted the court, after reciting she had pleaded guilty as charged, pronounced judgment that she &quot;be confined in the Women's Division of the State's Prison and there to be assigned to work under the supervision of the State Department of Correction as provided by law for a period of six months&quot;; but provided that &quot;(t)he foregoing prison sentence&quot; was suspended for three years upon the following express terms and conditions:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout this collateral attack proceeding petitioner has been represented by counsel other than those who appeared for her at August 1969 Session of Rutherford Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pleading entitled &quot;Answer and Motion to Dismiss&quot; was filed by the Attorney General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon consideration, the Court of Appeals, on October 30, 1969, entered the following order: &quot;It is ordered that permission be granted for leave to apply to the Superior Court of Rutherford County for a writ of error </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">coram nobis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  If the application be denied, findings of fact should be made as a basis therefor and petitioner will be allowed to appeal as in other proceedings.  If the application is granted, the judgment will be vacated and the plea stricken out or permitted to be withdrawn and the case will be restored to the docket for trial . . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, petitioner filed in the Superior Court of Rutherford County an application dated November&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  10, 1969, for a writ of error </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">coram nobis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in which, for the reasons previously asserted in her petition filed in the Court of Appeals, she prayed that she be granted a new trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the March 9, 1970 Mixed Session of Rutherford Superior Court, The Honorable Frank W.

After setting forth findings of fact in detail, Judge Snepp denied &quot;petitioner's application for a new trial and other relief.&quot; In brief summary, Judge Snepp found that petitioner had been represented by able and experienced counsel; that her plea of guilty was voluntarily entered after she had been fully advised of her rights and of the consequences of her plea both by her counsel and by the court; and that petitioner's other grounds for attack on the judgment could have been but were not raised by petitioner on a direct appeal from the judgment entered at August 1969 Session.</SPAN></P>

Thus, it was unnecessary for the inmate to obtain leave from the appellate court or from the SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA before seeking a writ from the superior court. Thus, the case was remanded to the appellate court for its consideration of the exceptions presented by the inmate's appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Ervin, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 15 February 1971 Session of Buncombe, heard prior to determination by the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff sues for damages and for injunctive relief, alleging that her contract as a public school teacher in the Buncombe County Public School System was wrongfully terminated.  She alleges that she was initially employed as such teacher for the academic year 1964-1965 and served in that capacity during each succeeding academic year to and including the year 1968-1969.  She then alleges that at the close of the 1968-1969 school year, the County Board of Education, acting upon the recommendation of the principal and the District School Committee, terminated her contract arbitrarily and without cause, giving her no statement of the reason for her dismissal and no hearing with reference thereto, though the plaintiff requested both, and thereby the defendants violated her rights under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and Art. I, &sect; 17, of the Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff further contends that G.S. 115-142 provides no standard or procedure governing the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  termination of a public school teacher's contract at the end of a school year and, thereby, deprives her of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, since G.S. 115-145 does provide such standards and procedures governing the dismissal of teachers in the course of the school year.  She further alleges that the absence of such standards and procedures in G.S. 115-142 has a chilling effect upon the exercise of constitutional rights by teachers in violation of the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and in violation of Art. I, &sect;&sect; 17 and 35 of the Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She prays that the Court declare G.S. 115-142&nbsp;unconstitutional; that an injunction issue requiring the defendants to consider the renewal of the plaintiff's contract in the good faith exercise of their statutory discretion and duties; that an injunction issue requiring the defendants to provide the plaintiff with notice of the decision to terminate her contract; that they be required to provide her with a hearing before the County Board of Education and to cause a record of such hearing to be made&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reflecting the evidence for and against the plaintiff and the reasons for the decision of the board; and that she recover judgment for damages in varying amounts, depending upon whether or not part or all of the requested injunctive relief be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants allege in their answer that the County Board of Education gave to the plaintiff full, adequate and legal notice, as required by statute, of the decision not to renew her contract, and allege that no right of the plaintiff under the Constitution or laws of the United States, or of this State, has been violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties stipulated that the plaintiff was employed as a public school teacher in the Buncombe County School System for the academic year 1964-1965 and each academic year thereafter, through the academic year 1968-1969; that she served in such employment during the year 1968-1969; that on or before the last day of the 1968-1969 academic school year, the County Board of Education determined and, through the County Super-intendent of Schools, informed the plaintiff that her contract would not be renewed for the following academic school year, such notice being given by registered mail; and that the plaintiff was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not given a hearing by the County Board of Education concerning the termination of the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The written contract between the County Board of Education and the plaintiff, executed in May 1967, was in the prescribed form.  It did not specify a termination date.  It provided that it was entered into &quot;in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the school law applicable thereto;&quot; that the plaintiff agreed &quot;to discharge faithfully all the duties imposed * * * by the Laws of North Carolina and by the rules and regulations of the [County] Board of Education;&quot; that the Board of Education promised to pay the plaintiff &quot;for services rendered during the life of this contract;&quot; and that &quot;assignments to duties will be made by the superintendent of schools.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff moved for summary judgment, asserting that there is no genuine issue of material fact between the parties, except as to the nature of the relief to which she is entitled, and that she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  The defendants also moved for summary judgment, asserting that there is no genuine issue of any material fact and that they are entitled as a matter of law to a judgment dismissing the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties further stipulated that the defendants did not submit to the plaintiff at any time (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">i.e.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, prior to the institution of this action), either orally or in writing, any statement as to the reasons for the termination of her employment; and that the plaintiff mailed to the chairman of the District School Committee a letter requesting that the reasons for such termination be given, and mailed to the chairman of the County Board of Education a letter requesting that she be granted a hearing upon the termination of her contract, the defendants not denying that these letters were received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the plaintiff's request for admissions, the defendants denied that the board had no reason for terminating the plaintiff's contract at the end of the 1968-1969 school year and denied that its sole reason for so terminating it was that she was the wife of Joseph R. Still, whose contract was also terminated.  In explanation of its latter denial, the defendants asserted that the contract of the plaintiff's husband, who had been employed by the County Board of Education as a music teacher and band director at the same time and at the same school at which the plaintiff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was employed as a teacher, was not renewed at the end of the 1968-1969 school year and, since the likelihood was that he would obtain employment elsewhere and the plaintiff would probably find employment within the next school year at the same place, the plaintiff's contract was not renewed so that the County Board of Education would have an opportunity to hire a replacement for the plaintiff whose employment would likely be more permanent and would not be interrupted during the next school year.  In further explanation, the defendants asserted that the plaintiff was teaching outside the field for which she held a certificate, having been allowed to do so solely as a convenience to her and to her husband, thus allowing them to teach at the same school, which reason ceased to apply when the employment of the plaintiff's husband was not continued, and that by terminating the plaintiff's employment, the board would have the opportunity to hire a replacement who held a certificate in the particular field in which such teacher would be employed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants, responding to a further request by the plaintiff for admissions, admitted that the only reasons for terminating the plaintiff's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contract were that the plaintiff was the wife of Joseph R. Still and that she was teaching outside the field for which she was certified, but they denied that her contract would not have been terminated but for the fact that she was the wife of Joseph R. Still.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the defendants' request for admissions, the plaintiff stated that she is and, while employed as a teacher by the County Board of Education, was the wife of Joseph R. Still; that he was employed by the County Board of Education at the same time and at the same school as the plaintiff; that the plaintiff held a North Carolina &quot;A&quot; teaching certificate in the field of music and needed only one two-hour course in advanced composition to be certified in the field of English; that in the school year 1964-1965 she taught four periods of music and two periods of English; that in 1965-1966 she taught music, Latin and English; thereafter, Latin having been dropped from the curriculum, she taught three classes of music and three classes of English; that at all times she taught at least one-half of her courses in music, the field of her certification; that her teaching was at Erwin High School and at feeder schools; that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  some of her teaching was at schools at which her husband did not teach; and that the convenience of teaching at schools where in he taught was not a controlling consideration and was never raised as an issue at the time the plaintiff was employed or retained as a teacher in the Buncombe County School System.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Ervin entered judgment denying the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in its entirety and granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment, dismissing the plaintiff's action, &quot;on the grounds that the statutory scheme of the North Carolina Statutes is constitutional and that as to the issue of arbitrariness and capriciousness that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&quot; </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a former teacher, was terminated from her employment by defendant board of education (board). The teacher filed an action against the board and related others, and alleged that her contract was arbitrarily terminated without cause. The teacher requested injunctive relief. The parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court denied the teacher's motion, and granted the other parties' motion. The teacher appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">It was stipulated that the board followed the procedure for the teacher's termination that was prescribed by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115-142(b). The court held that it was permissible for &sect; 115-142(b) to prescribe one procedure for terminating the employment of a teacher during the school year and an entirely different terminating procedure for the dismissal of a teacher at the end of the school year. Under &sect; 115-142b, the board was permitted to terminate the teacher without a specified cause or circumstance. Further, under the terms of her contract, the teacher only had the right to continue to be employed by the board until her status was terminated as prescribed in &sect; 115-142b. Because, she was so terminated, there was no violation of the employment contract. Moreover, there was no merit to the teacher's assertion that she was denied equal protections of the laws as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The different treatments for teachers terminated during the school year, and those terminated at the end of the year did not violate the Constitution. Finally, there was no evidence that the teacher was terminated in retaliation for exercising a constitutional right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the board and related others. The teacher was not entitled to a notice providing the board's reasons for terminating her nor was she entitled to a hearing on her termination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Harry C. Martin, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 2 November 1970 Criminal Session of Mecklenburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon an indictment, proper in form, charging the defendant with the murder of Carla Jean Underwood, he was tried and convicted of murder in the first degree, the jury making no recommendation that he be sentenced to life imprisonment.  From a judgment imposing the sentence by death by asphyxiation, pursuant to the verdict, the defendant appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence for the State included the testimony of the defendant's alleged accomplice, Johnny Frazier, whose counsel was present.  Frazier gave a detailed account of the activities of the defendant and himself on the day in question.  The evidence for the State was to the following effect:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 18 June 1970, Carla Jean Underwood, 17 years of age, was employed by Belk's Department Store at the SouthPark Shopping Center in Charlotte, the shopping center being then still under construction.  At approximately 12:20 p.m., a fellow worker met her coming out of the store and going toward her automobile in the employees' parking lot.  After chatting briefly with the other employee, Miss Underwood went on to her car alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Frazier had driven into the parking lot a few minutes earlier.  They arrived in a stolen Volkswagen belonging to Mrs. Rose Collins.  About an hour before, they had kidnapped Mrs. Collins at gunpoint at another shopping center in the city (Woolco) and had taken her out into the country where they left her alone in the woods, bound and lying face down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Returning to the city in Mrs. Collins' automobile, the defendant and Frazier drove to the SouthPark Shopping Center and, shortly after their arrival, observed Miss Underwood enter her car.  The defendant then remarked to Frazier, &quot;There's a hit.&quot; The defendant got out of the car, which was then driven by Frazier, went to Miss Underwood's car and forced his way into the passenger seat, she being in the driver's seat.  A struggle followed and Miss Underwood was shot in the abdomen by the defendant with a .22 caliber pistol.  Frazier then drove the stolen Collins vehicle up to the Underwood car and the defendant, driving the Underwood car, said to him, &quot;Let's go.&quot; They left the parking lot, the defendant driving the Underwood vehicle and Frazier following in the Collins vehicle.  They drove a short distance to a wooded area.  There, Frazier&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  got out of the vehicle he was driving and went to the passenger side of the Underwood vehicle, driven by the defendant.  Miss Underwood was lying on the front seat with her head toward the door.  When Frazier opened the door, standing outside the car, he put one leg up and propped it behind Miss Underwood's shoulder.  She was trying to talk.  The defendant then fired four more bullets into Miss Underwood's abdomen, holding the pistol only a few inches from her body as he fired.  One of the bullets passed entirely through her body and into the leg of Frazier.  Only six or seven minutes elapsed between the first shooting of Miss Underwood and the firing of the four additional bullets into her body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant and Frazier then removed Miss Underwood's body from the car.  The defendant dragged her by the feet to some bushes where they left her after placing over her body a piece of plywood and an old carpet.  The body was found three days later badly decomposed.  An autopsy was performed in which four .22 caliber bullets were removed from the body, a fifth wound resulting from the bullet which passed entirely through the girl's body and into the leg of Frazier.  In the opinion of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  County Medical Examiner, who conducted the autopsy, the cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant, in open court, through his counsel, made a judicial admission that the body of Carla Jean Underwood was so discovered on 21 June 1970 and examined by the medical examiner and that Miss Underwood died as the result of five gunshot wounds in the abdomen inflicted by .22 caliber bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no suggestion that either the defendant or Frazier knew Miss Underwood or had ever seen her prior to this occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the shooting of Miss Underwood and the disposal of her body, the defendant and Frazier, one driving the Collins car and the other driving the Underwood car, returned to the point where they had left Mrs. Collins.  Not finding her there, they abandoned the Collins vehicle and, riding together in the Underwood vehicle, returned to the city and proceeded to a residence at which Mr. and Mrs. Bozart were visiting.  They conversed with Mrs. Bozart briefly, then left and subsequently returned in about twenty minutes.  This time they were met at the door by Mr. Bozart and after a brief conversation again left.  They then went to the defendant's house, from there&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to a dry cleaning establishment to pick up some clothes belonging to Frazier, carried these to Frazier's house and then drove to a point in the city at which Westbrook poured gasoline into the interior of the Underwood car and burned it.  The City Fire Department arrived at the burning car at approximately 3:50 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the burning of the Underwood car, Frazier, in order to obtain medical attention for his wound without accounting for it truthfully, falsely swore out a warrant against his father-in-law charging him with shooting Frazier.  (The bullet removed from Frazier's leg was introduced in evidence and was a .22 caliber bullet fired from the same weapon as three of the bullets removed from Miss Underwood's body, the fourth bullet removed from her body being so distorted that it could not be determined from what weapon it was fired.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On cross-examination by the defendant, Frazier testified that he, himself, was also under indictment for the murder of Miss Underwood, that on 16 June he was arrested for armed robbery in Cabarrus County, and that he had also been arrested a short time earlier for cutting his wife on the street in Charlotte, posting a bond for his release pending&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trial on this charge.  He further testified on cross-examination that he was then under a suspended sentence of two years for another offense, not specified, and had pending against him a charge of arson, a charge of assault on his wife by cutting her, a charge of shooting into his father-in-law's house, a charge of kidnapping (apparently the kidnapping of Mrs. Collins) and a charge of murder (apparently the murder of Miss Underwood).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant testified as a witness in his own behalf.  The substance of his testimony was as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is 22 years of age.  In 1966, while in high school, he was sentenced to prison for housebreaking.  While serving this sentence, he escaped twice.  He was paroled 5 January 1970.  He got a job and was married 27 April 1970, but was laid off about the middle of May because his employer got caught up on its work.  Thereafter, he became acquainted with Frazier.  On 13 June, five days before the killing of Miss Underwood, he, Frazier and another man, committed an armed robbery in Concord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 18 June 1970, he requested Frazier to take him to his former employer's place of business to see about resuming his job.  They traveled in Frazier's mother's car, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the defendant driving.  At Frazier's suggestion, they turned into a shopping center (Woolco) and parked.  Frazier got out of the car and two or three minutes later the defendant followed him.  When he overtook Frazier, he observed that Frazier was standing over Mrs. Collins who was lying on the ground, Frazier holding a .22 caliber pistol in his hand.  The defendant helped Frazier put Mrs. Collins in the Collins car.  He and Frazier took her out to a place off Highway 49 and, after tying her up, left her there, Frazier having taken from her pocketbook the money therein, which Frazier called &quot;chump change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Returning to the city in Mrs. Collins' car, they picked up Frazier's mother's car and left the Collins vehicle at the K-Mart parking lot.  They proceeded in the Frazier car to the SouthPark Shopping Center, the defendant driving.  When they stopped there, Frazier said, &quot;I see a hit town,&quot; and immediately got out of the car, telling the defendant to follow him, which the defendant did in the Frazier car.  When he reached the Underwood car, the defendant saw Frazier and Miss Underwood therein, Miss Underwood being seated in the driver's seat.  When the defendant parked the Frazier&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vehicle and got out, he heard a shot.  He rushed to the passenger's side of the Underwood car and saw Frazier and Miss Underwood struggling, Frazier having a pistol in his hand.  The defendant grabbed the pistol through the car window and the pistol fired again, the shot striking Frazier in the leg.  Thereupon, the defendant having released the pistol, Frazier commenced shooting Miss Underwood and shot her there in the parking lot more than twice.  The defendant then followed Frazier out of the parking lot, Frazier driving the Underwood car containing Miss Underwood's body, and the defendant driving Frazier's mother's car.  When they stopped and tried to remove Miss Underwood's body from the car, Frazier dropped her because of the injury to his leg.  Miss Underwood's body was dragged about three feet and, at Frazier's request, the defendant handed him a piece of plywood which Frazier put over the body.  The defendant threw some rags over it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They then drove to Frazier's home, remaining there just long enough to leave the Frazier car.  Thereupon, riding together in the Underwood car, the defendant driving, they went back to the K-Mart, where they had left the Collins vehicle.  Frazier&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  then got into the Collins car, the defendant continuing to drive the Underwood car, and they drove back out to where they had left Mrs. Collins, bound and lying in the woods.  Their intent was to bring her back to the city and leave her bound in her car in the shopping center parking lot.  They did not find Mrs. Collins where they had left her.  They then left the Collins car there and returned to the city in the Underwood vehicle.  Thereupon, they stopped at the house where they saw Mr. and Mrs. Bozart.  Following their second stop at this house, they went to the dry cleaning establishment to get Frazier's clothes.  They took the clothes to Frazier's home and then drove the Underwood car to the place where it was set on fire and left burning, Frazier sprinkling the gasoline in the car and setting it on fire for the purpose of removing his fingerprints from within the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they carried Mrs. Collins out to the wooded area where they bound and left her, the defendant heard Frazier tell Mrs. Collins that he wanted $ 5,000 from her.  Statements given by Frazier and also those given by the defendant to the investigating officers concerning their activities on the day of the kidnapping&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Mrs. Collins and the killing of Miss Underwood contained untruths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1963 the defendant was convicted of seven counts of housebreaking and larceny.  In 1966 he was convicted of unlawfully taking automobiles.  He does not remember whether he was convicted in 1966 of three cases of housebreaking and larceny.  On 16 November 1966, he escaped from prison and was convicted of that offense.  He was again convicted of escape on 17 January 1967 and was indicted for larceny while an escapee the second time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was the driver of the car in the robbery perpetrated by him, Frazier and their companion in Concord five days before the killing of Miss Underwood.  In that robbery they used a sawed-off shotgun.  In the course of the robbery, the defendant went into the store and at one time held the gun as he searched through the store for other occupants than those who were tied up by him and his companions.  The victims of that robbery, who were tied and left in the store, were both women.  The defendant has known how to steal since 1963 and needed no training by Frazier in that activity.  </SPAN></P>

(Harry C.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 31 August 1970 Session of Mecklenburg, transferred from the Court of Appeals for initial appellate review by the Supreme Court under its general order of 31 July 1970, entered pursuant to G.S. 7A-31(b) (4).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an action instituted against the North Carolina State Highway Commission (Commission) under G.S. 136-111 to obtain compensation for the alleged taking of plaintiff's property.  The following facts are stipulated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff and his wife, as tenants by the entireties, own two lots of land fronting on Eastway Drive in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The lots do not adjoin.  The first, known as 2331 Eastway Drive, has a frontage of 180 feet; the second, known as 725 Eastway Drive, has a frontage of 65 feet.  In order to widen Eastway Drive (State Highway Project No. 8.2722202), on 1 April 1969, Commission appropriated in perpetuity an easement 30 feet X 180 feet across the front of the first lot.  For the same purpose, on 30 May 1969, Commission appropriated a similar easement 30 feet X 65 feet across the front of the second lot.  On 23 June 1969, more than 24 months after Commission had appropriated these easements, plaintiff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  instituted this action to recover damages in the sum of $ 6,000.00 for the taking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c11">Inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the complaint alleges that, in widening Eastway Drive &quot;during late 1966 and early 1967,&quot; defendant reduced the area of plaintiff's property and removed valuable shade trees and underground tile; that defendant had taken plaintiff's property &quot;without notice and without compensation . . . and that plaintiff has at no time been offered or paid any sums whatsoever for the property which was thus taken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answering, defendant alleged: (1) Street-widening Project No. 8.2722202 was &quot;solely within a previously existing 100-foot wide right-of-way easement belonging to the State Highway Commission. . . .&quot;; (2) the taking of the property described in the complaint occurred more than 24 months before the institution of this action, and &quot;defendant specifically pleads the statute of limitations set forth in G.S. 136-111&quot; in bar of plaintiff's right to maintain this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the pretrial hearing held pursuant to G.S. 136-108, after finding facts in accordance with the parties' stipulations and the admissions in the pleadings, Judge Martin ruled that &quot;this action is barred by the provisions of G.S. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  136-111.&quot; From his judgment dismissing the suit, plaintiff appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landowner appealed a judgment of the Civil Session of Mecklenburg County Superior Court (North Carolina), which entered judgment dismissing the landowner's action against defendant North Carolina State Highway Commission under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136-111 to obtain compensation for the alleged taking of the landowner's property. The court concluded that the action was barred by the limitations provision of &sect; 136-111.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission took 30 feet of two lots owned by the landowner that fronted a street for a widening project, alleging that the property was already included within the right of way. The landowner initiated his action more than 24 months after the appropriations. The court observed that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136-111 provided that any person whose land had been taken by an act of the Highway Commission was allowed to file a complaint for the purposes of determining compensation within 24 months. The landowner contended that &sect; 136-111 was unconstitutional as applied to the facts of the case, arguing that the Commission took the easements with no intention of compensating him and that in such a case due process required written notice to the landowner that he would receive no compensation unless he brought suit with the specified time. The court held that, having failed to question the constitutionality of &sect; 136-111 in the trial court, the landowner could not attack the statute on that ground on appeal. Nevertheless, the court observed that a landowner's right to recover by court action under &sect; 136-111 in no way depended on whether the Commission intended to compensate him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding under the Declaratory Judgment Act, G.S. 1-253&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plaintiffs instituted this action against the City of Wilmington on behalf of themselves and other members of the Fire Department of the City of Wilmington and the Wilmington Fire Fighters' Association, Local No. 1284.  The complaint alleges: Plaintiffs are residents of Wilmington and are employed by the City as firemen.  Plaintiffs have requested permission to move their residences to locations in New Hanover County, outside the city limits of Wilmington.  Defendants have consistently refused such permission and have informed plaintiffs that the employment of any fireman who moves outside the city limits will be terminated.  Plaintiffs believe that G.S. 160-115.1 gives a city fireman the right to reside outside the municipality by which he is employed.  A genuine controversy exists between plaintiffs and defendants, and plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration of their rights under the applicable statutes.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Answering, defendants admit they have refused the request of certain firemen that they be allowed to move outside the city limits.  They allege (1) that G.S. 160-115.1 was repealed by G.S. 160-25; (2) that there is no justiciable controversy now existing between plaintiffs and the City; and (3) that the action should be dismissed because plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Cowper heard the case without a jury.  He concluded that G.S. 160-115.1 and G.S. 160-25 are in conflict and, &quot;because of the two conflicting statutes, the court is of the opinion and finds as a fact that the above action should be dismissed.&quot; From his judgment dismissing the action, plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the dismissal upon the premise that the allegations of the complaint &quot;do not present a justiciable controversy.&quot; Upon plaintiffs' petition we allowed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff firemen sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which found the firemen's declaratory judgment action against defendant city was a non-justiciable controversy and thus, refused to determine whether the city had the power to terminate the firemen for living outside the city, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 160-115.1, 160-25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the firemen claimed the right to live outside the city limits, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-115.1, the city contended &sect; 160-115.1 had been repealed by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-25 and threatened to terminate the employment of any fireman who moved outside of the city. Thereafter, the firemen brought a declaratory judgment action against the city, and when the appeals court found a non-justiciable controversy, the firemen sought review. In reversing, the court held the firemen were not required to risk employment by moving outside the city in order to make a test case because such a requirement thwarted the remedial purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act (Act). After holding the action presented an actual controversy that was justiciable under the Act, the court held the firemen were required to live within the city limits because &sect; 160-25 had empowered the city to require city residence through its charter. In examining the city's charter, the court held that because firemen were required to possess the right to vote and the right to vote required residence within the city, the firemen were required by the charter to reside within the city.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 1, 1969, the North Carolina Automobile Rate Administrative Office (Rate Office) made a filing with the Commissioner of Insurance (Commissioner), pursuant to G.S. 58-248, which proposed a schedule of increased rates on private passenger automobile liability insurance in the amount of 1.5% for bodily injury insurance and 11.7% for property damage insurance, making an overall (composite) increase of 5.3%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After due advertisement, the Commissioner, on September 16, 1969, conducted a public hearing, which was continued to and resumed on September 18, 1969.  It was then continued to and resumed on October 6, 7, 9, 14 and 15, and November 12, 1969.  It was concluded on November 18, 1969.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing, the evidence presented by the Rate Office consisted of numerous exhibits and the testimony of its General Manager, Paul Mize, and of John C.

The Commissioner called as witnesses George Edward King, Chief Fiscal Examiner, and Robert Holcombe, Assistant Fire and Casualty Actuary, both of the staff of the North Carolina Department of Insurance.  The Attorney General offered no evidence.  Statements presented by individual members of the public are not material to the present appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his order of December 18, 1969, which comprises eleven pages of the record, the Commissioner, after preliminary recitals, made certain &quot;Findings of Fact,&quot; stated &quot;Conclusions,&quot; and approved an increase in the rate level of 2.8% effective on and after January 28, 1970.  He denied the requested overall rate level increase of 5.3%.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill of indictment, proper in form, charges defendant with the forcible rape of Catherine Carr in Johnston County on 16 December 1967, a violation of G.S. 14-21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence -- defendant offered none -- tends to show that Catherine (Kathy) Carr, age four years, was living in Smithfield, Johnston County, with her maternal grandmother on 16 December 1967.  The defendant was her stepfather.  He lived in Smithfield and the child's mother, who at the time was living separate and apart from defendant, lived in Durham.  Prior to the separation they had all lived together at defendant's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 5 p.m. on 16 December 1967 defendant drove his station wagon to the home of the grandmother and told her he wanted to take Kathy to see her mother in Durham.  They located Kathy at the home of a relative, picked her up and returned to the grandmother's home where a change of clothing was assembled for the child.  Defendant and Kathy then left together.  The grandmother, an experienced hospital nurse's aide, observed nothing unusual about defendant.  He appeared to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her to be perfectly normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 9:45 p.m. defendant, driving his station wagon, pulled up in front of the Charcoal Inn Restaurant in Smithfield.  There was no one else in the station wagon.  He got out and entered the restaurant.  His clothing was disarranged.  He went to the restroom and remained there about five minutes.  When he emerged his hair had been combed, his shirttail was tucked in and his clothing properly arranged.  He purchased a Coca-Cola, drank some of it, went out to his station wagon, opened the door but never got in.  He immediately shut the door, returned to the restaurant, and announced that someone had kidnapped his child.  He made conflicting statements as to where the child had been in the vehicle.  In the opinion of a police officer who was seated in the restaurant in civilian clothes, and who had observed the station wagon through the window from the time it arrived until defendant announced that someone had stolen the child, he acted normal at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigating officers warned defendant &quot;that he had an absolute right to remain silent, that he did not have to answer any questions, or make any statements to me whatsoever; that anything that he did&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  say could be used against him in a court of law; that he was entitled to a lawyer at any time he so desired; that if he could not afford a lawyer and wanted a lawyer, that one would be appointed for him by the State of North Carolina.  I also told him that if he elected to answer questions that he could terminate the interview at any time he so desired and that a lawyer would be appointed for him if he wanted one.  I also asked him if he understood each of these rights.  He stated that he did.  I asked him if he wanted a lawyer and he stated that he did not want one.&quot; Defendant first told the officers that after he left the home of the maternal grandmother with Kathy he drove to his home to call his parole officer for permission to leave the county in order to go to Durham; that he was unsuccessful in contacting his parole officer; that after the second unsuccessful call he and Kathy rode around looking at Christmas lights in Smithfield and Selma until about 10 o'clock, when he stopped at the Charcoal Inn Restaurant to visit the restroom; that Kathy was standing on the seat beside him and when he stopped she lay down on the seat and he covered her with his field jacket; that when he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  returned from the restroom Kathy was gone; that he so informed the people inside the restaurant and requested that the police department be called; that the officers came, searched the area, but were unable to locate her.  This statement was made on 17 December 1967 at about 12:30 p.m. He repeated the same story to the officers the following day at 12:30 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was taken to SBI Headquarters in Raleigh, again warned of his constitutional rights, and interviewed by SBI Agent Robert D. Emerson.  This interview took place on 18 December 1967 from 6:05 to 6:46 p.m. He told Mr. Emerson that after he picked up his stepdaughter Kathy Carr he left the grandmother's home and drove to his residence; that he attempted unsuccessfully to telephone his parole officer and then decided to have intercourse with Kathy; that he did so and that she screamed and struggled; that the child was torn and he used a sheet and a washcloth to wipe the blood from the child; that he dressed her, took her to his station wagon and left with her.  Defendant then drew a map, without assistance, using paper and pen supplied by the officer.  The map was accurate, and, accompanied by defendant, the officers found&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kathy's body buried in a pine woods in Wayne County, eighteen miles from defendant's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A postmortem examination by Dr. Dewey Harris Page, pathologist, revealed that Kathy had been penetrated and had suffered a tear in the posterior vaginal wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found defendant guilty of rape and the presiding judge pronounced a sentence of death as required by law.  Defendant appealed to the Supreme Court assigning errors discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant confessed that he raped his four-year-old stepdaughter. The court found no error in allowing the State to challenge seven jurors who each expressed that there were no circumstances under which they could conscientiously return a verdict that would result in the death penalty because their irrevocable commitment was a valid cause for challenge. Likewise, there was no error in allowing a panel of 12 jurors to be passed on by the State before any jurors were tendered to the defense. Defendant's confession was properly admitted into evidence where he was fully informed of his rights each time he was questioned, appeared to be coherent and to understand the proceedings, and there was no coercion. Allusions in evidence and argument to the fact that the victim was dead were unavoidable because the crimes were so closely interrelated. There was no error in the charge to the jury because language that pointedly brought to the attention of the jury that, absent its recommendation of life imprisonment, the court would pronounce a sentence of death, a duty required by law, was insufficient to constitute an expression of opinion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged jointly with Thomas Earl Stocks, in two separate bills of indictment, with rape and first degree burglary.  Defendant was tried on both bills and was found guilty as charged, with recommendations of life imprisonment on each charge.  From judgment pronounced in accordance therewith, defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial the State offered evidence which indicated the following: On 27 April 1970 at approximately 1:30 a.m., two men, a Negro and a white man, entered the home occupied by Mrs. Ann Baker Barry and her infant daughter, and each raped Mrs. Barry by force and against her will.  Mrs. Barry's husband was away from home on this occasion, and she and her thirteen-months-old daughter were alone in the house.  Before she went to bed about 11 p.m., Mrs. Barry locked the doors to the house.  When she awoke later and saw the two men in her bedroom she screamed.  One of the men pressed a knife against her throat and threatened her and her infant daughter; when she attempted to resist, the knife was pressed harder against her throat, inflicting a number of cuts or nicks.  After raping her, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  two men left.  Mrs. Barry waited a short time and then summoned the assistance of a neighbor and officers from the Pitt County Sheriff's Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers from the Sheriff's Department arrived at the home about 2:30 a.m. and found that the back screen was ripped open, the lock to the main door was chipped on the side, and this door was open.  There were also scratches on the sliding glass doors to the den.  Fingerprints located on the door to Mrs. Barry's bedroom were later identified as defendant's.  Other physical evidence removed at this time included bed linens on which samples of human hair were found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About one week later, on Friday, May 1, 1970, two members of the Pitt County Sheriff's Department questioned the defendant concerning this crime.  The defendant denied any knowledge concerning it.  The next day the defendant was again questioned, at which time the defendant admitted that he and Stocks broke into the home of Mrs. Barry and that each of them raped her.  He then took the officers to his home where he gave them the knife which he said was pressed against Mrs. Barry's throat while she was being raped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Edgar S. Douglas, an obstetrician and gynecologist, examined&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Barry at 3:45 a.m. on the night the crime was committed.  He found a series of marks on her neck, fresh scratch marks, and his examination revealed the presence of male spermatozoa in Mrs. Barry's vagina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant only offered the testimony of Dr. Bruce Kyles.  This testimony and other evidence germane to the decision in this case will be discussed in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Criminal Session of Pitt County Superior Court (North Carolina), entered upon a jury verdict, convicting him of rape and first degree burglary, and imposing a sentence of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A white man and black man broke into a woman's home and raped her at knife-point in her bedroom. Police later found defendant's fingerprints on the bedroom door. A pubic hair found on the bed was determined to be microscopically identical to that of black men. Defendant, who was a black man, was questioned, but he denied any knowledge of the incident. When he was questioned again the next day, after several hours, he admitted his involvement. At a voir dire hearing, defendant claimed that, during the questioning, he was intoxicated and officers had a blackjack and can of mace on the table. The officers denied any threatening conduct. The confession was allowed at trial and defendant was convicted. In affirming on appeal, the supreme court ruled that the trial court's findings that the confession was freely and voluntarily made were conclusive because they were supported by competent evidence. The hair and testimony regarding the analysis of the hair were relevant, in that they provided a link in the chain to prove that a black man committed the crimes and that defendant was that black man. There was no evidence that the recovered fingerprints had been altered or tampered with.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c1"><SPAN CLASS="c4">January 20, 1971, Filed </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeals, reported in 9 N.C. App. 452.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the 19 January 1970 Session of Buncombe Superior Court, the defendant was tried on two separate warrants charging: (1) Wilful and unlawful possession off his own premises of a dangerous weapon, to wit, a 12-gauge shotgun and shells, in an area in which a declared emergency existed, in violation of G.S. 14-288.7; and (2) violation of an emergency curfew ordinance of the City of Asheville by being on a public street in the city between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. He was found guilty of both offenses.  Upon the first charge, he was sentenced to six months in the county jail but the sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation for three years.  On the second charge, he was fined $ 25.00.  From both judgments he appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 27 February 1969, the City Council of Asheville adopted Ordinance No. 613.  The ordinance provides:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;A state of emergency shall be deemed to exist whenever, during times of great public crisis, disaster, rioting, catastrophe, or similar public emergency, for any reason, municipal public safety authorities are unable to maintain public order or afford adequate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  protection for lives or property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ordinance authorizes the Mayor of the City to issue a public proclamation declaring the existence of a state of emergency and placing in effect certain restrictions &quot;in the event of an existing or threatened state of emergency endangering the lives, safety, health and welfare of the people within the City of Asheville, or threatening damage to or destruction of property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restrictions which the Mayor is authorized by the ordinance to impose during such proclaimed emergency include: (1) Prohibition of the possession off one's own premises of explosives, firearms, ammunition, or dangerous weapons of any kind; and (2) prohibition or regulation of travel upon any public street except by those traveling for specified purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ordinance provides that it shall be unlawful for any person to violate any restriction so imposed during the existence of a proclaimed state of emergency and such violation shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not exceeding $ 50.00 or by imprisonment not exceeding 30 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 3 p.m. on 29 September 1969, the Mayor issued a proclamation, effective immediately, providing that it would remain in effect until dissolved&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by him or by the City Council.  The proclamation recited the adoption of the above mentioned ordinance and that &quot;certain unknown persons, by various and sundry illegal acts, have attempted and are now attempting to interfere with and disrupt normal activities of this City and a great danger exists, both as to persons and property, as a result of the illegal acts of these unknown persons.&quot; It proclaimed the existence of a state of emergency within the City of Asheville and declared that until such state of emergency ended &quot;it shall be unlawful for any person to possess off their own premises * * * any explosive, firearms, gunpowder, ammunition or dangerous weapons of any kind.&quot; It further declared that any violation of the proclamation during the existence of such state of emergency would be unlawful and punishable, upon conviction, by a fine not exceeding $ 50.00 or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 30 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 4:30 p.m. on the same day, the Mayor issued another proclamation reciting the earlier proclamation of a state of emergency and directing all persons &quot;from and after 9 p.m. on this the 29th day of September 1969, to observe a curfew and remain in their homes, offices&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or businesses during the hours from 9 p.m. o'clock to 6 a.m. o'clock until such time as this proclamation shall be dissolved by the Mayor * * * or City Council * * * said curfew to continue from day to day, subject to the exemptions hereinafter set forth.&quot; This proclamation declared that any violation of it would be punishable, upon conviction, by a fine not exceeding $ 50.00 or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 30 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A like proclamation was issued by the Mayor at 5 p.m. on 30 September 1969 and another like proclamation at 4 p.m. on 1 October 1969.  On 2 October 1969, the Mayor, declaring, &quot;It now appears that the cause of danger to the citizens of the City of Asheville has decreased and that the curfew is no longer necessary to the safety and welfare of our citizens,&quot; directed that &quot;the curfew imposed upon the 29th day of September, 1969 by proclamation is herein and hereby rescinded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence for the State, in addition to the above mentioned ordinance and proclamations, consisted of the stock or butt of a shotgun, a barrel of a twelve-gauge shotgun, fitting the butt, five twelve-gauge shotgun shells, loaded with No. 9 shot, and the testimony of a State Highway patrolman&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and four city police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The substance of the testimony of these officers was:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 11:10 p.m. on 30 September 1969, Highway Patrolman Jennings and other officers were on duty at a check point at a street intersection in the City of Asheville known as Six Points.  A 1968 Mustang, owned by the defendant and driven by Victor Chalk, Jr., approached the intersection, made a right turn onto another street and then stopped for a stop sign.  Patrolman Jennings approached the automobile on the driver's side.  The defendant was riding as a passenger in the front seat.  No one else was in the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrolman Jennings asked Chalk to exhibit his driver's license and requested Chalk and the defendant to get out of the car.  Chalk got out first.  When he did so, Patrolman Jennings, standing outside the automobile, was able to look into it and, by means of the street lights, could see upon the floor of the back seat about two inches of the stock or butt of a shotgun protruding from beneath some papers.  The defendant was still seated in the right of the two front bucket seats of the car, from which position he could reach the back floor by reaching through the open space between&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the two front seats.  Patrolman Jennings pulled the butt of the shotgun out of the car at that time.  He noticed it struck something on the floor with a clanging noise of metal striking metal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrolman Jennings placed Chalk under arrest and turned him over to the custody of Police Officer Simmons.  Patrolman Jennings then went around to the other side of the automobile, opened the door and requested the defendant to get out, which he did.  The defendant was then arrested for curfew violation and, with Chalk, was turned over to the custody of Sergeant Cook of the City Police Force.  Again looking in the back of the car beneath the papers on the floor, Patrolman Jennings found the barrel of a twelve-gauge shotgun, which he removed from the car.  He fitted the barrel onto the butt of the gun and delivered both to Sergeant Cook.  These two portions of the shotgun are among the State's exhibits above mentioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Patrolman Jennings first asked Chalk for his driver's license, prior to Chalk's getting out of the car and the discovery of the gun butt, he inquired as to why Chalk was &quot;out that night.&quot; Chalk replied that &quot;he was afraid they were going to burn his mother's home and he was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  going to assist her.&quot; In addition to the butt and barrel of the shotgun, a length of iron pipe was lying on the papers on the floor in the back of the car.  The firing mechanism of the shotgun was in good working order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Officer Simmons also approached the car and shined his flashlight into it to see what the defendant, then still in the car, was doing.  With this he observed a twelve-gauge shotgun shell lying on the back seat, which shell he then took from the car.  The defendant and Chalk were then carried to the police station.  Sergeant Cook rode with them in the back seat of the police car.  During this ride, which took approximately five minutes, nothing was passed from Chalk to the defendant.  After they were booked at the police station, Sergeant Cook searched the defendant and found four other twelve-gauge shotgun shells, two in each of his socks, stuck down into the top of his ankle-high boots.  The five shells are among the State's exhibits above mentioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the commencement of the trial, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence of the shotgun parts and shells taken from the car, contending that these were fruits of an illegal search without a search&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  warrant.  (He also objected at the trial to their introduction in evidence and to the testimony relating to the finding of these articles.) Thereupon, in the absence of the jury, Patrolman Jennings was examined with reference to his discovery of these articles.  His testimony on this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> examination was substantially the same as his subsequent testimony before the jury, above summarized.  He took the shotgun butt from the car before any other officer approached the vehicle.  The defendant was then seated in the car.  Chalk was standing outside the vehicle.  Both Chalk and the defendant had gotten out of the car and were standing some 20 feet therefrom, in the custody of Officers Simmons and Cook, when Patrolman Jennings found the barrel of the shotgun under the papers on the floor of the car and removed it therefrom.  The motion to suppress the evidence was overruled and Patrolman Jennings thereafter testified in the presence of the jury as above stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over objection by the defendant, the two cases against him were consolidated for trial.  At the trial, upon the conclusion of the State's evidence, the defendant requested that he be permitted to take the witness stand to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testify concerning &quot;his presence in the curfew and that question only and the cross-examination be limited to that.&quot; The trial judge refused to so limit the State's right of cross-examination if the defendant took the stand as a witness in his own behalf.  Thereupon, the defendant elected not to testify and offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to quash both warrants on the ground that the proclamation of the curfew was invalid.  He contended that no actual state of emergency existed when the curfew was proclaimed.  For this reason, he contended, the proclamation of a state of emergency and the proclamation of the curfew were arbitrary and denied the defendant his rights in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  A further ground for the motion to quash was that the North Carolina statute, pursuant to which the city ordinance was passed and the state of emergency and the curfew were proclaimed, is unconstitutional because vague and over-broad and because it fails to set forth any objective standards under which a city may declare a state of emergency.  For these reasons, the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contended that the statute violated his rights under the First, Fourth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and Article I, &sect; 17, of the Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to trial, and in the absence of the jury, the court conducted a hearing with reference to the motion to quash.  At this hearing, the defendant's evidence consisted of the testimony of Mayor Montgomery.  That of the State consisted of the testimony of the Sheriff of Buncombe County, the Chief of Police and the Assistant Chief of Police of the City, the City Manager and the news director of the Asheville Radio Station.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the court denied the motion to quash, making detailed findings of fact, amply supported by the evidence, and summarized as follows (numbering revised):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On 29 September 1969, at approximately 11 a.m. o'clock, a confrontation took place at Asheville High School between officials of the school and a large group of students.  The students were presenting grievances concerning alleged infractions of their rights and were not attending classes.  The school officials requested the students engaged in this process to disperse, which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  they refused to do.  The school officials thereupon requested assistance from the Police Department of the city in restoring order on the school premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In response to this request, police officers were dispatched to the school premises.  Prior to the arrival of the police, the City Manager had been in conference with the school officials on the school premises for approximately an hour.  Upon arrival at the school, the commander of the police contingent requested the students to disperse.  A majority of them did so, but others remained and the police officers were then directed to disperse them.  Thereupon, a further confrontation occurred between these students and the police officers, resulting in numerous personal injuries, both to the police officers and to the students, and in extensive destruction of school property, the overturning of an automobile on the school premises, the throwing of rocks and general turmoil on the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Immediately following this confrontation, the Mayor went in person to the Asheville High School and observed the damage to property and the emotional disturbance of persons still present at the scene.  The Mayor then proceeded to another&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  high school where students had congregated.  There he observed law enforcement personnel on the school premises, no personal injury or property damage having taken place at that school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Thereupon, a special meeting of the Community Relations Council, a recently formed organization, was convened, the Mayor being present.  A large crowd attended the meeting.  The Mayor observed emotional upset prevalent in the crowd and heard threats made by persons, whom the Mayor deemed otherwise responsible leaders of their community, to the effect that unless the demands of the complainants were met the complainants would burn the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Mayor, a doctor of medicine, inquired in local hospitals and was informed concerning injuries sustained by various persons during the above events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The Mayor also attended another meeting at the Urban Renewal Office, approximately one mile from the Asheville High School, where there was a conference with 20 or 30 students.  The tenor of this meeting was &quot;less than cordial&quot; and the implication was that unless demands of the students were met, &quot;dire results would be invoked upon the property of the City of Asheville.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Because of the above confrontations&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  some of the schools of the city were closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The Mayor then conferred with the Police Department.  He was advised by the police of other violations of the law, such as the throwing of rocks at police vehicles and at vehicles of travelers upon local streets of the city, the striking of police cars with bricks and rocks, the infliction of property damage and personal injury, and the making at various meetings of threats to damage the property of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon these findings, the judge concluded that the Mayor was acting within the scope of the power conferred upon him by the ordinance, in accordance with G.S. 14-288.1 through G.S. 14-288.19.  The court further concluded that the Mayor's proclamation of a state of emergency was not arbitrary and violated no right of the defendant under the Constitution of the United States or under the Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate order, the court denied the motion to quash the warrants made on the ground that G.S. 14-288.1 through G.S. 14-288.19 are unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing of the motion to quash the warrants, the Mayor testified that the above confrontation, inspection of damage to school property, meetings attended&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by him and conferences with police officers occurred on 29 September and that his decision to proclaim the existence of a state of emergency was based upon his own observation and upon the advice of the law enforcement officials.  He further testified that, prior to his issuance of the second curfew proclamation on 30 September, he had been advised of no additional property damage or personal injuries, but he had again had a meeting with the Chief of Police of the City, the Sheriff of the County, officers of the State Highway Patrol, the FBI representatives, the SBI representatives, the United States Attorney, the United States Marshal, the ATU representative and the City Manager.  Based on this conference and on the experience and opinions of these law enforcement officers, it was his own opinion that the curfew was still necessary on 30 September and so he issued the second curfew proclamation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayor further testified that, at the meeting of the Community Relations Council on 29 September, which was attended by a crowd which overflowed the conference room, there were threats to burn the community from both students and adults whom he would consider of normal faculties but emotionally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upset.  This meeting lasted approximately an hour, with many people expressing themselves.  &quot;The tone was always the same with regard to what had happened to them physically at the school, what would happen to the city if certain conditions were not brought about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time the Mayor proclaimed a state of emergency in the city on 29 September, the Governor of the State had dispatched approximately 15 special State Highway Patrol officers to the city on account of these conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of 30 September (the night the defendant and Chalk were arrested), at least one person was arrested and charged with possession of a fire bomb.  The Chief of Police of the City recommended to the Mayor that a curfew be imposed on the night of 30 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 29 September, rocks were thrown at the automobile of the Sheriff of the County, the radio antenna was jerked from his car and other damage was done to it by an assembled crowd at the intersection of Southside and Ashland Streets following the incident at the Asheville High School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Court of Appeals, the defendant assigned as error: (1) The denial of his motion to quash, based upon the unconstitutionality of the proclamation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the state of emergency and the proclamation of the curfew; (2) the denial of his motion to quash, based upon the unconstitutionality of G.S. 14-288.1 to G.S. 14-288.19; (3) the admission in evidence of the parts of the shotgun and of the shotgun shells and of the testimony relating to their discovery; (4) the consolidation of the two cases for trial and the refusal to allow his request to curtail the cross-examination of the defendant, if he elected to testify on the charge of curfew violation only; (5) the denial of the defendant's motion for judgment of nonsuit; and (6) the refusal of the trial court, when requested by the defendant, to include in his charge to the jury a reading of a portion of the ordinance of the city above mentioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals found no merit in any of these assignments of error and affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court.  In his present appeal, the defendant asserts the same assignments of error.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted on a certain weapons charge and violation of an emergency curfew ordinance. At the evidence suppression hearing, the trial court found that the evidence had been properly obtained and denied defendant's motion to quash the warrants on constitutional grounds and to limit cross-examination at trial. The appellate court affirmed, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant was riding in a car that was stopped by the police. Since the defendant did not provide sufficient reason for violating a citywide curfew, he was arrested for a misdemeanor. The vehicle search pursuant to the arrest revealed a shotgun and shells, off-premises possession of which in a declared emergency area violated N.C. Gen. Stat. 14-288.7. The court held that: (1) there was reasonable grounds to arrest the defendant without a warrant, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-41; (2) evidence obtained pursuant to the lawful arrest was properly admitted into evidence and was sufficient to support a finding of each element of the weapons offense; (3) consolidation of the two charges for trial was within the trial court's discretion; (4) the defendant's motion for nonsuit and to limit the prosecution's cross-examination of him was properly denied; (5) the Second Amendment argument was not properly raised for appeal; (6) the trial court's denial of the motion to quash the warrants was amply supported; and (7) the curfew imposed under the city's state of emergency was not an unreasonable restraint on liberty and did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment or N.C.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants, The Ervin Company (Ervin) and Crescent Land and Timber Corporation (Crescent) are the owners of a 111.786 acre tract of land (tract) in Sharon Township, Mecklenburg County, lying outside the city limits of the City of Charlotte but lying within the City's zoning perimeter.  The tract is bounded on the west by Providence Road, on the north by Sardis Lane, on the south by McAlpine Creek, and on the east by several of the plaintiffs' properties.  Plaintiffs, with the exception of two persons, adjoin the tract.  The tract owned by defendants was included in a comprehensive zoning ordinance adopted in 1962 which zoned 66 acres adjoining Providence Road, Sardis Lane and McAlpine Creek as R-15MF and zoned 45.126 acres of the tract adjoining McAlpine Creek, Sardis Lane, and the property of several of the plaintiffs in this action as R-15.  The classification&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  R-15 restricts the use of land to single family residences and permits construction of approximately 2.9 units per acre, and requires 15,000 square feet of development area per dwelling unit on a lot 80 feet wide with a side yard of at least 10 feet; the classification R-15MF permits single family houses, duplexes and multi-family buildings and developments.  Charlotte Code &sect; 23-4.  Multi-family units in a R-15MF district must have a minimum lot size of 15,000 square feet for the first building plus 3,500 square feet for each additional building, with at least 65% of the area being open and unobstructed.  Other classifications pertinent to this decision are the classification R-20MF and B-1SCD.  The only uses permitted in R-20MF districts are one-family semi-detached, one-family attached, two-family and multi-family dwellings.  The lot must have an area of at least 20,000 square feet for the first unit and 5,000 square feet for each additional unit, with at least 70% of the area being unobstructed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The B-1SCD classification permits an integrated shopping center and requires a minimum site area of 3 acres per building, requires a separation of 25 feet between buildings when the building&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is under 40 feet in height, requires separation of buildings by 35 feet when the building is between 40 and 60 feet in height.  For buildings over 60 feet, the separated distance shall be 35 feet plus 1 foot for every 2 feet of building height above 60 feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 May 1970 defendants Ervin and Crescent filed a petition requesting that 42.6 acres of the eastern portion of the tract be rezoned.  The notice of hearing was properly published, and in pertinent part provided:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Notice is hereby given that public hearings will be held by the City Council, and the Charlotte-Meckenburg Planning Commission, the Council Chamber, Second Floor of the Charlotte City Hall, on Monday, the 15th day of June, 1970, at 2 o'clock P. M., on the following petitions proposing changes on the official zoning map of the City of Charlotte, N. C. and Perimeter Area:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Petition No. 70-88.

Petitioners: The Ervin Company and Crescent Land and Timber Co.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;The City Council may change the existing zoning classification of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  the entire area covered by each petition, or any part or parts of such area, to the classification requested, or to a higher classification or classifications without the necessity of withdrawal or modification of the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard and may obtain further information on the proposed changes from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission Office, Equity Building, 701 East Trade Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Anyone desiring to file a written petition of protest intended to invoke the 3/4 majority vote rule as specified in G.S. 160-176 must file such petition in the Office of the City Clerk not later than the close of business on June 10, 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;City Clerk,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">Ruth Armstrong&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A protest petition was filed within the time required by G.S. 160-176 by owners of 20% in area of the property adjoining the east side of the tract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Agreed Statement of Case on Appeal contains the following:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;10. The relationship of the boundary of the 111.786 acre tract to the boundary of the area for which zoning reclassification was requested is shown by Sheet 2 of Exhibit A to this Agreed Statement of Case on Appeal and on the east side consists of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  a strip which is uniformly one hundred feet in width and denominated 'Buffer.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The buffer zone skirted the area proposed to be rezoned so that at no point was the property of any of the plaintiffs within 100 feet of the area proposed to be rezoned.  This buffer area was not contained in the area requested for rezoning and remained zoned as classification R-15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 15 June 1970 a joint public hearing was held before the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission and the Charlotte City Council.  At the hearing Ervin and Crescent presented their plans for development of the area proposed for rezoning.  The development plan, in brief summary, proposed a shopping center containing a food store, drug store, florist shop, and other miscellaneous specialty shops.  The shopping center was to be located near the center of the rezoned tract and not on a major thoroughfare.  The proposal called for a lake, common grounds with apartment buildings so placed that they did not face on through streets.  The buffer strip was projected as a landscaped area with only walkways traversing it.  The protestants contended that the proposed rezoning would aggravate the already congested traffic and road&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  conditions, would lower property values in the area, and would in general be detrimental to the public safety, health, morals and welfare of those located in nearby areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the public hearing, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Planning Commission requested Ervin and Crescent to submit a revised site plan reducing the B-1SCD area to 10 acres and increasing the R-20MF area to 31 acres.  Applicants complied, and the Planning Commission thereupon recommended approval of the revised plan to the Charlotte City Council.  After receiving the recommendation, several members of the Charlotte City Council made it known to Ervin that they thought 10 acres was still too large an area to be rezoned B-1SCD, and requested another revision of the site plan reducing B-1SCD area to 7.4 acres, with 1.4 acres of that total being dedicated to development of a lake and greenway.  Applicants thereupon reduced the B-1SCD areas as requested and increased R-20MF area to 32.9 acres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 July 1970, at a regular meeting, held without additional notice or further public hearing, the Charlotte City Council, by vote of five to two, adopted Zoning Ordinance No. 692-Z, which approved classification of 7.4 acres to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B-1SCD and 32.9 acres to R-20MF according to the last revised site plan.  In so doing, the City Council ruled that the filed protest petition did not comply with provisions of G.S. 160-176 requiring three-fourths vote because the 100-foot buffer strip prevented the property owners who filed the petition from being &quot;owners of twenty per cent or more . . . of the area of the lots . . . immediately adjacent either in the rear thereof or on either side thereof, extending one hundred feet therefrom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs thereupon instituted this action seeking to have the ordinance declared void, and at the same time obtained a temporary restraining order preventing use of the property in question other than for uses permitted prior to the adoption of Ordinance No. 692-Z on 13 July 1970.  Defendants Ervin and Crescent filed and served motion for summary judgment.  The motion was heard by Judge Harry C. Martin on 31 August 1970, and on 3 September 1970 Judge Martin entered summary judgment of dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All plaintiffs except George D. Heaton and wife, Emily W. Heaton, appealed from the judgment entered.  The case is now before the Supreme Court pursuant to its general referral order effective 1&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  August 1970.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developers applied to have their land rezoned for mixed commercial and residential use. A notice of hearing was published and the landowners filed a protest petition. The site plan called for a 100-foot buffer zone so that at no point was the landowners' property within 100 feet of the proposed rezoned area. After a public hearing, the developers were requested to revise their site plan. The city council then approved the zoning ordinance. The landowners filed an action to have the ordinance declared void. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendants and the court affirmed the order, holding that the city did not violate N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-176 by not providing additional notice before voting on the ordinance, as the revised site plan resulted in changes favorable to the landowners. The public hearing guided the city council in making changes consistent with the landowners' views, and another hearing would have resulted in repetitive statements. A vote of three-fourths of the city council was not required because the landowners were not qualified protestants under &sect; 160-176 due to the buffer zone between the landowners' property and the land to have been rezoned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiffs from the decision of the Court of Appeals, reported in 8 N.C. App. 595, affirming a judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Exum, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in the Superior Court of Guilford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appeal is from a judgment sustaining a demurrer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ore tenus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the complaint for the reason that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  Pending this appeal the Superior Court continued in effect a restraining order entered contemporaneously with the filing of the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint alleges in substance (numbering revised):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The plaintiffs are retailers of general merchandise, operating business establishments within the corporate limits of the City of High Point and offering for sale therein a wide variety of merchandise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. On 19 August 1965, the City Council of High Point adopted &sect; 15 35 of the Code of Ordinances of the city, which section regulates the business of merchandising within the city.  A copy of this ordinance is attached to and made part of the complaint.  It prohibits from midnight Saturday to midnight Sunday the offering, exposing for sale and sale of merchandise and the opening of a place of business for such sale, unless such place of business is expressly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  exempted in the ordinance.  It further prohibits such exempt business establishments from selling, exposing or offering for sale to the public specified types of merchandise, all of which are customarily sold by the plaintiffs in their respective places of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Types of business establishments exempted by the ordinance include drug stores, curb markets, garages, filling stations and newsstands.  Since the adoption of the ordinance, numerous establishments of these exempted types, with the acquiescence of the executive authorities of the city, charged with the duty of enforcing the ordinance, have regularly offered for sale and sold on Sunday in their respective establishments merchandise of the types forbidden to be sold even in exempted establishments.  Numerous other establishments, not exempted by the ordinance, including the &quot;Pro Shop&quot; maintained upon a golf course owned by the city, pet shops, camping trailer dealers and sporting goods stores, have, with the acquiescence of the city authorities, charged with the duty of enforcing the ordinance, regularly opened their establishments for business on Sunday and have offered for sale therein types of merchandise, the sale&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of which is prohibited even in exempt establishments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Notwithstanding frequent and regular violations of the ordinance, as above set forth, since the adoption of the ordinance on 19 August 1965, warrants have been issued for not more than &quot;approximately three&quot; persons for violating the ordinance by illegal opening of their business establishments or by sale therein of merchandise forbidden to be sold on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. On Sunday, 30 November 1969, plaintiffs opened their respective business establishments and offered therein for sale to the public, between the hours of 1 p.m. and 6 p.m., all types of merchandise generally carried for sale therein.  On that occasion, 42 employees of the plaintiffs were arrested by police officers in a massive deployment of police personnel and were charged with violating the ordinance either by opening the establishment for business or by selling items of merchandise of types prohibited by the ordinance to be sold on Sunday.  By this &quot;invidiously discriminatory&quot; action of the law enforcement authorities of the city, the plaintiffs were compelled to close their business establishments or &quot;face the threat of financial ruin, imprisonment and loss of employees.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  6. The ordinance makes each separate sale or offer to sell a separate violation of the ordinance.  No specific penalty being provided in the ordinance for its violation, &sect; 1-4 of the City Code of Ordinances applies and under it any violation is a misde-meanor, the penalty for which shall not exceed a fine of $ 50.00 or imprisonment for 30 days.  Each of the plaintiffs carries for sale an inventory of more than 100,000 items of merchandise prohibited by the ordinance to be sold on Sunday.  By opening for business, contrary to the prohibition of the ordinance, the plaintiffs and their employees risk penalties of 30 days imprisonment for sale of each item of merchandise, so that the cumulative penalties which could be imposed under the ordinance are &quot;so enormous and severe as to prohibit plaintiffs from doing business on Sunday pending a judicial construction of the ordinance.&quot; The enforcement provisions of the ordinance are unconstitutional upon their face, being violative of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Art. I, &sect; 17, of the Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The ordinance does not define &quot;drug store.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Drug stores in the City of High Point are, in fact, general merchandise stores, as are the stores of the plaintiffs.  They sell regularly, including sales on Sunday, hardware, electrical appliances, articles of clothing, housewares and tools.  The plaintiffs, in their stores, also offer for sale these types of articles.  The classification which the ordinance attempts to make is unreasonable, arbitrary, not consistent with the facts, and oppressive in that it discriminates within a class between competitors similarly situated.  The ordinance permits, by its failure to prohibit the same, cosmetics, firearms and ammunition to be sold on Sunday in exempt stores.  Permitting the sale of these articles has no reasonable relation to the public peace, welfare, safety and morals and discriminates against the plaintiffs who, as general retailers, sell the same types of merchandise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. From the date of the adoption of the ordinance to the present time, the city authorities, charged with the enforcement of the ordinance, have intentionally, purposely, unjustly and illegally discriminated between plaintiffs and their competitors by selective enforcement of the referenced Sunday closing ordinance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  against plaintiffs and their employees while openly permitting violations of said ordinance by competitors and their employees, both as said ordinance applies to non-exempt businesses and as it applies to exempt businesses selling items, the sale of which is prohibited on Sundays.  This is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and a violation of the Constitution of North Carolina, Art. I, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The damage and injury done to the plaintiffs by reason of such deprivation of their rights is continuing and irreparable due to the existence of the ordinance and the discriminatory enforcement thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayer of the complaint is that the ordinance be declared in violation of the Constitution of the United States and of the Constitution of North Carolina and void, and that a preliminary and a permanent injunction be issued restraining the defendants and their employees from enforcing the ordinance.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Reversed and remanded.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff department store sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which affirmed a judgment sustaining a demurrer ore tenus to the store's complaint requesting that defendant city be enjoined from enforcing a Sunday closing ordinance. Pending the appeal the trial court continued in effect a restraining order, which the city sought to have vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The store had alleged that the city's Sunday closing ordinance violated the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, because other stores which sold similar products were exempt from the closing requirements, and because the ordinance was being enforced against the store but not against other non-exempt stores. The court held that the ordinance was facially valid. However, the court held that the demurrer was improperly sustained because the store had alleged in its complaint facts which, if true, would entitle it to injunctive relief, because discriminatory enforcement such as that alleged would violate the store's right to equal protection of the laws. Therefore, the court reversed the intermediate appellate court's decision. However, the court also vacated the restraining order because the city had the authority to enforce, in a constitutional manner, the ordinance in question, and the past discriminatory enforcement practices alleged in the complaint, if true, did not render the ordinance void or unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment affirming the sustaining of the demurrer, but also granted the city's motion to vacate the restraining order.</SPAN></P>

The Southern Railway Company appealed from the assessment.  The parties stipulated certain facts, waived a jury trial and consented for the Court to try the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing, Judge Bailey on March 3, 1970 found these facts:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 839, which provided that a municipality was not to assess a railroad right-of-way property for local improvement unless there was a building on the right-of-way.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint alleges the levy and collection of the tax are illegal and discriminatory, in violation of the plaintiff's rights under Article I, Sections 17 and 31; Article II, Section 29; Article V, Sections 3 and 5 of the North Carolina Constitution, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint and the brief allege the particulars in which the tax exacted from the plaintiff under Chapter 1228 violates its constitutional rights.  The sum of $ 436.41 was exacted from the plaintiff as a sales and use tax when the sale and delivery were made in counties which did not levy the tax.  The plaintiff, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a dealer in a taxing county, was forced to pay the tax in all counties of the State when its competitors living in nontaxing counties are not required to pay any tax in any county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporate taxpayer argued that the levy and collection of the sales and use tax was illegal and discriminatory and violated various rights under the constitution. The corporate taxpayer, dealing in a taxing county, was forced to pay the tax in all counties of the state when its competitors living in non-taxing counties were not required to pay any tax in any county. Specifically, the corporate taxpayer charged that the tax, which it was required to pay, deprived it of its property without due process of law, in violation of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The court reversed the judgment because it was evident that the state had set up the taxing scheme. The taxes involved were levied by the general assembly. The county did not take part or perform any function whatever in the levying or the collection of the taxes. All functions incident to the collection of the tax were given to the commissioner of revenue. Therefore, the levy discriminated against the corporate taxpayer because it was required to pay the tax involved and it exempted his competitor in a county, which voted against the tax. There was no uniformity with the application and levying of the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c1"><SPAN CLASS="c4">December 16, 1970, Filed </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal from the judgment of the District Court of Catawba County at its 18 May 1970 Session, heard prior to determination by the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Town of Conover sued to enjoin the defendants from keeping and maintaining a mobile home upon certain premises in the town and to compel them to remove from such premises the mobile home located thereon.  The matter was heard in the district court upon an agreed statement of facts.  The injunctive relief sought was denied on the ground that the ordinance, relied upon by the plaintiff, is unconstitutional.  The town appealed, assigning as error this conclusion of law and the entry of the judgment denying relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stipulated facts include the following (numbering revised):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. For the purported purpose of promoting the health, safety and general welfare of the community, the town adopted an ordinance which, after defining &quot;Trailer&quot; to include a mobile home, mounted on wheels or dismounted and placed upon masonry or other stationary foundation, used or designed for use as permanent or semi-permanent living or sleeping quarters, provides:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">Prohibitions</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">.  It shall be unlawful for any person * * * to place * * * any trailer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  or to make use of any trailer, subject to those exceptions hereinafter specifically enumerated, on any premises within the corporate limits of the town * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The only exceptions contained in the ordinance relate to a trailer placed on a construction site and used for office or storage purposes so long as construction is in process, a trailer placed on a school or church site and used for school or classroom purposes, and a trailer placed in a business, industrial or neigh-borhood trading district or area and used for office purposes in connection with the operation of a business, political or charitable activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The ordinance further provides that it does not affect or repeal any law of the town regarding location of trailers or mobile homes in residential areas on a temporary permit issued by the Board of Commissioners.  (The record does not set forth any other ordinance of the town providing for the issuance of such temporary permits but, in oral argument of the appeal, the Court was advised that the town does have such an ordinance and copies of temporary permits, referred to below, issued by the town to the defendant Ruby Jolly have, by stipulation of counsel, been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  added to the record upon appeal.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The town also has enacted a zoning ordinance.  The ordinance here in question is not made a part thereof and is not denominated a zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The town has a population of over 3,000 and has residential, general business, neighborhood trading, manufacturing and minor farming areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The defendants are the owners or entitled to the possession of a lot in the town, designated as 421 Fourth Street Place, which lot is in an area zoned for &quot;neighborhood trading&quot; and adjoins areas zoned for &quot;industrial&quot; and for &quot;residential&quot; use by the town's zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. On 6 March 1967, the defendant Ruby Jolly applied for and was granted a temporary permit to place one mobile home upon this lot for six months, beginning 6 March 1967.  This permit was renewed for two succeeding six months periods.  The last renewal of the permit expired prior to the commencement of this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Pursuant to such permit, Ruby Jolly placed upon the lot a mobile home with the consent of the defendants Foy Jolly and Odessa P. Jolly, the owners of the lot.  It is of good, substantial material, has two bedrooms, a bath, and adequate plumbing, heating and electric&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  facilities.  It is presently being used as the residence of Ruby Jolly and has been so used since it was placed upon the property.  The defendants have been notified to cease using the lot for the location thereon of a mobile home as a dwelling place.  Their continuing to so use it is a violation of the ordinance if the ordinance is valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. &quot;[S]ome modern mobile homes of current manufacture when placed on suitable lots within the Town of Conover, in a suitable manner, with adequate water, sewage, electrical, and other utilities would not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">per se</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> be a hazard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not stipulated that &sect; 12-22 of the ordinance bears any substantial relationship to public health, safety or welfare.  This is denied in the further answer of the defendants, they alleging therein that the ordinance &quot;is unconstitutional and void as an arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory exercise of the police power.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The town sought the injunction on the basis of an ordinance that prohibited any owner of a well constructed mobile home, completely equipped for safe, sanitary, healthful occupancy, to use it anywhere in the town for the purpose for which it was designed and purchased. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance was not an exercise of the zoning power conferred upon cities and towns under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-172 et seq. The court reasoned that because mobile homes were not nuisances per se and were not detrimental to the health, morals, comfort, safety, or welfare of the people, the town had no authority to have enacted the ordinance at issue.</SPAN></P>

Four days after they had filed their application with the board of adjustment, the commissioners adopted a resolution that it would hear all requests for special exceptions under the Guilford County Zoning Ordinance.

The preamble recites that the Ordinance was adopted pursuant to the power conferred by G.S. 153-9(55), which is a codification of Chapter 36, Session Laws of 1969, entitled, &quot;An Act Granting Ordinance-Making Authority to Counties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ordinance, which was to become effective on February 1, 1970, in part provides: &quot;It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, offer or expose for sale, any goods, wares or merchandise in the County of Cumberland on Sunday, nor shall any store, shop, warehouse or any other place of business in which goods, wares, or merchandise are kept for sale, be kept open between 12:00 o'clock midnight Saturday and 12:00 o'clock&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  midnight Sunday, unless such store, shop, warehouse or other place of business is expressly allowed to open and sell goods under the provisions of this article; . . .&quot; It is not applicable &quot;within the corporate limits or jurisdiction of any municipality in the County of Cumberland that has conducted the most recent election required by its charter or the general law, whichever is applicable, unless the governing body thereof shall, by resolution, agree to such ordinance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs operate &quot;self-service retail merchandising discount department stores&quot; in Cumberland County outside of the corporate limits and jurisdiction of any municipality.  On Sunday, from 1:00 to 6:00 p.m., they engage in the business of selling goods, wares and merchandise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enforcement of the Ordinance was restrained temporarily by orders entered January 29, 1970, and February 13, 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause was heard at the March 2, 1970 Session on defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and for summary judgment.  After consideration of the pleadings, the stipulations, and affidavits offered by plaintiffs, Judge McKinnon entered an order in which he adjudged the Ordinance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;to be constitutional and in all respects valid&quot; and dissolved &quot;the Preliminary Injunction.&quot; Plaintiffs excepted and appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By supplemental order, Judge McKinnon, in the exercise of the discretion vested in him by G.S. 1-500 and Rule 62(c) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, enjoined enforcement of the Ordinance &quot;pending a final determination of this cause.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff discount department stores appealed a judgment of the Cumberland County Superior Court (North Carolina), which refused to permanently enjoin the enforcement of an ordinance adopted by defendant board of commissioners. The ordinance provided that it was unlawful for the stores to offer for sale any goods in the county on Sunday unless expressly allowed under the article.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 153-9(55) (1969) conferred on the board of commissioners of every county, for the better government of the county, the power to adopt ordinances in exercising its general police power. Predicated on the proposition that the commissioners had no inherent legislative powers, the stores asserted that &sect; 153-9(55) did not confer on the commissioners the authority to enact Sunday observance ordinances. The stores contended that the omission from the 1969 amendment of the statute of an explicit reference to Sunday laws indicated that the general assembly did not intend the commissioners to have the power to enact Sunday observance ordinances. They also asserted that the statute was a local act in contravention of N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 29. The court upheld the judgment against the stores. The statute did not confer or withhold authority in respect of specific activities. It conferred authority to enact ordinances in the exercise of the general police power. The statute was a Home Rule statute, applicable throughout the State. The court held that the statute was a general law and did not contravene N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 29.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court declaring the ordinance to be constitutional. The supplemental order that granted a temporary restraining order to the stores was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Clark, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, November 1969 Criminal Session of Robeson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged in separate bills of indictment with felonious escape, kidnapping, and first degree murder.  A codefendant, Ricardo Zimmerle Resendez, similarly charged in separate indictments, was tried jointly with Lee but did not appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that Jimmy Lee and Ricardo Resendez were serving sentences for felony convictions at the Robeson County Prison Unit.  On the morning of June 2, 1969, during the cleanup detail when there was only one armed guard immediately present, Resendez called to an unarmed guard named Boyd Strickland who walked from his position on the front walk to the door of the prison dormitory.  When he entered the doorway, Resendez held a .22 caliber pistol on him and demanded that he call the superintendent.  Boyd Strickland refused.  Resendez then demanded that he summon a guard named Earl C. Strickland (Earl) who was outside the dormitory at the time, and Boyd complied.  As Earl C. Strickland, who was armed, neared the doorway of the dormitory Resendez shoved Boyd out of his way and told defendant Jimmy Lee to get him.  Jimmy Lee, who had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been present throughout the foregoing hiatus, grabbed Boyd, putting a knife to his throat and locking Boyd's arm behind his back.  Resendez jumped out the door and tried to disarm Officer Earl C. Strickland before he reached the door to the dormitory.  Both Earl C. Strickland and Resendez were trying to get Earl's gun which was still in its holster.  They scuffled and during the ensuing struggle Resendez fired the .22 caliber pistol into Earl C. Strickland's chest resulting in his death.  During the struggle defendant Jimmy Lee was inside the dormitory holding a knife to the throat of Boyd Strickland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After herding several guards into the dormitory and changing into non-prison attire, Resendez and Lee took Sergeant Ebert Locklear hostage, commandeered a car from the parking lot, and forced Locklear to drive them away.  They were armed with Resendez' .22 caliber pistol, a .38 caliber revolver taken from the slain guard Earl C. Strickland, and Sergeant Locklear's 30-30 rifle.  Sergeant Locklear made various turns at the direction of Resendez and later drove the car into the woods.  There defendant Lee held a gun on Sergeant Locklear while Resendez bound him.  Leaving the bound hostage&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the car, the two men camouflaged the car and proceeded on foot to a nearby house occupied by the Isley Wilcox family.  They entered the house and held the family hostage for almost twenty-four hours before voluntarily surrendering.  No member of the Wilcox family was harmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial Jimmy Lee offered no evidence.  Ricardo Resendez, testifying in his own behalf, stated that he had acquired the .22 caliber pistol several days before he made his break but refused to reveal where he got it.  He said he did not know where Lee got the knife that he used and that he had never seen it before; that he did not know Lee was coming with him; that at one time he told Lee to stay out of it but &quot;[h]e just decided at the last minute to come along . . . Jimmy hardly said anything.  He acted more like a spectator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found both Lee and Resendez guilty of murder in the first degree with a recommendation of life imprisonment, and guilty of felonious escape.  Both men were acquitted on the kidnapping charge.  Defendant Lee appealed from a sentence of life imprisonment pronounced on the murder charge and a consecutive sentence of two years pronounced on the escape charge, assigning errors&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  noted in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Criminal Session of Robeson (North Carolina), which convicted defendant of murder after co-defendant shot and killed a guard during a prison escape. In seeking review, defendant claimed the trial court had erred by denying defendant the right to make the closing argument to the jury, giving improper jury instructions on conspiracy, and making prejudicial expressions of opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Co-defendant shot and killed a guard while escaping from prison with defendant. After being captured, defendant and co-defendant were convicted of felony murder, and accordingly, defendant sought review. In affirming, the court held the closing argument had belonged to the state, even though defendant had not offered evidence, because co-defendant had offered evidence. After upholding the constitutionality of the single verdict procedure in capital cases, the court also held the jury had been properly instructed that defendant could be found guilty of murder on the theory of conspiracy. In so holding, the court found the evidence had pointed unerringly to the conclusion that defendant and co-defendant had conspired to escape prior to the murder. Furthermore, the court rejected the contention that the trial judge had violated N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-180 by expressing an opinion on the evidence because the trial judge's challenged statement, when considered contextually and without isolation, had not been prejudicial. Finally, because defendant had failed to object, the court refused to consider defendant's claim that the trial court had erred in construing defendant's contentions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, a resident of North Carolina, instituted this action for breach of contract against defendant, a Texas corporation not licensed to do business in North Carolina.  Pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 55-145(a) (1) and G.S. 55-146, the complaint and summons were served on the Secretary of State on 11 March 1969 and were duly forwarded by letter to the defendant at its principal office in Dallas, Texas, by registered mail, return receipt requested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the September 8, 1969 Civil Session of Superior Court of Guilford County, Greensboro Division, defendant made a special appearance before the Honorable Robert A. Collier, Jr., Judge Presiding, and moved to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction; to quash the summons and to set aside the attempted service of summons on the ground that the court had not acquired jurisdiction over the defendant since defendant was a foreign corporation not doing business in North Carolina, and for the reason the contract out of which the plaintiff's cause of action arises was not made in North Carolina and there was no substantial performance under the contract in North Carolina. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The court considered the verified complaint, the affidavits or Ira Orenstein, vice president of defendant corporation; Artie W.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant corporation challenged an order of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which affirmed the trial court's order that denied the corporation's motion to dismiss plaintiff distributor's breach of contract action for lack of personal jurisdiction over the corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation had made a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. The corporation argued that the service of summons on it, a foreign corporation unlicensed to do business in North Carolina, by service on the secretary of state in accordance with the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 55-146(a)(b) was invalid, and the application of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 55-145(a)(1) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the order that denied the dismissal. The court held that the contract, the alleged breach of which was the subject of the action, was made in North Carolina in that the corporation sent the contract to the distributor in North Carolina, the distributor signed the contract in North Carolina, and the distributor mailed the contract in North Carolina. Further, the distributor solicited business for the corporation in North Carolina. Accordingly, the contract clearly met the requirement of &quot;substantial connection&quot; with North Carolina and the trial court's assumption of in personam jurisdiction over the corporation fully met the requirements of due process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action is for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff-taxpayer alleges that Chapter 1235, Session Laws of 1969, referred to hereafter as the 1969 Act, which provides for the creation of &quot;a body politic and corporate to be known as the 'North Carolina Housing Corporation,'&quot; and defines its authority, is unconstitutional and therefore void.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pleadings establish these facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff is a citizen and resident of Northampton County, North Carolina.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The individual defendants are officials of the State of North Carolina in the capacities set forth in the caption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Corporation was created as a public agency, an instrumentality of the State of North Carolina, and empowered to act on behalf of the State of North Carolina for the purpose of providing residential housing &quot;for sale or rental to persons and families of lower income.&quot; (1969 Act, s. 2.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants, under color of their respective offices, are about to transfer to the Corporation the $ 500,000.00 appropriated from the General Fund of the State by Chapter 1162, Session Laws of 1965, for the fiscal years 1969-1970 and 1970-1971, or a portion thereof, to enable the Corporation &quot;to further organize and pay the expenses of its administration during the first two years of the Corporation's operation,&quot; and that these and such additional funds as may be appropriated will be used by the Corporation for purposes enumerated in the 1969 Act.</SPAN></P>

The principal of and the interest on any such fund notes shall be payable solely from the Housing Development Fund.&quot; (1969 Act, s. 7.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was stipulated and agreed that the court, without a jury, should hear the evidence, make findings of fact and conclusions of law and enter judgment.  Thereupon, the parties submitted a Stipulation of Facts, referred to hereafter as the Stipulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional facts established by the Stipulation are summarized or quoted below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Paragraph 8, the twenty-one specific powers which Section 5 of the 1969 Act purports to confer on the Corporation are quoted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  verbatim.  It was stipulated that the Corporation proposed to exercise each and all of these powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Paragraph 9, it was stipulated that the Corporation proposed to carry out the following program:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(a) to issue self-liquidating tax exempt housing revenue bonds to be sold as tax exempt securities in the national bond market, with the approval of the Local Government Commission, up to a maximum of two hundred million dollars, and more if needed and if permitted by amendment to the statute;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(b) to use the money obtained for the purchase of federal insured mortgage and construction loans, for establishing working agreements with private financial institutions such as banks, savings and loans, and mortgage brokers whereby the individual borrower would make application through the private lending institution and the private lending institution would service the mortgage for a fee in behalf of the Corporation.  The private institution would receive a service fee in the range of one-half percent, and would forward monthly payments to the Corporation.  The Corporation would pay the bondholders on its loans and would from time to time sell mortgages to investors;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(c) to operate in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this manner, the Corporation proposes to market its bonds at an interest rate lower than it receives, and thereby have a sufficient margin to pay for some of its expenses and losses;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(d) to establish a special revolving fund known as the Housing Development Fund, administered as a separate trust fund funded from gifts, grants and loans from industries, foundations and government with a total capitalization of five million dollars, with the fund maintained on a business level with interest payable, when earned and with some agreement for the repayment of principal for said loans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Paragraph 10, it was stipulated that the Housing Development Fund, created and established by Section 7 of the 1969 Act would be used for the following three purposes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(a) Providing project development loans (seed money) to builders, sponsors and developers of residential housing for lower income families.  These loans would cover such preconstruction activities as site engineering, preliminary architectural drawing, land options and legal fees, and this money would be repaid from construction loans or mortgage proceeds; these costs should not exceed five percent of the final cost of a dwelling unit; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;(b) providing (through loans) down-payment assistance to needy, but otherwise qualified families seeking to purchase a home.  The down-payment assistance would help young wage earners, and others who lack the down-payment, where prudent business practices justify this assistance with a limit in the range of $ 300.00 per family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(c) providing uninsured loans in part with private lenders to builders and developers for land development and residential construction for lower income families.  This program would assist small builders who cannot obtain funds at a reasonable interest rate in the market for subdivision development.  The private lender would participate in this program to an extent of at least twenty (20%) percent of the total loan, on subdivisions that meet minimum design requirements, where housing would qualify for mortgage insurance programs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Paragraph 11, it was stipulated that &quot;(t)he Corporation will use the $ 500,000.00 appropriation to cover administrative cost during the first two years, and to establish the bond contingency fund&quot;; and that &quot;(d)uring the first two years it will be necessary for the Corporation to establish a pattern and history of operation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to assure that its bonds and other obligations meet a favorable reception in the market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Paragraph 12, it was stipulated that &quot;(t)he Corporation proposes to help overcome the shortage of adequate housing by making financial assistance available where private funds are not available, in the range of lower income families, and using the existing framework of private financing and construction industries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paragraph 13 provides: &quot;The interest rate charged for private loans for residential housing has increased substantially in recent years.  A federally guaranteed loan for a single family dwelling was in the range of six (6%) percent in 1965, seven (7%) percent in 1967, and eight (8%) percent in 1969.  Conventional loans for single family residential housing are not available for over eighty (80%) percent of the purchase price in most cases, and such loans are in the same general range of interest as those which are federally insured.  At the same time, the Local Government Commission of North Carolina has experienced a substantial increase in interest rates for municipal bonds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paragraph 14 provides: &quot;On the basis of the Municipal Bond Buyers' Index, which is similar in the field&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of municipal bonds to the Dow-Jones Average in the field of corporate stocks, the average national interest rate for revenue bonds, which is closely paralleled in the case of North Carolina revenue bonds, was 4.56% in 1965, 5.45% in 1967 and 7.88% in 1969.  Because of interest rate ceilings by reason of either legislative restrictions or limitations imposed by certain municipal governing bodies, there are cases in which the North Carolina Local Government Commission has recently been unable to find a ready market for certain North Carolina Local Governmental revenue bonds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paragraph 15 provides: &quot;The State of North Carolina has found a better market for its general obligation bonds, with an average interest rate of 3.56% in 1965, 4.45% in 1967 and 6.88% in 1969.  It is readily observable that revenue bonds ordinarily command an interest rate which will be 1% per year higher than general obligation governmental bonds.  Revenue bonds of the North Carolina Housing Corporation could not be marketed at as favorable an interest rate, from the State's point of view, as general obligation bonds of the State.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Paragraph 16, it was stipulated that the Corporation had taken the following&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  action:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(a) That the Corporation held an organizational meeting in October, 1969, in the City of Raleigh, North Carolina, that the members of the Corporation have taken an oath of office, and that they are now acting and the Corporation has a Chairman, Vice Chairman, and acting Secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(b) That the Corporation has employed the Honorable Joe E. Eagles of Edgecombe County to serve as Executive Director and, in such capacity, he has established an office for the transaction of the business of the Corporation.  The Corporation has employed necessary personnel and the Corporation is undertaking to carry out the program authorized by the General Assembly in the creation of the Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(c) That in carrying out its function, the Corporation has already expended a very small portion of the $ 500,000.00 of the General Fund appropriation provided for it by Chapter 1162 of the Session Laws of 1969, to pay salaries of Corporation employees, purchase office equipment and supplies, defray necessary travel expenses while engaged in the business of the Corporation and to take other preliminary steps in making preparation for issuing bonds pursuant to the provisions of the Act creating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Corporation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paragraph 17 refers to attached Exhibit A, a two-page document designated as &quot;Table 9: INADEQUATE HOUSING IN NORTH CAROLINA COUNTIES, 1960,&quot; based on 1960 reports of the United States Census, indicating housing units in this State which are either structurally unsound or lacking adequate plumbing facilities.  Quoting from Paragraph 17: &quot;Table 9 (Column 3) shows that the percentage of such housing units ranges from a low of 20.6% (Dare) to a high of 72.8% (North-ampton).  In terms of absolute numbers, Dare has the fewest such units (835), Guilford the most (20,526).  Besides Dare, seven other counties rate below 30%: Durham, Forsyth, Guilford, Mecklenburg, New Hanover, Onslow, and Wake.  At the other extreme, 33 counties have over 60% of their housing units unsound or lacking in adequate plumbing facilities; some are in the mountain counties, but the largest concentration is in the eastern half of the State.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paragraph 18 refers to attached Exhibit B, a one-page document which shows annual salary ranges of mortgagors in North Carolina with FHA secured mortgages, which figures were compiled by Harold Albright, Assistant Regional Administrator for FHA.  Quoting from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Paragraph 18: &quot;These figures indicate, among other things, that 91.5% of the mortgagors with new homes earn an annual salary of $ 7,000.00 or more.  Mortgagors who earn an average annual salary of less than $ 6,000.00 constitute only 2.6% of such mortgagors with new homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paragraph 19 refers to attached Exhibit C, a seventeen-page pamphlet entitled, &quot;North Carolina Housing Corporation,&quot; which has been issued by the Corporation and sets forth a description of the Corporation, its inception, its purposes, its method of operation, and other matters relating to the Act in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paragraph 20 states that the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development has a program intended to enable lower income families to become home owners, and refers to attached Exhibit D, a document entitled, &quot;Home Ownership for Low Income Families, October, 1968,&quot; indicating that some housing programs are available to citizens of low income, families of marginal credit, and for families who need assistance payments and other forms of aid.  Quoting from Paragraph 20: &quot;Federal funds are also available through VA and FHA insured loans, Farmers Home Administration loans in rural areas in small communities, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and through public housing programs.  Federal funds afford citizens of low income an opportunity to rent apartments with rent subsidy, or other plans of aid, and federal funds also permit some projects in which citizens of low income can lease-purchase and eventually own single family houses of good quality as illustrated by Apollo Heights, Raleigh, North Carolina, in which about two hundred (200) homes were occupied during 1969.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Paragraph 21, it was stipulated: &quot;Housing needs are changing and housing techniques are changing.  In 1969, about twenty (20%) percent of the single family units were mobile home types, being marketed in the range of $ 5,000.00 to $ 8,000.00, plus finance charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Paragraph 22, it was stipulated: &quot;Private construction has steadily increased year after year, and federal programs have expanded rapidly, but there is still a substantial need in North Carolina for improved housing, either public or private, for thousands of North Carolina families whose annual income is in the lower twenty-five (25%) percent.  Many of the houses now being occupied lack suitable accommodations for the health of the occupant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Paragraph 23, it was stipulated that attached&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Exhibit E, a copy of the 1969 Act, was enacted by the General Assembly upon the strong urging of the Governor.  Quoting from Paragraph 23: &quot;North Carolina has not previously been active in this field, other than providing enabling legislation and regulations for local communities to establish public housing organizations.  A few states have undertaken a similar program, but there is insufficient evidence to evaluate the success of such a program in other areas of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Stipulation, after setting forth these factual matters, states and presents for determination the following six questions of law, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">viz.:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. &quot;Does the Act authorize the use of public funds for other than a public purpose in violation of Section 3 of Article V or Section 17 of Article I of the North Carolina Constitution or Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. &quot;Does the Act authorize the lending of the credit of the State in violation of Section 6 of Article VII or Section 4 of Article V of the North Carolina Constitution?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. &quot;Does the Act provide for a delegation of legislative authority in violation of Section 8 of Article I of the North Carolina Constitution?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IV. &quot;Does the Act authorize the creation of a debt in violation of Section 6 of Article VII or Section 4 of Article V of the North Carolina Constitution?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">V. &quot;Does the Act exempt property from taxation in violation of Section 5 of Article V of the North Carolina Constitution?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VI. &quot;Does the Act violate basic due process, and basic public purpose, in the broad constitutional sense, by permitting an agency of the State of North Carolina to engage in a function that is reserved to private enterprise under our system of government, and does said Act constitute a complete departure from the constitutional provisions for the government and taxation within the State of North Carolina?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court, after adopting as its Findings of Fact the facts set forth in the Stipulation, concluded as a matter of law that the 1969 Act is unconstitutional on each and all of the grounds on which it is challenged by plaintiff, and entered judgment as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That the North Carolina Housing Corporation is hereby restrained from issuing tax exempt revenue bonds, and it is hereby adjudged that Chapter 1235, Session Laws of 1969, is an unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Act of the General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. That said Corporation may not lawfully receive any of the unexpended funds of the sum of $ 500,000.00 of public funds appropriated for fiscal year 1969-1971 by the General Assembly of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. That the individual defendants as officials of the State of North Carolina, and their successors in office, are hereby restrained from transmitting any of the unexpended funds of said $ 500,000.00 appropriation of public funds to said corporate defendant, North Carolina Housing Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. That the relief sought by the plaintiff be and it is in all respects allowed, and all of said defendants shall forever cease from said unlawful and unconstitutional action, as heretofore set forth in this judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. That the cost of this action be taxed against the plaintiff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants excepted to each of the court's legal conclusions, and to the judgment, and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, North Carolina Housing Corporation (Corporation) and state officials, challenged a decision of the Special Civil Session of Wake Superior Court (North Carolina), which concluded that 1969 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 1235, N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 122A (1969 Cum. Supp.) (1969 Act), was unconstitutional and granted plaintiff taxpayer an injunction to prevent the Corporation from issuing tax exempt revenue bonds and from receiving public funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The general assembly passed the 1969 Act that established the Corporation as a public agency to provide low income residential housing. The 1969 Act authorized the Corporation to issue tax exempt revenue bonds and to receive and spend public funds. The taxpayer alleged that the 1969 Act was unconstitutional and sought to enjoin the state officials from transferring public funds to the Corporation. The trial court issued the injunction. The court reversed, vacated the injunction, and dismissed the complaint. The court held that the 1969 Act was enacted for a public purpose, that the Corporation's authorized activities were for a public purpose, and that the general assembly properly exempted the Corporation's property and obligations from taxation because its activities were for a public purpose. The court held that the 1969 Act was not unconstitutional on its face and violated neither N.C. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6, nor N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 4. The court held that the Corporation did not legislate but factually determined, by application of the factors the general assembly prescribed, who were &quot;persons and families of lower income&quot; that were entitled to the benefits of the 1969 Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's decision that found the 1969 Act unconstitutional, vacated the injunction issued by the trial court, and dismissed the taxpayer's action against the Corporation and state officials.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Bailey, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at February 9, 1970 Civil Session of Wake Superior Court, certified, pursuant to G.S. 7A-31, for review by the Supreme Court before determination by the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action is for a declaratory judgment, G.S. 1-253&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, determinative of the validity of $ 1,500,000.00 of Revenue Bonds, Series B, consisting of 1,500 bonds of $ 1,000.00 each, issued by the State Education Assistance Authority (Authority).  North Carolina banks offered to purchase the entire issue of $ 1,500,000.00 at par and accrued interest.  The offers included that of the Bank of Statesville for the purchase of three $ 1,000.00 bonds.  The Bank of Statesville is ready, able and willing to accept and pay for these bonds if and when they are adjudged valid; otherwise, it refuses to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Authority was created and constituted &quot;a political subdivision of the State&quot; by Chapter 1180, Session Laws of 1965, referred to hereafter as the 1965 Act.  (The provisions of the 1965 Act were designated G.S. 116-201 through G.S. 116-209).  The 1965 Act provided: &quot;The exercise by the Authority of the powers conferred by this Act shall be deemed and held to be the performance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of an essential governmental function.&quot; G.S. 116-203.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapter 1177, Session Laws of 1967, referred to hereafter as Chapter 1177, amended the 1965 Act, &quot;being G.S. 116-201 to 116-209 of the 1965 Cumulative Supplement,&quot; by adding at the end thereof sections designated G.S. 116-209.1 through G.S. 116-209.15.  Chapter 1177 authorized the Authority to issue student loan revenue bonds in an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time not exceeding $ 12,500,000.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was submitted to Judge Bailey on an agreed statement of facts which, in addition to matters set forth above, contained the provisions quoted (with immaterial deletions) below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. At the present time, a large number of North Carolina residents are, as students, pursuing educational courses beyond the public school level; that the educational facilities of the State and of private institutions in this State and throughout the country have been greatly enlarged and expanded to meet the needs for the education of a greater number of students seeking education beyond the level of the public school system; that to meet the cost of their education, many students are in need of money and are borrowing funds to pay for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  their education, generally upon terms which provide for repayment after the completion of their education; that sufficient loan funds are not available through the normal channels of commercial lending and financing to meet this need of North Carolina residents; nor are student loans attractive to commercial lenders because the students seeking loans usually are persons who are not fully in income producing situations, and furthermore, the commencement of repayment of principal is deferred; that without moneys which can be made available to needy students through the State's student loan program administered by the Authority, and financed through the issuance by the Authority of student loan revenue bonds, many of these North Carolina Students will not be able to complete their formal education, or pursue educational courses beyond the public school level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. That acting under and by virtue of the provisions of Chapter 1177 . . . the Authority has acquired and is purchasing student loan obligations made pursuant to the Authority's commitments to purchase said obligations, said 'student loans' being those which have enabled North Carolina students to continue their education&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in 'eligible institutions' as these terms are defined in G.S. 116-209.2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6. Acting pursuant to said Chapter 1177, the Authority did on August 29, 1968, adopt a bond resolution (Exhibit A) providing for the issuance and sale of a series of bonds designated as Series 'A' Bonds in the total sum of $ 3,000,000.00, . . . that the Authority sold the Series 'A' Bonds to investors through its Fiscal Agent, Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Company, N.A., pursuant to a contract (Exhibit B) between the Authority, Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Company, N.C., and College Foundation, Inc., dated August 29, 1968, . . . under which Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Company, N.A., as Fiscal Agent, (hereinafter referred to as 'Fiscal Agent') undertook the duties of consummating the sale of the bonds to bidders whose proposals had been accepted by the Authority, disbursing of bond proceeds to purchase student loans, and administering of bond revenues for the Authority; and under which same contract, the Authority agreed to purchase and did purchase certain student loans of North Carolina residents from College Foundation, Inc., said loans having been made to enable North Carolina residents to pursue their education in 'eligible&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  institutions'; and that College Foundation, Inc., agreed to sell and did sell certain student loan obligations to the Authority and agreed to administer the collection of these student loans for the Authority, and to remit the proceeds to the Authority's Fiscal Agent, Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Company, N.A., as is more fully set out in Exhibit B; that the $ 3,000,000.00 realized from the sale of its Series 'A' Bonds was fully expended by the Authority in accordance with the bond resolution during the school year 1968-1969.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;7. The Authority's Bond Resolution of August 29, 1968 (Exhibit A) in addition to providing for the initial issue, provided for additional series of bonds to be issued to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time not exceeding $ 12,500,000.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;8. For the school year 1969-1970, the Authority determined that additional loan funds, which would not otherwise be available were needed by North Carolina students, during this school year in at least the amount of $ 1,500,000.00; and upon making this determination and finding, the Authority then proceeded with the issuance of additional student loan revenue bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;9. On the 21st day of August, 1969, at a meeting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  duly called and held in its offices in Raleigh, North Carolina, the Authority adopted a resolution (Exhibit C) . . . providing for the issuance under authority of Chapter 1177 . . . and of its bond resolution of August 29, 1968 (Exhibit A), of a series of bonds, designated as its Series 'B' Revenue Bonds, in the total amount of $ 1,500,000.00, in units of One Thousand Dollars, to bear interest at the rate of five and one-half (5 1/2%) percent; and it further, by resolution (Exhibit D), authorized execution of and there was duly executed a supplemental tripartite agreement (Exhibit E) with its Fiscal Agent, Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Company, N.A., and College Foundation, Inc., for sale and expenditure and administration of the bond proceeds . . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. . . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;11. . . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;12. The funds which were realized by the Authority from the sale of its Series 'B' Bonds have been used or are committed for use prior to the close of the academic year 1969-70 in purchasing loans made to 2,140 students, with the average loan being in the amount of approximately $ 700.00; that in addition to the loans which were made with these funds, 1,039 applications were rejected by College Foundation, Inc., &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of which number one-half would have received favorable action if sufficient additional loan funds had been available; that in addition to those loans made or loan applications rejected by College Foundation, Inc., a survey of the Authority, as to loan needs of North Carolina residents for the academic year 1969-1970, indicates that 2,069 students in 'eligible institutions,' as that term is defined in G.S. 116-209.2, expressed to these institutions a need for loans with which to continue their education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;13. . . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;14. . . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;15. College Foundation, Inc., is a North Carolina nonprofit public educational service corporation organized and operating for the purpose of making loans to North Carolina students for education purposes and is an 'eligible lender' under the insured student loan program administered by State Education Assistance Authority, and as such has made over ninety (90%) percent of the loans which have qualified for this program; and the members of the said corporation by its certificate of incorporation are: The Governor of the State of North Carolina; the Chairman of the North Carolina Board of Higher Education; the Treasurer of the State of North Carolina; the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chairman of the Board of Conservation and Development of the State of North Carolina; the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Business Development Corporation of North Carolina, and the governing trustees of the corporation by its certificate of incorporation are appointed by the Governor of North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their agreed statement, the parties listed eleven legal questions on which they sought a judicial declaration or adjudication.  Six relate to whether Chapter 1177 is violative of designated constitutional provisions.  Five relate to whether &quot;the operating procedures followed by the Authority&quot; are violative of &quot;the enabling legislation,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">i.e.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Chapter 1177.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court answered each of the legal questions in favor of plaintiff.  The judgment concludes as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;IT IS, THEREFORE, upon motion of attorneys for the plaintiff, State Education Assistance Authority, ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the three Series 'B' Student Loan Revenue Bonds, being Bonds Nos. B-476, B-477 and B-478, hereinbefore referred to, have been duly and legally authorized and duly and legally sold to the Bank of Statesville, and that the said revenue bonds, when delivered in accordance with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the agreement of the Authority and the Bank of Statesville, will be valid and binding obligations as revenue bonds of the Authority, in accordance with the tenor thereof, and that such bonds shall be exempt from all taxation within this State as provided by G.S. 116-209.13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that, upon delivery of the said bonds in accordance with the said agreement, the defendant, Bank of Statesville, shall accept and pay for the same in accordance with its agreement therefor which was made by said bank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant excepted and appealed.  On appeal, defendant assigns as error the &quot;signing and entering of the judgment.&quot; </SPAN></P>

The bank was ready, able, and willing to accept and pay for three $ 1,000 bonds if and when they were adjudged valid, but otherwise refused to do so. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment on appeal, holding that (1) Chapter 1177 did not unconstitutionally authorize use of public funds because the education of residents of the state was a recognized object of state government and the bond proceeds were used for a public purpose when used to make loan to meritorious North Carolinians of slender means; (2) because the tax-exempt feature made possible a more favorable sale of revenue bonds and thereby contributed substantially to the accomplishment of the public purpose for which they were issued, the General Assembly could exempt them from taxation by the state or any of its subdivisions; and (3) when the minimum standards prescribed by Chapter 1177 (N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 116-209.2) were supplemented by the standards prescribed by the federal legislation, the legislative standards for making such &quot;student loans&quot; were sufficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Fountain, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 17 November 1969 Criminal Session of Forsyth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant appeals from judgments sentencing him to death.  He was charged in two indictments with murder in the first degree and entered pleas of not guilty to each charge.  The two cases were consolidated for trial, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty as charged in each of the indictments, without recommendation that his punishment be imprisonment for life.  The indictments, verdicts, and judgments were all proper in form.  The crimes were alleged to have occurred in Surry County, but pursuant to an order changing venue, the trial was held in Forsyth County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence favorable to the State shows the following sequence of events: About 6 p.m. on 3 February 1969 defendant Perry Sanders, his brother Laxie Sanders, Charles Monroe, and James Monroe left Sanford, North Carolina in a 1967 red Dodge convertible belonging to Charles Monroe and headed in the direction of Winston-Salem, with the intention of robbing a service station to obtain money to pay their respective debts.  About 10 p.m. they came upon a service station near the airport in Winston-Salem.  Charles Monroe parked&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the car on a side street.  The other three men went into the station, and upon determining that the operator, Harvey King, was alone, Perry Sanders pulled his .22 caliber pistol and demanded money.  After King surrendered his money and his wallet, he was ordered into the stockroom and told to lie down on the floor.  Perry Sanders then struck King with a set of air horns and he appeared to be unconscious; however, he was conscious and as soon as the robbers left, King reported the robbery to the Forsyth County Sheriff's Department.  The defendant and his companions then drove north toward Rural Hall where they found Wesley Hunsucker's service station open around 10:25 p.m. Perry Sanders and James Monroe went inside, and after determining that Hunsucker was alone, the defendant pulled his pistol on the victim.  State's witness Hunsucker testified that Perry Sanders told him to &quot;stand up and take it easy or he would kill [him].&quot; After his wallet had been removed and the cash register emptied, Hunsucker was ordered to get down on the floor and was struck with a bottle by one of the robbers.  He was then ordered into the service area of the station and told to get down on his knees.  Monroe&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  struck Hunsucker on the head with his pistol, and Hunsucker, pretending to &quot;play dead,&quot; crumpled over some tires.  As Sanders and Monroe were leaving, Hunsucker heard one of them say, &quot;Shoot him, shoot him while he's down,&quot; and the other said, &quot;No, he's taken care of.&quot; On their way out, Sanders took a .32 gauge Ivey Johnson single-barrel shotgun from the office of the service station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to defendant's own testimony at trial, the following is an account of the incidents leading up to the arrest of defendant on the murder charges: After the robbery of the second service station, defendant and his companions drove north through Rural Hall toward Pilot Mountain.  On the Highway #52 Bypass around Pilot Mountain, a marked city police car began following the Monroe vehicle.  Monroe pulled his car over when the officers in the patrol car flashed the blue light.  Officers Ralph East and Glenn Branscome approached the Monroe car on the driver's side, and one of them asked Charles Monroe for his driver's license.  Then one of the officers said they had heard of an armed robbery and wanted to search the car; the four agreed to permit the search and got out of the car.  As Perry Sanders&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stepped out, he slid his .22 caliber pistol under the car.  Officer Branscome first searched James Monroe and found a pistol in his belt; he told Monroe that he was going to arrest him for carrying a pistol.  As Officer Branscome started to put the handcuffs on James Monroe, defendant picked up his pistol from underneath the car and fired at Branscome.  Defendant testified: &quot;I was thinking about what I would have to face, I guess. . . .  The first time I just threw my hands up.  I just threw the gun up and closed my eyes and fired.  I didn't aim, not really.  When I fired the shot he just started -- he just seemed to draw up and started screaming and I started firing again. . . .  I continued to fire the weapon until he stopped screaming.&quot; At this point Officer East, who was standing on the driver's side of the Monroe car, began running back to the patrol car.  Defendant testified as follows: &quot;[Officer East] started running and I caught him out of the corner of my eye and he was screaming and I ran up to him and I fired at him once or twice and he fell and he started screaming. . . .  I discovered that my own gun was empty.  I think I fired at him twice out of my gun and it kept&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  clicking and he was screaming and kicking and I just snatched his [pistol] up and started shooting.  I shot him with his weapon because he just kept up this scream. . . .  I quit firing after he stopped screaming.&quot; Defendant and Charles Monroe retrieved Monroe's driver's license from the shirt pocket of one of the officers, and the four men left, driving first toward Mount Airy on Highway #52 and then along Highway #601 toward Winston-Salem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 10:50 p.m. a motorist traveling toward Pilot Mountain on Highway #52 met a red car with one headlight burning.  A few minutes later the motorist came upon the officers' patrol car parked on the shoulder of the road with its headlights burning and the blue light flashing.  The bodies of Officers East and Branscome were lying within several feet of the patrol car; both had received multiple gunshot wounds in the head and body.  The bodies of the two officers were taken to the hospital where a later examination disclosed that Officer Branscome had seven gunshot wounds -- two in the head, one in the right shoulder, three in the chest area, and one in the right arm; and Officer East had five gunshot wounds -- one in the left shoulder, one in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the chest, and three through the head.  Death in each case resulted from these gunshot wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 12:15 and 12:30 a.m. on 4 February 1969, Winston-Salem Police Officer A. C. Brandon spotted a red convertible with one headlight burning, which matched the description of an automobile described earlier in a police broadcast alert.  The officer began following the convertible and radioed for assistance.  Police cars soon converged at an intersection, and the suspected car was stopped.  The four occupants, Perry Sanders, Laxie Sanders, Charles Monroe, and James Monroe, were ordered out of the car, and each was searched.  On a second search, a .22 caliber pistol was found concealed in Perry Sanders' undershorts.  A search of the car disclosed over $ 1,000 in various denominations of currency, a brown wallet containing the identification of Harvey Woodleaf King, a black wallet containing the identification of Wesley Ronald Hunsucker, and a 7.54 caliber automatic pistol.  All four men were taken into custody by the Winston-Salem police and arrived at the police station shortly after 12:30 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 1 a.m. Detective R. E. Linville, in the presence of S.B.I. Agent H. T. Hartley and Captain&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  H. C. Carter of the Detective Division of the Winston-Salem Police Department, after fully advising defendant of his constitutional rights, began questioning him.  With permission of defendant his statement was recorded on a tape recorder; it was transcribed and later signed by him in the Forsyth County jail about 3:30 p.m. on 4 February 1969 after he had read it and made a correction as to one of the names.  The confession, which was introduced in evidence by the State's witness R. E. Linville, was substantially similar to the testimony given by the defendant on the stand, the primary difference being the number of times that defendant shot the first officer.  In his confession defendant stated that he first shot Officer Branscome and then chased down Officer East, who was headed for the patrol car, and shot him from behind; he then took East's .38 caliber pistol and shot him several times in the head with it, and &quot;ran back and shot the other one [Branscome] four or five times until [he] finished emptying the gun.&quot; However, the defendant testified on the stand that he did not go back and shoot Branscome after he had shot East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's only evidence at trial was his own testimony, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in which he described the robberies of the two service stations and the shootings of the two police officers, and the testimony of three character witnesses, Sergeant Freeman Worthy of Fort Bragg; Jasper Sanders, the defendant's father; and Mrs. Harriet Johnson, an acquaintance.  Sergeant Worthy and Mrs. Johnson testified that defendant's general reputation was good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty as charged in each indictment of first degree murder, and the death sentence was imposed by the court.  From these judgments the defendant appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;No error.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a decision from the Superior Court of Forsyth County (North Carolina), which convicted him of two counts of first degree murder for killing two police officers who had stopped defendant and others to investigate robberies that had occurred in the vicinity. Defendant was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted that: (1) the single verdict procedure for a death sentence was improper; (2) the trial court improperly allowed exclusion of veniremen on the basis of race and opinion against the death penalty; (3) hearsay testimony was improperly admitted; and (4) his confession was coerced. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence to death because it determined that: (1) the single verdict system had repeatedly been upheld as an appropriate method, since two part jury trials had never been compelled; (2) defendant had failed to demonstrate that there had been intentional exclusions from the jury based on race or that he had been denied any right in sustaining challenges for cause because of prospective jurors' statements on capital punishment; (3) The statements made by defendant and another were not hearsay since they were made as part of the criminal act, and were therefore, attributable to defendant even if made by the other participant; and (4) his confession was not coerced because defendant had been fully advised of his rights and had freely, voluntarily, and understandingly waived his rights to counsel and made his statement voluntarily and with understanding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the conviction of defendant for two counts of first degree murder for the killing of two police officers and the sentence of defendant to death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeals, reported in 7 N.C. App. 289.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff operates a mobile home sales lot in the City of Raleigh.  It brought this action to enjoin the defendants from enforcing against the plaintiff and other mobile home dealers an ordinance of the City of Raleigh entitled &quot;An Ordinance to Provide for the Due Observance of Sunday.&quot; A temporary injunction was granted and the defendants were ordered to appear to show cause why it should not be continued to the final hearing and disposition of the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At such hearing before Hobgood, J., at the September 1968 Non-Jury Assigned Session of Wake, the defendants demurred ore tenus to the complaint.  The court concluded that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendants in that it appears from the face of the complaint that the ordinance does not violate the Constitution of North Carolina or the Constitution of the United States.  Consequently, the superior court entered judgment sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It continued the restraining order in effect pending the determination of the plaintiff's appeal to the Court of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeals.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the superior court.  The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court as a matter of right on the ground that a substantial constitutional question is involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The material portions of the ordinance provide:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, offer or expose for sale any goods, wares or merchandise in the city on Sunday (nor shall any store, shop, warehouse or any other place of business in which goods, wares or merchandise are kept for sale, be kept open between 12 midnight Saturday and 12 midnight Sunday,) unless such store, shop, warehouse or other place of business is expressly allowed to open and sell goods under the provisions of this chapter; * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">[Then follows a list of commodities which may not be sold on Sunday, irrespective of any other provision of the ordinance, and provisions that certain types of establishments may be kept open on Sunday, certain sports and amusement activities may be conducted on Sunday and certain commodities may be sold thereat.]</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In substance, the material allegations of the complaint (renumbered) are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) The foregoing ordinance was adopted 3 June 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The plaintiff operates a mobile home sales lot in the City of Raleigh and thereon &quot;sells, offers and exposes for sale only mobile homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) The plaintiff has for many years sold, offered or exposed for sale mobile homes seven days per week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) The said ordinance is being enforced against &quot;mobile home dealers and their agents and employees by preventing the selling, offering or exposing mobile homes for sale on Sunday,&quot; warrants having been issued against employees of such dealers charging them with violation of the ordinance, but the &quot;ordinance is not being enforced as to dealers in the sale, offering or exposing for sale of conventional homes on Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) Enforcement of the ordinance will result in a multiplicity of actions, fines and penalties against the plaintiff, will cause it to suffer substantial direct economic injury and will subject it to irreparable damage for which it has no adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) The plaintiff is in direct competition with persons selling, offering or exposing for sale conventional homes, the sale of which on Sunday is not prohibited by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(7) &quot;Conventional homes are sold, offered and exposed for sale in the City of Raleigh, North Carolina, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(8) Prospective purchasers of conventional homes are also prospective purchasers of mobile homes and the dealers and sellers of the two types of homes are similarly situated, are in the same class, and &quot;there is no reasonable or legal basis for distinguishing between the sellers of mobile homes and the sellers of conventional homes,&quot; and, therefore, the ordinance discriminates between those in the same class and similarly situated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(9) The ordinance permits certain sales and activities (i.e., the operation of grocery stores and curb markets) on Sunday, except between the hours of 10 a.m. and 12 noon, and &quot;the requirement for closing during these hours has no relationship to the setting aside of Sunday as a day of rest but was enacted to aid the observance of Sunday as a day of Christian worship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(10) The continued enforcement of the ordinance against the plaintiff, while sellers of conventional homes are permitted to sell such homes on Sunday, will constitute the enforcement of a discriminatory and unconstitutional ordinance, will deprive the plaintiff of its property without due process of law and deny to it the equal protection of the law in violation of Article I, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &sect; 17, of the Constitution of North Carolina and of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(11) The enforcement of the ordinance will violate the foregoing constitutional provisions because: (a) It does not affect all persons &quot;in the same class as plaintiff and engaged in similar operations to that of the plaintiff&quot;; (b) it is a &quot;use of the State's coercive power to aid * * * the Christian religion&quot;; (c) &quot;the classification of articles prohibited by the ordinance is arbitrary and discriminatory in that it excludes real property and includes personal property&quot;; (d) the classification has no reasonable relationship to the public peace, welfare, safety and morals; and (e) the ordinance is &quot;vague and indefinite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prayer of the complaint is for permanent injunction restraining the defendants from enforcing the ordinance or, alternatively, from enforcing it against the plaintiff and other mobile home dealers, their agents and employees.  The plaintiff further prays that the ordinance be declared null and void and that a temporary injunction issue.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff mobile home seller sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which held in favor of defendants, the mayor, the city council, and the chief of police, and affirmed the trial court's decision upholding an ordinance prohibiting mobile home sales on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The seller operated a mobile home sales lot in the city. It brought an action to enjoin city officials from enforcing an ordinance that prohibited Sunday hours and sales. The trial court ruled that the seller had not stated a claim of relief and sustained the demurrer of the city officials. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The seller then appealed to the court as a matter of right, on the ground that a substantial constitutional question was involved. The court affirmed and held that a law requiring the observance of Sunday as a day of rest and relaxation did not cease to be a reasonable exercise of the police power of the state, merely because it was in harmony with the religious beliefs of most Christian denominations. It was not arbitrary for the city to treat the sale of mobile homes and the sale of houses differently in its ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the court of appeals' affirmance of the trial court decision that the city could, by ordinance, prevent the mobile home seller from doing business on Sunday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant appeals from a judgment sentencing him to death, the jury having found him guilty of murder in the first degree and having made no recommendation that his punishment be imprisonment for life.  The indictment, verdict, and judgment were all in proper form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the trial, because of defendant's behavior, his privately employed counsel, Harold D. Downing, moved that the defendant be committed to State Hospital at Raleigh for observation and examination pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 122-91.  This was done, and on 12 March 1969 the hospital submitted its report and recommendations as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">Diagnosis:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> Without Psychosis (Not Insane).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">APA Code: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">91.10</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">Recommendations:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> Examination, observation and testing revealed no evidence of insanity or any other mental disturbance that might interfere with his ability to plead to the bill of indictment.  Mr. Williams can distinguish between right and wrong, he understands the nature and consequences of his criminal charges and he is able to assist in his own defense.  This patient should&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  return to court as being competent to stand trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the case was called for trial on the morning of 22 April 1969, the defendant at first refused to come into the courtroom but remained in his cell wrapped in a blanket, apparently nude.  The court then requested that Dr. O. A. Barnhill, a practicing physician in Elizabethtown, examine the defendant.  Dr. Barnhill did so and reported to the court that he had not elicited anything from the defendant that would lead him to believe that he was insane.  At the opening of court that afternoon, the defendant came into court fully and neatly clothed, apparently in possession of his faculties, and the scene was completely calm.  Counsel for the defendant participated in the selection of the jury.  However, after the jury was selected, the defendant announced that he did not want Downing or any other lawyer to represent him, that he understood the charges against him and understood his rights, but he did not want the court to appoint a lawyer for him and this decision was his own free choice.  Whereupon, the court announced:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Then, Mr. Williams, I would say to you and to Mr. Downing, since the law of North Carolina provides for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  a defendant charged with murder in the first degree to have counsel, I will require Mr. Downing to be available at court during the course of your trial; to be available for consultation with you if you want him; to be available where you can talk to him about any of the legal technicalities which may come up if you want to talk to him; to be available to answer questions to you if you want to ask him questions; and to be available to examine and cross-examine any witnesses if you should choose at any time that you want him to examine or cross-examine any witnesses.  He will not be required to directly participate in the trial unless you at some stage or at any stage of the trial shall change your mind, and decide you want him to help you.  If you at any time should decide you want him to help you, he will be immediately available and by your side to help you.  He will not be giving you advice during the course of the trial unless you shall ask him for it.  Do you have any questions you want to ask me concerning what I have just said to you and to him?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant answered that he had no questions and no objections to Mr. Downing being with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial then proceeded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the State offered evidence tending to show: The victim, Mary Diane Johnson Smith, a bride of nine days, lived with her husband in a house trailer on a rural road off Highway #210 in Bladen County.  She returned home from work about 4:45 p.m. on 7 October 1968.  When the deceased's husband returned from work about 6:30 p.m. his wife was not at home; his razor, a class ring, a pair of trousers, a pair of shoes, and a small train case containing $ 360 were missing from the trailer.  A sixteen-gauge shotgun was standing unloaded in the corner although it had been loaded when the husband left for work that morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 7:30 p.m. Deputy Sheriff King went to the Smith trailer and, with the aid of another deputy and other people, made an examination of the trailer and a search of the immediate surrounding area.  The body of the deceased, clad in underclothes and a shirt, was found in the bottom of a shallow drainage ditch in a field across the road from the trailer.  There was a hole in the back of her head approximately one inch in diameter and another hole in the left temple a little larger than the one in the back of her head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy King observed automobile tracks in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the vicinity leading to a spot of blood which covered an area of about two and one-half feet.  The tracks then led to a soybean field and circled back by the blood spot.  The deputy poured a cast of the tire prints for identification purposes.  A pair of safety boots was also found in the drainage ditch about thirty feet east of the body of the deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of 9 October 1968, in response to a call from authorities in Fayetteville, Sheriff Allen and Deputy King of Bladen County and two other officers went to Fayetteville and received custody of the defendant and a 1967 white Chevrolet automobile.  The automobile had four practically new tires bearing the marking &quot;Pure Pride&quot; on the sidewall.  This same marking was present in the tracks found by Deputy King in the soybean field.  The automobile was examined, and soybean plants and soil were removed from the chassis of the automobile.  The soil and soybeans taken from the car were compared with samples taken from the soybean field where the body was discovered, and the samples were found by a chemist with the State Bureau of Investigation to be of the same type.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 9 a.m. on 9 October 1968 Deputy King and Agent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bryan of the State Bureau of Investigation began interrogation of the defendant.  They advised him fully of his constitutional rights, and the defendant then made a statement to the officers in substance as follows: On the morning of 7 October 1968 he got a drink of liquor in Wilmington; he saw the keys in the 1967 Chevrolet automobile and took the automobile intending to go to Fayetteville; on the way he stopped at a house and took a camera, some jewelry, and a tape machine and then went to a second house where he got a shotgun, a rifle and some gun shells; he got lost, pulled off the highway and slept awhile.  When he awoke he drank some more liquor and continued on to Fayetteville.  He passed a trailer, saw the door open, and decided to go in and get some more clothes; he found Mrs. Smith in the trailer and held the gun on her while he was there, telling her she would not be harmed if she did as he said.  He ate some food, took several items from the trailer including a train case containing $ 360 and other articles, and then ordered Mrs. Smith to leave with him in the automobile.  He forced her to take off her trousers which he said was for the purpose of searching for money.  When&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  she refused to get into the car and began to run and holler, he shot her.  He put the body in a drainage ditch where he also disposed of his boots.  Then he got into the car and drove across the soybean field until he could go no farther; there he turned around and returned to the road.  Later, he stopped the car somewhere near Fayetteville and disposed of the clothes, guns, and other items he had taken and then drove on to Fayetteville where he spent the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day the defendant took the officers to the place in the woods where he had disposed of the articles taken from the houses and the trailer, and they recovered the train case belonging to the deceased with approximately $ 360 in it, a shotgun, a rifle, and several other items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the course of the trial defendant did not cross-examine the State's witnesses nor did he offer witnesses or testify in his own behalf, and at the close of the evidence he stated he did not want to make a speech to the jury and that he did not want Attorney Downing to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of all the testimony, the court called Dr. Andrew L. Laczko who testified in the absence of the jury that he examined the defendant at the State Hospital&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at Raleigh while the defendant was under his direction, care, and responsibility from 7 February 1969 until 13 March 1969; and as a result of a request from the court he had attended the trial and observed the defendant; he attempted to talk to the defendant but defendant refused to talk to him; he had not during his attendance at the trial, or in observing the defendant, seen or observed anything to cause him to form an opinion different from that previously expressed as to whether or not he now has a psychosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the jury returned its verdict and the court imposed the death sentence, the defendant stated he did not want to appeal.  However, his attorney moved for a new trial, which motion was overruled.  The attorney then gave notice of appeal and, on a finding by the court that the defendant was an indigent, he was permitted to appeal without giving security for costs.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for murder in the first degree. The court found no error in the conviction and affirmed it, finding that the trial court had no obligation to make an inquiry into the voluntariness of defendant's confession because defendant, who represented himself, did not object to its introduction. If defendant had objected to the confession then the trial court had a duty to conduct a hearing in the absence of the jury to determine its voluntariness, but absent such an objection that duty did not exist. The court concluded that there was nothing in the record to indicate that the confession was anything but voluntary after defendant had been fully apprised of his constitutional rights. The closing argument of the state solicitor that indicated the death sentence was appropriate for defendant was not so prejudicial as to constitute reversible error because the comments were in accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-176.1 that permitted the solicitor to urge the death sentence be imposed instead of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants under G.S. 7A-30(1) from decision of the Court of Appeals reported in 7 N.C. App. 107, 171 S.E. 2d 321.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 7 May 1969 Marvin Ray Sparrow (Marvin) was tried and convicted in Mecklenburg District Court upon two warrants charging him with the following offenses: (1) Contributing to the delinquency of Karen Torpey, a minor, in violation of G.S. 110-39 (now G.S. 14-316.1), and (2) resisting, delaying and obstructing a public officer in the discharge of his duties in violation of G.S. 14-223.  The cases were consolidated for judgment, and Marvin was sentenced to six months in jail, suspended for five years on condition he be of good behavior and pay a $ 50 fine and $ 15 costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 7 May 1969 Katherine Taft Sparrow (Katherine) was tried and convicted in Mecklenburg District Court upon three warrants charging her with the following offenses: (1) Contributing to the delinquency of Karen Torpey, a minor, in violation of G.S. 110-39, (2) resisting, delaying and obstructing a public officer in the discharge of his duties, and (3) assaulting an officer.  On the charges contained in (1) and (2), consolidated for judgment, she was sentenced to six months in jail, suspended&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for five years on condition she be of good behavior.  On the charge of assaulting an officer she was sentenced to thirty days in Mecklenburg County jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 7 May 1969 Britton Oxidine, Jr., was tried and convicted in Mecklenburg District Court upon a warrant charging him with contributing to the delinquency of Karen Torpey, a minor, in violation of G.S. 110-39.  He was sentenced to a term of six months in the Mecklenburg County jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants appealed to Mecklenburg Superior Court from the judgments pronounced.  There the cases were consolidated and tried </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before Mintz, J., and a jury, at the 12 May 1969 Schedule &quot;A&quot; Regular Session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that about five weeks prior to their arrest on 5 May 1969, Marvin (age 23) and his wife Katherine (age 21) rented a large two-story house in the city of Charlotte.  Twenty to twenty-five people of both sexes lived in the house with them, some on a permanent basis and others temporarily.  The rules of the house required permanent residents to contribute to the payment of rent, purchase of food, and to take part in housekeeping duties.  House furnishings included kitchen appliances and one table but consisted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  primarily of two beds and mattresses sufficient to provide pads for about twenty-five people.  It was necessary for a visitor to be at least sixteen years of age and have permission from at least five permanent residents in order to stay overnight.  Persons under sixteen years of age, however, had been allowed on occasions to spend the night there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence further shows that on Thursday morning, 1 May 1969, Karen Torpey, a fifteen-year-old girl, went to the Sparrow house without her mother's knowledge or permission.  She remained there throughout the day and slept that night in an upstairs room with other persons.  She spent Friday night of the same week in the social room of a dormitory in Chapel Hill with a group including Oxidine.  They returned to Charlotte Saturday morning, and that night Karen and Oxidine shared a bedroom at the home of one of his relatives.  They returned to the Sparrow house on Sunday but went back to his relative's home for several hours between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Karen failed to return from school at the regular time on Thursday afternoon, her mother began an unsuccessful search for her.  On the following day, which was Friday, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  May 2, the mother reported her daughter missing to the Charlotte police and visited the Sparrow house twice searching for her.  She talked with defendant Oxidine on both occasions and informed him her daughter was only fifteen years of age.  Oxidine told her Karen had been there but fled through the back door when she saw her mother approaching.  Karen later testified that she was hiding in an upstairs closet during one of her mother's visits to the Sparrow house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clyde White, a State's witness, testified that he saw Karen at the Sparrow house on a mattress with Oxidine in an upstairs room on Sunday evening at which time she offered him beer which she was drinking; that in the early hours of Monday morning while police officers were on the premises looking for Karen, she and Oxidine left the house and Oxidine asked him to let him know when the officers left; that Karen and Oxidine returned when the officers had gone, and shortly thereafter he, White, called the police and informed them Karen was in the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday morning, 5 May 1969, Karen's mother filed a petition in the district court in which she alleged that her daughter was uncontrollable, absent from home without permission, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and requested the court to assume custody.  District Judge Beacham signed a juvenile custody endorsement and, armed with this document, Officer Maness of the Charlotte Police Department went to the Sparrow house to serve the document on Karen and take her into custody.  He was unable to find her but later, as a result of a telephone call, returned to the Sparrow house accompanied by Lieutenant Hall, Sergeant Griffin, Officer Williams, two uniformed officers, and Clyde White.  Officers Hall, Griffin, and Maness went to the front door and the other officers went to the back door.  Officer Maness testified that as he knocked on the front door he could see the other officers, who had entered through the back door, already inside the house; however, Lieutenant Hall indicated that he did not see the other officers inside until after he had gained entrance.  In response to Officer Maness's knock on the front door, someone inside said &quot;come in.&quot; Officers Maness and Hall entered the front door, identified themselves to Marvin Sparrow, and advised him they had court orders to pick up Karen Torpey.  Maness began reading the court order aloud, but the entry of the officers created such upheaval&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  among the occupants of the house that he was unable to finish.  When Officer Maness asked Karen to come with him, she attempted to run out the front door.  Officer Maness caught her around the waist, whereupon Karen bit him on the hand and Marvin jumped on the officer's back.  When Lieutenant Hall took hold of Marvin and told him he was under arrest, Katherine attempted to free her husband and kicked Lieutenant Hall.  She was then arrested for obstructing and assaulting an officer.  Oxidine was also arrested at the scene and charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor.  Throughout this entire confrontation there was pushing and shoving by many, if not all, of the twenty-five people gathered in the &quot;living&quot; room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence for the defendants tends to show that Lieutenant Hall and Officer Maness entered the front door of the Sparrow house without knocking and without an invitation, and that the other officers entered through the back door before Hall and Maness had gained entrance at the front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of all the evidence Judge Mintz dismissed as of nonsuit the charge of assault on an officer against Katherine Sparrow.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty against&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  all defendants on the remaining charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marvin Ray Sparrow received concurrent sentences as follows: (1) Fifteen to eighteen months in prison for contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and (2) eight to twelve months for obstructing a public officer in the discharge of his duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Katherine Taft Sparrow received concurrent sentences as follows: (1) Nine months for contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and (2) six months for obstructing a public officer in the discharge of his duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britton Oxidine, Jr., was sentenced to prison for a term of eighteen to twenty-one months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals.  That court reversed the convictions of Marvin Ray Sparrow and Katherine Taft Sparrow on the charges of contributing to the delinquency of a minor but upheld the conviction and sentence of each of them on the charge of obstructing a public officer in the discharge of his duties.  The conviction and sentence of Britton Oxidine, Jr., on the charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor was also upheld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants appealed to this Court under the provisions of G.S. 7A-30(1) assigning numerous errors.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;As to Katherine Sparrow: Reversed.  As to Marvin&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sparrow: New trial.  As to Britton Oxidine: Affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which affirmed the superior court judgment convicting two defendants of obstructing a public officer in the discharge of his duties and one defendant of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and sentencing each defendant to a term greater than originally had been imposed in the district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants originally were convicted in the district court. They appealed as of right to the superior court, and were again convicted following a trial de novo. They received greater sentences than they had received in the district court. On appeal, the court held that the rule against vindictiveness in sentencing did not apply to bar the greater sentences, because the sentences were imposed after a de novo trial, and because defendants could appeal as of right, there was no fear that a heavier sentence would be imposed as punishment for appealing. The court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 110-39 was not unconstitutionally vague in its prohibition against contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and that the warrant charging one defendant with the crime was sufficient where it followed the wording of &sect; 110-39. Because the superior court failed to instruct the jury to determine whether the officers' entry into two defendants' home was legal, one defendant had to be retried on the obstruction charge. The other defendant's obstruction conviction was reversed due to a fatal variance between the warrant charging her and the proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the court of appeals' judgment that upheld one defendant's conviction for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The court reversed the court of appeals' judgment as to one defendant's conviction for obstructing a public officer in the discharge of his duties. The court found error as to the other defendant convicted of the same crime and remanded for his new trial on that charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants from decision of the Court of Appeals upholding judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Fountain, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, at the 23 May 1969 Session of Hyde Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each defendant was charged in a warrant with willfully standing upon the traveled portion of a state highway in such a manner as to impede the regular flow of traffic, a violation of G.S. 20-174.1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants were initially tried in the District Court of Hyde County and found guilty.  Henry Johnson, Jr., was sentenced to sixty days in jail, suspended, and said defendant placed on probation for eighteen months on condition that he pay a fine of $ 75.00 and the costs, be at his residence each evening by 11:30 p.m. unless otherwise permitted by his probation officer, and abide by the usual terms and conditions of probation.  The other five defendants were given sixty days in jail, suspended, and each defendant placed on probation for eighteen months on condition that each defendant pay a fine of $ 50.00 and the costs, be at his residence each evening by 11:30 p.m. unless otherwise permitted by his probation officer, and abide by the usual terms and conditions of probation.  From these judgments defendants appealed to the Superior Court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Hyde County where they were brought to trial at the 19 May 1969 Criminal Session.  The cases were consolidated by consent for purpose of trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the call of the cases, defense counsel moved to quash the jury venire and indicated a desire &quot;to make a showing on it.&quot; The court expressed its willingness to hear any evidence defendants wished to offer on the motion but refused to delay the trial.  The only evidence offered in that respect was a showing that of the total jurors present on the regular jury panel and as supplemental jurors, fifty-four were white and twenty were Negro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence tends to show that on 11 November 1968 the defendants, with a crowd of approximately one hundred people, were walking in a westerly direction on U. S. Highway 264 approaching the courthouse in Swan Quarter, North Carolina.  The crowd proceeded to the courthouse where it remained for more than an hour demonstrating, singing, chanting and shouting.  The group then started back on U. S. 264.  For the first few hundred yards the crowd was orderly.  Then the defendants, with a few others, began marching back and forth across the highway chanting and hollering.  &quot;It was a continual thing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  after they started,&quot; and continued for over ten minutes before the arrests were made.  Traffic was blocked from both directions because defendants were in the roadway marching back and forth from side to side, &quot;raising their knees up high and rearing back as they walked and they were singing, clapping and screaming.&quot; In this fashion these defendants, and about a dozen others not involved in this case, occupied the highway for about five minutes thus forcing vehicular traffic to stop.  Defendants were admonished by highway patrolmen to clear the highway and permit traffic to resume its normal flow.  They ignored the admonition and continued to chant and sing while the vehicles were stopped.  Defendants were thereupon placed under arrest and brought to trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants offered no evidence but moved for judgment of nonsuit at the close of the evidence for the State.  This motion was denied and, after arguments of counsel and charge of the court, the case was submitted to the jury.  Defendants were found guilty as charged and the presiding judge pronounced judgment as follows: Henry Johnson, Jr., was given an active sentence of nine months in the common jail of Hyde County.  The other&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  five defendants were each given an active sentence of six months in the common jail of Hyde County.  All defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals where the sentences were upheld, 7 N.C. App. 282, 172 S.E. 2d 280. Defendants thereupon appealed to the SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA assigning errors as noted in the opinion.  </SPAN></P>

Defendants were originally tried in a district court, which convicted them. Defendants appealed to the superior court, which conducted a trial de novo and convicted defendants. The intermediate appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions. On appeal, the court affirmed defendants' convictions. The court held that: (1) defendants' Due Process and Equal Protection rights were not violated because they had ample time to present evidence showing that the jury venire was improper; (2) the superior court, upon a trial de novo, had the authority to sentence defendants to greater sentences than the district court imposed; and (3) N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-174.1 made it unlawful to stand, walk, and the like if done willfully to impede traffic.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant under G.S. 7A-30(1) to review the decision of the Court of Appeals (5 N.C. App. 684, 169 S.E. 2d 193) reversing judgment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McLean, J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 14 October 1968 Civil Session of Buncombe, docketed and argued in the Supreme Court as Case No. 42 at the Fall Term 1969.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, North Carolina State Highway Commission, instituted this action on 11 May 1964 to condemn seven separate areas, totaling approximately 5.6 acres and contained within a 277-acre tract belonging to defendant.  In its complaint and declaration of taking plaintiff asserted: (1) Those portions of defendant's property, shown on plan sheets 12, 13, 14, and 15-A attached to the complaint, are required for the construction of State Highway Project 8.19095.  (This project involved the construction of a section of Interstate Highway No. 40 and the relocation of the Sand Hill Road to overpass it.) (2) Plaintiff condemns the described lands under the authority of G.S. 136-19 and G.S. 136-103&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and takes a &quot;fee simple title to right of way and additional easement, in perpetuity, for construction for all purposes for which the plaintiff is authorized by law to subject the same.&quot; Access is controlled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and limited solely to the points designated on the plan sheets.  (3) Plaintiff's estimate of just compensation for the land taken is $ 4,300.00 which has been deposited to defendant's credit with the Clerk of the Superior Court of Buncombe County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter defendant withdrew the deposit and filed answer admitting all material allegations of the complaint but alleging its damage to be $ 30,000.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A consent order was entered by Anglin, J., on 20 October 1966 adjudging (1) that all issues other than the issue of damages had been resolved by consent of the parties; (2) that the State Highway Commission acquired a fee simple title to tracts 1-6 and a drainage easement in the seventh tract; and (3) that access was fully controlled on new right-of-way tracts 3, 4, and 6 and on that portion of new right-of-way tract 5 lying south of a line marked &quot;C/A&quot; (controlled access) as shown on the official map of the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tract No. 5 is the southeastern corner of defendant's property and contains .335 acres.  This appeal, however, involves only that portion of tract 5 (containing .074 acres) which lies north of the line C/A, the shaded area on the illustrative map inserted in this opinion. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The approximate dimensions of the area are 40 X 90 X 50 X 100 feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is established by stipulation that C. A. Mashburn owned 1.5 acres adjoining the southeast corner of defendant's lands.  On this tract is located the Mashburn one-family residence.  Plaintiff required that portion of the Mashburn property lying south of the line C/A for Project 8.19095, the area within the heavy black lines on the illustrative map.  The only access to the Mashburn property was a driveway through this area to the Sand Hill Road.  The condemnation of the area within the heavy black lines would leave the remaining Mashburn tract landlocked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 3 June 1964, in consideration of $ 8,300.00 and plaintiff's agreement to relocate their driveway and a waterline, Mr. and Mrs. Mashburn conveyed to plaintiff the property within the heavy black lines.  The conveyance specified that the relocated driveway would be 12 feet in width, approximately 105 feet long, surfaced with crushed stone and connected with Sand Hill Road.  There was no other written agreement between plaintiff and the Mashburns, and there has been no conveyance of any lands or easement from plaintiff to the Mashburns.  Plaintiff constructed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the driveway over the hatched portion of tract 5 as shown on the illustrative map.  Had not plaintiff utilized that part of tract 5 as an access road the Mashburn property would have been completely landlocked, and plaintiff's evidence tended to show it would have had to pay the Mashburns about $ 40,000.00 for their property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 10 May 1968 defendant moved for permission to amend its answer in order to allege: That part of tract 5 lying north of line C/A and east of the Mashburn property line was not required for a public purpose; it was taken for a private purpose &quot;in that the same was appropriated to provide the said C. A. Mashburn with a private driveway leading across the property of this defendant . . . .&quot; Judge McLean allowed the amendment on 11 June 1968.  By this amendment defendant attempted, for the first time, to challenge plaintiff's power to condemn a portion of its property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter plaintiff amended its complaint and declaration of [SEE ILLUSTRATIVE IN ORIGINAL] taking to allege that it proceeded in this action under the authority of G.S. 136-19&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, G.S. 136-18, G.S. 136-54, and G.S. 136-89.48 through G.S. 136-89.58.  In a reply to the amended answer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it alleged, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1) When defendant withdrew the deposit on 21 May 1964 it had knowledge that plaintiff was taking the land for the purpose of providing access to the Mashburn lands, and by the withdrawal it waived any right to contest the propriety of the taking; and (2), having waited three and a half years after the completion of the driveway before amending its answer, defendant is barred by its laches from contesting plaintiff's right to take the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, defendant amended its answer to allege that if G.S. 136-18(6) &quot;purports to give plaintiff the power to condemn excess lands beyond those necessary for use in the road right of way or for maintenance.  . . .&quot; the same is unconstitutional and a violation of &sect; 17, Article I of the Constitution of North Carolina and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 14 October 1968 Judge McLean heard this matter upon stipulations and evidence offered by both parties.  In addition to facts substantially as detailed above, he found the following: (1) That portion of tract No. 5 north of the line C/A is not necessary for the maintenance or lateral support of the relocated Sand Hill Road.  (2) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The only reason plaintiff attempted to condemn that area was to provide access to the Mashburn property from relocated Sand Hill Road.  (3) Defendant had no knowledge of the use to which plaintiff intended to put the area in dispute at the time it filed answer or on 20 October 1966, the date of the consent order settling the issues.  Judge McLean concluded as a matter of law that the disputed area was not needed for a public purpose, and the taking was therefore unconstitutional.  He also adjudged (1) that defendant was not bound by the consent order of 20 October 1966 and that it had not waived its &quot;right to oppose the taking of its property for private purposes&quot;; and (2) that plaintiff had not acquired title to the disputed area.  Whereupon, he ordered plaintiff &quot;to return dominion and control of said lands&quot; to defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff excepted to the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law and appealed.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  It held: (1) In providing the landlocked Mashburn property access to Sand Hill Road over the disputed area, plaintiff was acting within its statutory and constitutional authority for a public purpose.  (2) The consent order of 20 October 1966&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (which defendant did not move to vacate or modify), was res judicata of plaintiff's right to condemn all of tract No. 5.  (3) Defendant's withdrawal and retention of the deposit which plaintiff had made on 11 May 1964 precluded defendant from questioning plaintiff's right to condemn all the lands described on the plan sheets attached to the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relying upon G.S. 7A-30(1), defendant appealed to the Supreme Court alleging the violation of rights guaranteed to it by Article I &sect; 17 of the Constitution of North Carolina and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  </SPAN></P>

The landowner only contested the amount of damages, not the actual taking. After the landowner learned that a portion of his property was being used to provide a new driveway to another landowner, who would otherwise have been landlocked, he amended his answer. The trial court held that the Commission was not entitled to condemn the portion of the land for a private use, and the appellate court reversed. The court affirmed the appellate court's decision because the taking was for a public purpose and the condemnation was authorized. The court determined that the driveway came within the definition of a frontage road and would also be available to provide access to the landowner's abutting property. The court concluded that the driveway was auxiliary to, and necessitated by the construction of, the highway. Even though the principal use of the driveway was to provide access to private property, the public interest required its establishment, and the public purpose for which the land was taken continued to be accomplished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Thornburg, S.J.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, April 28, 1969 Session, Cleveland Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this criminal prosecution the defendant, Robert Louis Roseboro, was indicted for the first degree murder of Mary Helen Kendrick Williams.  The bill of indictment, proper in form, charged the killing occurred in Cleveland County on June 22, 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately after the indictment was returned, the court, upon inquiry, found the defendant to be indigent, and appointed attorney Horace Kennedy to represent him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the October Session of the court, the defendant, by petition, requested that attorney Kennedy be released as defense counsel and that Julius Chambers of Charlotte be appointed in his stead.  The court granted the motion to relieve attorney Kennedy and to substitute attorney Chambers.  Mr. Chambers filed a motion for continuance and for an order that the prosecution be required to disclose and make available to the defendant evidence in the possession and control of the State, including a list of all prospective State's witnesses.  In response to the motion, the court entered this order:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;. . . (T)hat the State shall make available to the defendant for inspection and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  copying the evidence now in the possession of the State; that the State shall further make available to the defendant prospective State's witnesses for the purpose of interview, and the State shall advise said witnesses that defense counsel has the right to interview them and that the State shall further make available police reports and statements of witnesses pertaining to defendant's case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By consent, the case was continued a number of times.  However, at the March, 1969 Session, the defendant filed a written motion to quash the indictment.  In summary, these are the grounds for the motion: (1) That persons of the defendant's economic class and race were systematically excluded from the grand jury which returned the indictment; (2) That G.S. 14-17 under which the defendant was indicted is unconstitutional in that it provides the death penalty upon conviction, but gives the jury the right to recommend life imprisonment without fixing any standards or rules to govern the exercise of the right; (3) That G.S. 15-162.1, in effect at the time of the offense (but repealed before trial), placed an unconstitutional burden on the defendant and chilled his right to plead not guilty and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to have a jury trial as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States; (4) That the capital charge provided by G.S. 14-17, absent a jury recommendation of life imprisonment, requires a death sentence which is cruel and unusual punishment, forbidden by the Constitution of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court conducted a full inquiry into the manner of selecting the Cleveland County grand jury which returned the indictment.  The court found, upon competent evidence:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;12. That at no time in making up the list of prospective jurors was any consideration given to the race, creed, color, or economic status of any person whose name appeared on said list; that no discrimination on any basis appeared to exist in obtaining names for the jury list; that no discrimination of any kind was practiced in obtaining said list;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">13. That the jury commission in preparing the list used the tax list of the county and the voter registration records as required by law but did not deem it necessary or desirable to seek any other sources of names;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">14. That Grady McArter, Chairman of the Grand Jury that issued the indictment against the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">  remembered the makeup of the Grand Jury to be approximately half black and half white, but recalled only one member of the Grand Jury to be unemployed, he being retired and previously employed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court concluded:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;2. That the grand jury which indicted the defendant, Robert Louis Roseboro, was properly constituted;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3. That the bill of indictment returned by the grand jury against the defendant, Robert Louis Roseboro, is valid and proper in all respects. . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the March 6, 1969 Session, the defendant filed a motion to remove the cause from Cleveland County upon the alleged ground the defendant could not obtain a fair trial either in Cleveland, where the bill was returned, or in the adjoining county of Gaston or Rutherford because of the unfavorable and wide-spread publicity.  In lieu of the request to remove the cause to a county other than Gaston or Rutherford, the court, as provided in G.S. 9-12, ordered that a trial jury be summoned from the adjoining county of Burke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One original and two additional writs of venire facias were required before the trial jury, consisting of twelve regular jurors and one alternate, was empaneled.  The defendant filed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a challenge to the return of each writ upon the ground that members of his economic class and race were arbitrarily and systematically excluded.  Judge Thornburg conducted another hearing and at its conclusion found the challenges were not sustained and that the method of preparing the jury list and drawing the names was not in violation of the defendant's rights.  Evidence supported the findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actual selection of the trial jury proceeded according to the North Carolina custom and practice.  Each venireman was called and sworn to make true answers to the questions asked by the court or by anyone under its direction touching his fitness to serve as a juror.  First the State, then the defendant, and finally the court, proceeded with the interrogation of each venireman as his name was drawn from the hat.  After the examination of each venireman was completed, the court heard and passed on challenges for cause.  The State attempted to challenge for cause those who opposed capital punishment.  The defendant attempted to challenge for cause those who favored capital punishment.  The court made individual findings in each case.  Challenges for cause were overruled if a venireman stated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he could hear the evidence, the arguments of counsel, the charge of the court, consider all permissible verdicts, and could return a verdict based on the evidence and the law as defined by the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record discloses that both the State and the defendant used all peremptory challenges allowed by law.  The defendant sought to exercise a fifteenth peremptory challenge, and excepted when the court refused to allow it.  The procedure employed in selecting the jury is set out in 416 pages of the record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sufficiency of the State's evidence to make out a case of murder in the first degree does not seem to be seriously challenged.  Consequently, the evidence, only in short summary, is reported here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In substance, the evidence disclosed that on June 22, 1968, the deceased, Mary Helen Kendrick Williams, a white woman, operated &quot;Mary's Custom Towel Outlet&quot; in Shelby, Cleveland County.  The one story shop had three doors, one on the north and one on the south of the building, and a double door for loading on the east.  The north and south doors apparently had glass panels.  The double door on the east was secured from the inside by a 2 X 4 resting in hooks attached to the door facings. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The main room of the shop contained display tables.  There was a bathroom located off the display room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Lola Williams, mother-in-law of Mary Helen Kendrick Williams, called the towel shop over the telephone at 10:45 on the morning of June 22, 1968.  Mary Helen answered.  She seemed busy and the mother-in-law did not engage her in any further conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 11:15 a.m., Mrs. Alberghini, a prospective customer, found the entrance door locked.  Through the glass she saw a person, whom she identified as the defendant, inside the display room.  She banged on the door in order to ascertain whether the shop would be opened.  She turned away for a moment to speak to her daughter who was in an automobile parked near the door.  When she looked again, the person inside had disappeared.  &quot;. . . I saw him . . . on the floor, looking around a table. . . .  His face was right on the floor. . . .&quot; The witness went to a place of business next door and had the police notified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers Blankenship and Lowery arrived at about 11:30.  They found all doors locked or barred.  They saw the defendant inside the shop with a pistol in his hand.  They also saw a human body and blood on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the floor.  They commanded the defendant to come out with his hands up.  Instead, he concealed himself in the building.  The officers then broke open a window and threw in a tear gas bomb.  After a short interval, the defendant, forced out by the fumes, surrendered.  He was unarmed.  He had a bunch of keys in his pocket and a cigarette lighter with the letters &quot;Bob&quot; engraved thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As soon as the fumes permitted, the officers entered the building.  They found the nude body of Mrs. Williams behind one of the display tables.  The body was warm and covered with blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The autopsy conducted by Dr. Gentry, a Pathologist, disclosed &quot;gaping&quot; head wounds and four penetrating stab wounds in the chest, and one in the abdomen.  The chest wounds were five or more inches deep, two had penetrated the heart.  In the opinion of Dr. Gentry, the stab wounds in the chest caused death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A search of the room disclosed a part of a broken pistol grip near the body.  The articles of clothing which the victim wore to work that morning were found on the floor of the bathroom.  The undergarments were in disarray.  Some were turned wrongside out.  Near the clothing, the officers found a pair of sun glasses, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a pocket knife and a pistol with the grip broken.  The broken part found near the body fitted the broken grip of the pistol found in the bathroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A State's witness testified that three days before the killing, he saw in the defendant's possession a knife similar to the one discovered in the bathroom and introduced in evidence.  A clerk, who worked in Blanton's Variety Store near the shop, testified that about 9:30 or 10:00 on the morning of the homicide, she sold the defendant a pair of sun glasses.  She exhibited to the jury a card which held eleven pairs of sun glasses -- one space was empty.  The witness stated the only sale from the card was made to the defendant.  When asked whether the glasses found in the shop and introduced in evidence were the glasses she sold the defendant, she replied, &quot;Yes, sir, I think they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim's daughter identified the cigarette lighter with the engraving &quot;Bob&quot; as belonging to her mother.  This lighter was taken from the defendant's pocket after his surrender.  The three keys also taken from the defendant's pocket were held together by two rings.  One of the keys unlocked the south door, a second unlocked the north door, and the third&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unlocked the shop's cash register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An expert in blood analysis testified that the blood splotches found on the defendant's clothing were of group A, the same type as the victim's blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of the State's evidence, counsel for defendant moved for a directed verdict of not guilty.  The court denied the motion.  The defendant did not offer evidence.  The court ruled that defense counsel had the right to open and conclude the argument.  The defendant waived his right to open the argument, but did conclude.  The ruling followed North Carolina practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After argument and the court's charge, the jury returned a verdict &quot;guilty of murder in the first degree&quot;.  The court denied defense motion to set aside the verdict.  From the sentence of death in the manner provided by law, the defendant appealed.  </SPAN></P>
