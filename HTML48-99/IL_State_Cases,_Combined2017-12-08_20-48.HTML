</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant township challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which ruled that the township expansions under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 139, paras. 127-133a (1973), originally enacted as 1877 Ill. Laws 212, occurring since the effective date of Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 5 were invalid. The trial court also held that municipal annexations were unaffected by Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff land owners cross-appealed from that portion of the decision that held valid the annexations by defendant city under &sect; 7-1-13 of the Municipal Code without holding public referenda. The trial court rolled back the boundaries of the township to those existing on July 1, 1971, the effective date of the 1970 Illinois Constitution and Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 5. Only the township appealed from the decision regarding township boundaries. The issue for the court's consideration was whether the annexation of territory by the township resulted in one or more townships being &quot;divided&quot; within the meaning of Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 5. On appeal, the court held that: (1) &quot;divided' logically referred only to those situations in which one or more townships were separated in such a fashion as to create additional townships that did not previously exist; (2) simply boundary changes between townships did not need to be preceded by public referenda in the affected townships; (3) the annexation of territory by the city and the township involved nothing more than boundary changes; and (4) the township and its surrounding townships all continued in existence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed that portion of the trial court's judgment ruling that the township expansions were invalid and rolling back the boundaries of the township to those existing on July 1, 1971. The court affirmed that portion of the trial court's judgment approving annexation by the city without a public referendum.</SPAN></P>

The judges had refused to convene, finding the death penalty statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-1A (1973), unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecution in two murder cases sought to have the death penalty considered but the three-judge panel convened under the death penalty statute found the statute invalid. The court denied the requested writ to force the judges to act, agreeing that the death penalty statute was unconstitutional. The court held that (1) the impaneling of a three-judge court was a usurpation of the judiciary's right to create courts because the legislature had no constitutional authority to create a new court under Ill. Const. art. VI (1970); (2) the provision relating to the exercise of &quot;compelling reasons for mercy&quot; contained no standards for its implementation; and (3) the provision establishing the appellate review procedure implied that appellate courts, rather than the Supreme Court of Illinois pursuant to Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 4(b), would hear death penalty appeals. The court found that the provisions were not severable and that the entire death penalty statute was unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Director of Labor sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court of Adams County (Illinois) dismissing appellant's action seeking to permanently enjoin appellant non-resident corporation from continuing to carry on public works projects construction in the county for the reason that appellee failed to employ Illinois laborers as required by the Preference to Citizens on Public Works Projects Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Director of Labor filed an action seeking to permanently enjoin appellee non-resident corporation from continuing to carry on public works projects in the county for the reason that appellee failed to employ Illinois laborers as required by the Preference to Citizens on Public Works Projects Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 269 through 275 (1973). The court reversed the trial court's judgment dismissing appellant's action on grounds the statute was unconstitutional and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that the preference against employment of resident aliens on public works projects was violative of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and ruled that a one-year residency requirement for eligibility as an Illinois laborer created an invidious classification that penalized the right of interstate travel by denying new residents a vital government benefit. But the court held that Illinois could give preference to its residents for employment in public works projects without violating the equal protection clause, as such the court could not state whether the statute would have been enacted without the invalid portions eliminated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings. The court eliminated certain portions of a statute favoring Illinois laborers which were deemed unconstitutional but the court found that the General Assembly intended to favor residents of Illinois for employment on public works projects and the court was unable to say that the statute would not have been enacted with the invalid portions eliminated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquors under &sect; 11-501(a) of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501(a) (1973). The circuit court held that &sect; 11-501.1 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501.1 (1973) as amended by &sect; 27 of Public Act No. 78-255, 1973 Ill. Laws 845 was unconstitutional and granted defendant's motion to suppress the results of a breath analysis test. On appeal, the People contended that the circuit court erred in determining that the test results were inadmissible. The court reversed the order granting defendant's motion to suppress and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that Public Act No. 78-255 was plainly a revisory act and did not make a substantive change in &sect; 11-501.1 of the Code, and therefore, did not violate the prohibitions of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d) (1970), which required that bills be confined to one subject. The public act was not a reenactment but simply corrected inconsistencies in the original act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 20 of &quot;an Act in relation to fire protection districts,&quot; Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127 1/2, para. 38.3 (1965), provided that any territory within a fire district which had been annexed to a city, village, or town that provided fire property for property within its area was to be disconnected from the fire district by a certain date if not challenged by the fire district. As disconnection approached, the fire district filed a petition alleging that part of its territory had been annexed to the village prior to the effective date of the Act and that the loss of assessed valuation by reason of the disconnection would impair its ability to render fully adequate fire protection service to the remaining territory in the district. The court held that the district had failed to meet its burden of proving the disconnection would impair its ability to render fully adequate fire protection to the territory remaining after disconnection. The court found that the district's witnesses failed to take into account the reduction in costs of operations that would occur when the territory was disconnected.</SPAN></P>

The builders filed a motion dismiss the complaint on the ground that the city had no authority to enforce setback lines outside its corporate limits.

Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-13-1 (1973), to prescribe setback lines in areas beyond its own boundaries. The court reversed the judgments against the city and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. The court determined that &sect; 11-13-1 did not limit the city's power to establish setback lines to its boundaries. The court found that the city might be frustrated in attempting to enforce other provisions of its zoning regulations if it was not allowed to establish setback lines. The court held that a provision in an amendment to &sect; 11-13-1 that differentiated between home rule units and non-home rule units concerning the power to zone extraterritorially was void because it established an unconstitutional classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation filed suit individually and on behalf of all who have been required or would be required by the Cook County ordinance to pay a library fee at the time of the filing of the first pleading or other appearance by each party in all civil cases. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. The trial court denied the motion and upon a representation by defendants that they would stand on their motion, entered a final judgment declaring the county ordinance void. Defendants appealed, arguing that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the county's home rule authority under Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(a) (1970). In affirming, the court held that the administration of justice under the state constitution was a matter of statewide concern and did not pertain to local government or affairs. Since the powers of the county as a home rule unit related only to its own affairs and not to those of the state, the ordinance imposing the filing fee was invalid. The payment of the fee as a condition to the right to litigate in the courts was a burden that could not be imposed by the county.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) held that the ordinance was constitutional, and plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs claimed that the liquor tax ordinance on the retail sale of alcoholic beverages violated &sect; 6 of the Ill.

Specifically, plaintiffs contended that the passage of the ordinance exceeded the scope of the county's home-rule power. Plaintiffs further alleged a denial of due process based on the method of tax collection, which occurred prior to the actual retail sale of the alcoholic beverages. The trial court upheld the county ordinance as constitutional, and plaintiffs appealed. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that: (1) the county did not exceed its home-rule authority by enacting the liquor tax ordinance where there was no specific restriction on the county's home-rule powers; (2) the ordinance did not violate equal protection and due process because there was no unlawful delegation of legislative authority and the ordinance contained sufficient controls and standards; (3) the system used to collect the liquor tax was reasonable and was not unconstitutional; and (4) plaintiffs failed to establish the invalidity of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff State of Illinois (state) appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that granted defendant employer's motion to dismiss the complaint in which the State charged the employer with violating Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 2c (1973) by advertising for new employees during a strike but not including within such advertisement the fact that a strike was in progress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court concluded that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 2c (1973), which made it a petty misdemeanor to advertise for new employees without also stating in the advertisement that a strike was in progress, was preempted by federal labor law. The court agreed and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The starting point for the court's analysis was the rule that whether an activity was protected by either &sect; 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;157, or &sect; 8 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 158, the state's law must yield. From there the court reasoned that even if the activity described in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 2c (1973) was neither protected nor prohibited by the NLRA, the state's statute was preempted. That conclusion was premised upon the United State Supreme Court's observation that the touchstone for preemption ultimately depended upon whether a state law operated to frustrate the purposes of the NLRA. The state's statute clearly frustrated Congress' intent by impinging upon an area of labor, an employer's right to hire new employees to replace strikers, that Congress had already decided in favor of an employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment that held that a state law that made it a petty misdemeanor for the employer to advertise for new employees during a strike without also stating in the advertisement that a strike was in progress was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff's action named 17 defendants, including the architect and defendant general contractor, alleging that they violated Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 60 - 69 (1971) through their faulty erection, operation and placement of the crane that injured him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff was injured while working at a construction site when a crane came into contact with electrical transmission wires and caused him severe burns. The court held that the architect's claim for indemnity against the general contractor was properly struck under the indemnity statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1971, ch. 29, par. 61, which made void any agreement indemnifying one against his own negligence in construction contracts. The court determined that there were sufficient differences between the construction industry and others to form a reasonable basis for the classification difference in the legislation. The statute would thwart attempts to avoid the consequences of liability and thereby insured a continuing motivation for persons responsible for construction activities to take accident prevention measures and provide safe working conditions. The court rejected the architect's arguments because an agreement to indemnify against wilful misconduct would, as a general rule, be contrary to public policy and unenforceable though there was no statute to that effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court striking the architect's cross complaint for indemnity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated appeal, the illegitimate children sought review of decision denying them inheritance from their biological fathers through intestate succession under &sect; 12 of the Probate Act. The court affirmed. The court held that the illegitimate children had not been legitimatized in accord with &sect; 12 of the Probate Act and were not considered heirs in intestate succession. The fathers had acknowledged the illegitimate children but had never married the natural mothers. The court found that expansion of the inheritance rights of the illegitimate children had to be left to legislative modification. Also, the statutory scheme did not violate the federal and state constitutional provisions guaranteeing equal protection of law because it was not racially or sexually discriminatory. Section 12 of the Probate Act did not contain any racial or sexual classification, and it affected all members of the class of illegitimate children without regard to racial heritage or gender.

The wholesalers also contended that the legislature intended to reimburse the wholesalers for all costs of tax collection. The trial court ruled that &sect; 2(b) was constitutional and ordered the dismissal of the wholesalers' suit.

The state's attorney thereafter filed an action for issuance of a writ of mandamus or supervisory order to compel the trial judge to grant the motion as to the alibi defense. The court ruled that the case presented an issue appropriately considered in an original action in mandamus, that the Illinois Supreme Court rules of discovery in criminal cases applied to the defense of alibi, and that Ill.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and two accomplices were indicted by the State for burglarizing a road equipment company. The accomplices testified that defendant was involved. He testified, however, that he had met a woman at a bar earlier that evening, and they had agreed to meet at a truck stop that night. Defendant asserted he was with the woman while the burglary was taking place. The trial court sustained the State's objection to the woman's testimony based on defendant's failure to comply with the alibi statute, which required a defendant to inform the prosecuting attorney, no less than five days before trial, of his intent to call such a witness. The court found the exclusion of her testimony was error of a constitutional magnitude. The State argued that the improper exclusion of the alibi witness did not require reversal of the conviction because it was, at most, harmless error. The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment because the exclusion was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Had the woman testified, the jury might have considered not only her testimony in weighing her credibility, but also the fact of a married woman admitting that she was with a man other than her husband.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After he pleaded guilty to burglary, escape, and armed robbery, defendant appealed arguing that his pleas of guilty to escape and armed robbery were invalid because he was confused about the possibility of receiving an enhanced sentence for burglary and that his convictions for burglary and escape required reversal because he was not admonished that the sentences imposed included the mandatory period of parole. The appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences but found that &sect; 1005-8-1(e) and &sect; 1003-3-9(a)(3)(i) were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court agreed with the appellate court that the trial court clearly explained to defendant that if he pleaded guilty to the escape and armed-robbery charges, it would consider those pleas in sentencing on the burglary charge and that defendant understood that when he entered his guilty pleas. The court found, however, that the issue of the constitutionality of the Code provisions was premature because defendant was not eligible for parole and that he was properly admonished that his sentences included the parole period as required by Ill.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue on appeal was the constitutionality of &sect; 14 - 2 of the Criminal Code of 1961, Ill. Rev.

Defendant's conversations with a person in which he solicited the other person to kill his wife were taped at the request of the State's attorney's office. The person whom was solicited gave his consent to have the conversations taped. The court reversed the trial court's decision, holding that warrantless one party consent eavesdropping was not a violation of the fourth amendment. The court held that it was not defendant's expectation of privacy that was at issue, but rather the reasonableness of the conduct of the police with which the fourth amendment was concerned. The court also held that the fourteenth amendment was not violated because it did not violate due process to leave with the state's attorney the decision whether or not to record conversations with the consent of one of the parties to them. The court held that Ill. Const. of 1970 art. I, &sect; 6 was not intended to render such eavesdropping unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were convicted of supplying liquor to minors, possession of a substance that contained cannabis, and deceptive practices.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed because the State was not constitutionally required to furnish defendants with verbatim transcripts of the proceedings at which they acknowledged their guilt. What was constitutionally required was a record of sufficient completeness that permitted proper consideration of the specific claims made by defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court declared the ordinance unconstitutional. Intervenor villages opposed the awarding of attorneys' fees. The ordinance had imposed a service charge for the county's actual cost of assessing, billing, collecting, and distributing property taxes levied by the municipalities and taxing districts. Plaintiffs' attorneys argued that by reason of their successful attack they recovered monies from the county for the municipalities and taxing districts and that each of the municipalities and taxing districts benefited by the recovery should pay the attorneys' fees in the proportion that it benefited. The court found that while the diversion to the county of tax funds levied by the municipalities and taxing districts might serve to reduce the taxes levied for the county, it also served, in varying degrees, to increase the burden on those taxpayers who paid taxes to the municipalities and taxing districts. The court reversed and concluded that the economic benefit of the prevention of the unlawful diversion was not the same to all taxpayers and that plaintiffs' attorneys prevented the unlawful diversion of funds to the county and were entitled to an allowance of fees.</SPAN></P>

The complaint sought a declaratory judgment that certain of the telephone company's revenues were exempt from taxation under the Messages Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 467.1 et seq. (1971).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Although the telephone company did not exhaust its administrative remedy available under the Messages Tax Act, Ill.

(1973), it asserted that its action was proper because it was brought in equity to enjoin the imposition of an illegal, unauthorized, and invalid tax. The court held that the trial court erred in ordering the 20-day statute tolled. However, the court noted that at the time these erroneous orders were entered, the telephone company still had time to comply with the 20-day statute, and its failure to do so resulted from its reliance on the trial court's orders. Because the telephone company constructively complied with the 20-day statute, such compliance prevented the notices of tax liability from ripening into final assessments at the expiration of 20 days.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission relied upon the Medical Center Act, Ill. Rev.

Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 801 (1973), which provided that the state could not be made a defendant in any court except as provided in the act creating the court of claims. The victim argued that the section of the medical center act relied upon by the commission was unconstitutional because it violated the victim's right to seek compensation for injuries in a court of law. The court affirmed and held that the commission was an arm of the state and the immunity granted by the general assembly was authorized by Ill. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 4.

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-20 (1971), unconstitutional and dismissed four complaints charging defendants with obscenity. The complaints charged that defendants exhibited an obscene motion picture, an untitled underground co-feature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both the judgment of the circuit court and the filing of the People's brief in the court preceded the announcement of the court's second opinion in a decision dealing with the obscenity statute. The court had construed para. 11-20 to incorporate parts (a) and (b) of a standard announced in the United States Supreme Court's decision in Miller rather than a standard in the Supreme Court's decision in Memoirs. Under the Miller standards, the basic guidelines were (a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appealed to the prurient interest, and (b) whether the work depicted or described, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law. The court determined that its construction could not be applied retroactively if to do so rendered its construction less favorable to defendants. However, the court reversed and concluded that at this time, it was unable to say whether and in what manner the statute as now construed was less favorable to defendants than as formerly construed. Therefore, the court found no impediment to its retroactive application in this case.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court set aside the superintendent's order, and an appeal by the superintendent and others was dismissed for want of jurisdiction on findings that there was no jurisdiction for the bringing of the administrative review proceeding in the circuit court. On review, the court found that although only supporters of the petition had the right under the Act to seek review, it did not follow that such a provision was unconstitutional because objectors to the petition had numerous other legal remedies available. The court found that the circuit court had no jurisdiction to review the decision under the Act, and that it erred in setting aside the order granting the petition. It held that the net effect of the appellate court's dismissal of the appeal was to leave the circuit court order in full force and effect, and that a proper order would have reversed the circuit court's judgment and remanded the case with directions to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>

After plaintiffs obtained a judgment against the driver of the rented vehicle, plaintiffs commenced an action against defendant, which had issued to the car rental agency the automobile liability policy covering the automobile rented by the driver.

Defendant owed to the driver no debt or obligation that could have been garnished, and the garnishment action was properly dismissed. The classification created by 95 Ill. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff diocese sued defendants, a bishop and a monastery, seeking removal of the bishop and a validation of a diocesan reorganization into three new dioceses. The bishop and the monastery counterclaimed for injunctive relief to prevent interference with the monastery's property. The Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) validated the removal of the bishop and invalidated the reorganization of the diocese. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a contest for control of property, the bishop challenged the validity of his defrockment, the monastery and the diocese argued that the relationship between the diocese and an orthodox church was terminated by the reorganization, and the diocese contended that its holy assembly had the power to reorganize into three new dioceses. The court's standard of review of church tribunal decisions was of the narrowest kind, for fraud, collusion, or arbitrariness. Nevertheless, the court concluded that the defrockment violated provisions of the constitution and the penal code of the orthodox church . Therefore, the bishop's suspension was ineffective. The lower courts properly decided the issue of the reorganization adversely to the diocese, based on clear provisions regarding administrative autonomy in both the diocesan and the orthodox church constitutions. The holy assembly's reorganization was clearly in excess of its jurisdiction. The reorganization attempt did not sever the relationship of the orthodox church and the diocese because it did not sever their basic religious unanimity, and their constitutions did not permit unilateral withdrawal from their relationship..</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">That part of the judgment holding that the bishop's defrockment was valid was reversed. That part of the judgment holding that the division of the diocese into three new dioceses was illegal and unenforceable was affirmed. The cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held unconstitutional that section of the municipal code authorizing summary suspension for up to 30 days without hearing. The court reversed and remanded.

On remand, the court affirmed the judgments again and held that the Illinois statute and city ordinance were not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad in light of recent case law. The court defined obscenity as follows: (a) the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appealed to a prurient interest in sex; (b) the material was patently offensive, as it affronted contemporary community standards for the description or representation of sexual matters; and (c) the material was utterly without redeeming social value.

The court affirmed, holding that the ordinance did not meet the requirements of &sect; 15 of the Illinois Nursing Home Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 35.30 (1969). The circuit court had jurisdiction to decide the validity of the ordinance. The ordinance's reference to the administrative review by the state department of health did not bar judicial review of the enabling act under which the ordinance was enacted. The actions presented an administrative review proceeding and a &quot;justiciable matter&quot; over which Ill. Const. of 1870, art. VI, &sect; 9, vested the circuit court with jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals affirming the judgment of the circuit court finding that the local ordinance was invalid and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

At trial, his wife and a neighbor testified that defendant was at home during the time of the robbery. Prior to trial, the People filed a motion to produce under the alibi defense statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 114-14 (1969), which required a defendant intending to rely on an alibi to provide specific information no later than five days before trial as to the place and names of witnesses. Defendant filed a list naming five persons he planned to call. At the close of the People's case, he made a motion for the production of any statements the People had taken from his alibi witnesses. The trial court denied the motion, but the appellate court held that it was error and reversed the conviction. On appeal, the court held that the alibi statute was unconstitutional because it denied due process, as it did not provide for discovery of the People's alibi-rebuttal witnesses. Although the alibi statute was unconstitutional, such holding did not require reversal. Because the evidence was overwhelming in proving defendant's guilt, he was not harmed by the denial of his motion for the production of statements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company entered into an agreement with a contractor under which the contractor was to design, develop, fabricate, furnish, and deliver two large steam-generating units for a new power plant being constructed for the company. The contractor in turn hired a subcontractor for the unloading and erecting work. The decedent was employed by the subcontractor and was killed while unloading component parts of a steam generator from a railroad car on the company's property. The company argued that the unloading of a piece of equipment in a storage yard a half mile away from the site where the equipment was to be assembled did not constitute structural work within the purview of the Structural Work Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, paras. 60-69 (1963). In noting that the Act should be given a liberal construction, the court held that the appellate court properly found that, under the terms of the contract, the unloading could be fairly viewed as an integral part of the erection operation.

The trial court later ordered that all funds that were in the possession or control of the townships or their officers on a certain date be disbursed to the trustee that had been appointed by the court. The trial court stated that it would entertain petitions for fees and cost and, after the deduction thereof, all funds in the possession or control of the trustee would then be disbursed to the county collector. The trial court allowed fees of $ 750,000 to the attorneys over the objection of the treasurer. The appellate court affirmed, and the treasurer received leave to appeal.

Later, a permanent injunction was issued, and that judgment was appealed as well. The appeals were consolidated, and the judgments reversed. The court held that, contrary to the residents' contention, the statute that authorized the agency's creation was not unconstitutional. Although the state constitution did contain regulations about legislative delegation of its authority and the accumulation of state debt, the authorizing statute did not violate these provisions because it did not in itself authorize the creation of debt and because the agency was a creature of local government rather than of state government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation and its majority shareholder proceeded under the provisions of the Illinois Business Corporation Act (Act), and, considering the record, the court held that the lower court properly entered judgment for them. Although minority shareholders were not denied relief under all circumstances when the majority proceeded under the provisions of the Act, the court found that the minority shareholder failed to show grounds for the relief sought. The Act authorized the corporation to amend its articles, acquire its own shares and reclassify stocks for the purpose of eliminating fractional shares. The Act did not require that the corporation issue certificates for the fractional shares but gave it the authority to pay cash for the shares in lieu of issuing certificates. These statutory provisions existed at the time the minority shareholder acquired her shares, and there was no unconstitutional impairment of contractual rights, a denial of due process, or a denial of equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

The court found that Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 4(b) conferred authority to classify real property and that counties described in the provisions did not need enabling legislation in order to classify. The court held that the assessor, without securing authority from the county board, was permitted to continue to classify real property the same way it was done prior to the 1970 constitutional amendment. In affirming, the court held that the amendment had a retroactive effect and operated to ratify the de facto practice of classifying that had existed in Cook County at the time the new constitution was adopted. The court found that the words &quot;continue to classify&quot; showed the constitutional delegates' unmistakable intention to ratify the past practice. The court held that the classifications were not unreasonable or arbitrary because counties with more than 200,000 residents would be more complex and contain industrial, commercial, and residential areas.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted the Governor's motion for summary judgment. The disqualified persons appealed. The court held that &sect; 1A-2 did not violate the disqualified persons' rights to equal protection. The State's purpose in limiting membership on the Board to persons not actively engaged in or connected with any school or school system was to prevent any potential conflict of interests. The State had a legitimate interest in acting to accomplish this goal. Disqualification from Board membership of all persons associated with any school or school system was a reasonable method of doing this. Thus, the classification was valid.

After the trial court affirmed the validity of the order and a financial disclosure statement but held certain parts of the financial statement invalid, both parties appealed. The court reversed the order which held parts of the financial statement invalid. An overly broad disclosure was a disclosure of more matters or more detail than was necessary to accomplish the purpose of a branch of government. Whether a particular disclosure was necessary to accomplish the purposes of the executive order was primarily a matter for the executive branch to determine. Nothing in the record justified the conclusion that the board's determination was unreasonable. The court affirmed the judgment that sustained validity of the order.

The circuit court found defendant not guilty of involuntary manslaughter and guilty of reckless homicide. The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction, holding that Ill. Rev.

The state appealed. The court reversed the decision of the appellate court, holding that the discretion committed to the state's attorney to determine whether to charge a defendant with involuntary manslaughter or reckless homicide was not an unconstitutional delegation of authority.

Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, par. 1009(a) (1971), and remanded the cause to the board for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The agency filed a complaint against the city alleging that the city was permitting a sewerage lagoon to emit obnoxious odors causing air pollution in violation of par. 1009(a) of the Act. The board found that city was in violation thereof, imposed a fine, ordered the city to submit to the agency plans detailing a program to eliminate the odors, and ordered the city to cease and desist from causing air pollution. The appellate court reversed the order and remanded the case to the board. All parties petitioned for leave to appeal. The court affirmed the judgment in part and reversed it in part. The fines authorized by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, pars. 1033(b) and 1042 (1971) were not criminal sanctions. Thus, the city was not entitled to a jury trial. Section 9 of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, par. 1009 (1971) was not unconstitutional because when read in conjunction with other provisions of the Act, it contained sufficient standards. The board's finding that the city violated the Act was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. However, the board erred in imposing a fine because the city co-operated in implementing all of the agency's proposals.</SPAN></P>

The cause was remanded to the Board for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Each of the banks' five actions were consolidated in the trial court and all matters were consolidated on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two banks filed actions against the county taxing officials, alleging excessive assessments and illegal classifications of real estate. The circuit court dismissed all complaints. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that where a plaintiff alleged irregularities and violations of its constitutional rights due to an excessive assessment, the legal remedy by way of payment under protest followed by objections to the application for judgment for delinquent taxes provided an adequate remedy at law. The court noted that the taxation of property was a legislative and not a judicial function and that it would not review the assessment of property unless the assessments were fraudulent or constructively fraudulent. The court rejected the banks' contention that the Cook County Board of Commissioners had to take action regarding classification of real estate or such a classification was invalid. The court found that the proceedings and debates of the constitutional convention indicated that the drafters of the Illinois Constitution of 1970 did not include a requirement that classification of real property be made by the governing body of the county and not by an assessor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A grand jury returned indictments charging defendant with aggravated kidnapping, attempted murder, aggravated battery, armed robbery, and armed violence. Defendant's motion to set a bond was denied by the circuit court, and defendant sought review of that action in the appellate court. The appellate court entered an order declaring the charged bailable under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 (1970). The appellate court remanded the cause with directions to conduct a hearing and fix bail. The State filed a petition for leave to appeal from the appellate court order, which was allowed. On appeal, the court held that in view of the fact that the issue underlying the appellate court order was moot, coupled with the unlikelihood that it would have again arisen as new legislation, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 1005-8-1A (1973), again provided for imposition of the death penalty, the court found it unnecessary to pass on the merits of the question. The court considered it desirable to vacate the order since its effect touched upon a question about which the court expressed no opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff allegedly sustained injuries when she fell on snow and ice that accumulated on the bleachers of a high school football field owned by the diocese. Plaintiff filed a personal injury complaint against the diocese and alleged negligence. Plaintiff did not allege that she gave the diocese notice of the accident. The circuit court dismissed the complaint on the ground that it was barred by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 822-24 (1967), which required notice within six months of the injury. The appellate court affirmed the judgment. Reversing, the court held that the notice and limitations provisions of the Illinois School Tort Liability Act was invalid as to both public and nonprofit private schools. The court held that the notice and limitations provisions could not have been fairly applied in this case, even though they had not been specifically invalidated as to nonprofit private schools. The court noted that the Illinois Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act now contained a one-year notice requirement and a two-year statute of limitation as opposed to the six-month and one-year requirements of the School Tort Liability Act.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded the judgment and found that the taxpayer was obligated to seek relief under the Administrative Review Act (review act) and had proceeded improperly when it sought injunctive relief in the circuit court. The court held that &sect; 12 of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act (tax act) provided that all proceedings for the judicial review of final administrative decisions of the tax department were governed by the tax act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 451 (1969).

The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the Ticket Scalping Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch.121-1/2, para. 157.32 (1971), was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court overruled a previous decision in which it held that the legislature lacked authority to control the resale price of amusement tickets. The court held that the Ticket Scalping Act did not violate the Due Process Clauses of either the Illinois Constitution or the United States Constitution. However, the court applied its decision prospectively and affirmed the trial court's decision to dismiss the complaint against defendant because the overruled decision, which held that a statute nearly identical to the Ticket Scalping Act was unconstitutional, carried considerable if not conclusive weight, particularly as tested by the provisions of the Illinois Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court considered whether the rules defining the eligibility of a candidate for public office in terms of a two-year &quot;no-switch&quot; rule were unconstitutional. The court noted that the legislature provided substantially similar restrictions for three categories: voters, voters who signed primary nominating petitions, and voters who intended to be candidates. The first two categories were found to have been constitutionally impermissible. Therefore, the court concluded that the restrictive provisions were so closely related that the legislature would not have enacted the portion relating to candidates apart from restrictions upon voters generally and those voters who desired to sign primary petitions. Because the restrictions upon candidates were not independent and severable from the invalid portions of the plan, the court concluded that the third restriction was also unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, The Pollution Control Board, challenged a judgment from the Appellate Court for the Second District (Illinois), which reversed an order from the Board that imposed a discretionary fine on appellees, City of Waukegen and disposal corporations (city), for, inter alia, operating a refuse disposal site without obtaining a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) filed a complaint against the city charging various violations of the Environmental Protection Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2 (1971), including a charge of having operated a refuse disposal site without obtaining a permit from the EPA. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1021(e). The Board fined the city and the city appealed pursuant to the Act, Ill Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1041 (1971), and the Administrative Review Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 264 et seq. (1971). The appellate court reversed the judgment and on appeal by the Board, the court reversed. The court found that the Board was to conduct hearings and if violations were found it was to impose penalties. The court found that the procedures for judicial review of Board decisions were adequate to provide a check on the power of the Board to ensure it was not excessive. The court found that the imposition of a discretionary fine by the Board was not an unlawful delegation of judicial power. The court held that the Board's assessment of monetary powers was not a violation of the constitutional requirement of a separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 901-903. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's ruling in both cases. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional because it only set forth the titles of the 30 acts to which it made reference. Because the statute attempted to remove existing provisions from some of the 30 acts referenced authorizing concurrent municipal regulations, the court held that the statute violated Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d), which required that the sections being amended be completely set forth in the bill. The court also held that the statute violated &sect; 8(d), which provided that all bills should be confined to one subject. The court noted that this rule applied to Public Act 77-1818 because the statute was not a codification of existing law but instead referenced 30 separate acts that each dealt with the separate subject of the licensing and regulation of a particular profession, vocation, or occupation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was 17 years old at the time of the offenses. The court determined that sex was a suspect classification and applied strict scrutiny to the statute. The court reversed the appellate court's judgment and affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that there was no compelling state interest justifying treating a 17-year-old boy differently from a 17-year-old girl under the Juvenile Court Act. Thus, the provision was invalid. The court held that the invalid classification should be deleted, thus rendering the statute inapplicable to both males and females who were not under the age of 17 years.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court found that the ordinance adopted by defendants was unconstitutional and invalid because the firefighters were not allowed to earn their maximum pension in violation of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, article XIII, &sect; 5 because the ordinance diminished and impaired their pension rights.

The department of revenue and state officials urged that the statute was based upon reasonable classifications and therefore was considered general legislation. The court noted that the prohibition against special legislation did not require that a law had to affect every person alike, but instead a law was required to uniformly operate throughout the state on all localities and persons in like circumstances and conditions. The court further explained that it was not impermissible for the legislature to differentiate between classes to which a law applied so long as there was a reasonable basis for the classification. The court reversed the judgment, concluding that a reasonable basis for the refund statute existed. The court found that the differentiation between persons who paid taxes upon automobiles and those who paid tax on other chattel purchases was reasonable because it was based upon the repeal of a federal automobile excise tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county's board of commissioners adopted the wheel-tax ordinance on December 30, 1971, to become effective on January 1, 1972. Plaintiffs filed a complaint challenging the ordinance's constitutionality in their individual and representative capacity on behalf of all others similarly situated. Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary injunction restraining the treasurer from disbursing or distributing the monies collected. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied. The trial court entered judgment for plaintiffs. Defendants sought review of the judgment with the appellate court. The court ordered that the appeal be directly taken to it under Ill. Sup. Ct.

The ordinance was a taxing measure and was within the power of the county under &sect;6(a).

The trial court disagreed and granted a mandatory injunction to the national church. The appeals court, however, agreed with the local church's argument. The national church appealed. The court analyzed the structure of the national church and found that because the local church was a subordinate of the national church, and had consented to its rules, it was bound by its decisions and a civil court was without the authority to order otherwise.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitions were filed in the juvenile court division charging defendants, who were 14 and 15 years old, with being delinquents in connection with the crime. Based on the testimony of the coroner as to the cause of death and the investigator as to defendants' statements, the juvenile court found that further detention was necessary. The State then petitioned to transfer the case to the trial court for trial of defendants as adult offenders pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, paras. 702-2, 702-7, and 702-8 (1967). Based on evidence taken in the detention hearing, the juvenile court granted the petition. Neither defendants nor their parents objected to the transfers. Defendants entered guilty pleas in the trial court. On appeal, the court found that the Illinois legislature reasonably vested in the State's Attorney, rather than a juvenile court judge in a judicial proceeding, the responsibility of deciding whether an offender should be proceeded against as an adult or as a juvenile. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, paras. 702-2, 702-7, and 702-8 (1967) were constitutional. The trial court considered defendants' ages in determining their sentences, which were not excessive in light of the crime.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 91 1/2, para. 15-1(1971). Judgment was entered prior to trial upon defendants' motion to dismiss on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with striking a patient in a state mental hospital. They contended that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91 1/2, para. 15-1(1971) was violative of the Illinois and United States Constitutions because it was vague, indefinite, and uncertain and that neither the word &quot;maltreat&quot; nor the phrase &quot;person in need of mental treatment&quot; were sufficiently definitive. The circuit court agreed and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of dismissal. The court held that the term &quot;maltreat&quot; was not so vague or indefinite as to be constitutionally void when coupled with a specific description of the acts that constituted maltreatment. The complaint left no doubt as to the nature of the conduct that formed the basis for the charge. Similarly, the term &quot;person in need of mental treatment&quot; did not fail to give adequate notice of the class of persons protected, and the complaint's language made it clear that the victim was a member of the statute's protected class. The court found that the presumption of constitutionality was not rebutted because the statute was clearly and understandably applicable to the facts alleged in the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Chapter 43, para. 158 of the Act imposed a privilege tax upon the distributors of wine made from grapes grown in Illinois at a lower rate than imposed upon distributors of wine made from grapes grown outside of Illinois. The wine distributors filed an action challenging the differential tax. The Act was amended, eliminating the tax differential and imposing an indirect tax upon importers of foreign liquors. The trial court held that the tax differential in the statute prior to amendment had been unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court, holding that neither the old Act nor the amended Act was unconstitutional. The court held that the Act did not violate the import-export clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 2, because the Webb-Kenyon Act and the Wilson Act, 27 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 121, 122, authorized such a tax. The court held that the wine distributors were not entitled to a tax refund because there was no evidence that they bore the burden of the tax, so such a refund would have unjustly enriched them.

In so ruling, the court determined the implementation of Public Act 77-1895, might give rise to extremely serious constitutional questions because it was possible that the activities of nonpublic schools would be subject to the fiscal control of the public school district or public school teachers, with resulting entanglement; and it was also possible that those activities, financed with public funds and conducted in the nonpublic schools, would go without supervision. The court also ruled that (1) portions of the Public Act 77-1891 required the provision of auxiliary services that were not susceptible of supervision to assure a strictly secular content and (2) Public Act 77-1890 was invalid because there was no endeavor to guarantee the separation between secular and religious educational functions and to ensure that state financial aid supported only the former.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with soliciting a homeowner to sell his residential property after defendant had received notice that the homeowner did not desire to do so, in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 70-51(d) (1969). The notice allegedly afforded to defendant was based on &sect; 4.1 of the Act, which required that owners of residential property who did not want to be solicited could fill out notice forms that were then distributed to real estate agents in the &quot;area&quot; who were &quot;known or believed&quot; to be soliciting owners for the sale of their property. The circuit court found that &sect; 70-51(d) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the statute did not define what constituted an area, did not specifically state who had the authority to create a list of agents to receive notice or how such persons should form their beliefs and knowledge. The court determined that the statute constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to the Human Relations Commission because it gave it too much power to interpret the law.

Stat. ch. 38, para. 22--3 (1965). His conviction was affirmed on appeal. Defendant filed a post-conviction petition that the circuit court dismissed. Subsequently, the court determined that the classification of marijuana as a drug covered by the Narcotic Drug Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 22--1 et seq., was unconstitutional. On appeal from the dismissal of the post-conviction petition, the court reversed and remanded with directions to vacate the judgment of conviction. The court concluded that the holding invalid of the statute upon which defendant's conviction rested required the vacation of the judgment even though the issue of its constitutionality was raised for the first time in the post-conviction proceeding. The court determined that considerations of justice and fairness required the reversal of defendant's conviction. The court indicated that there was no waiver of defendant's right to raise the issue of unconstitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted the motion with an order that the county sheriff was enjoined from requiring advance payment of a fee for service of process on behalf of defendants in criminal actions. The attorney general appealed. The court had jurisdiction for direct appeal pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 302(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, represented by a private attorney, presented at least 12 subpoenas to the county sheriff's department for service. The county sheriff's department refused to serve them without fee payment in advance. The court found the trial court's order simply enjoined the collection in advance of fees as a condition to the serving of subpoenas for a defendant under a criminal charge. The court found the county sheriff had a right to charge a fee and mileage to serve subpoenas under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 53, para. 71 (1971). Further, the court found that an administrative order of the county sheriff pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 53, para. 74(4) (1971) required advance payment before the county sheriff would serve a subpoena in a criminal matter. The court held that an indigent defendant in such a criminal matter had the right to a waiver of service fees but that a non-indigent did not. In setting aside the trial court's order, the court found the trial court erred in holding as unconstitutional not only the county sheriff's administrative order requiring advance payment of fees by defendants in criminal cases but also, by indirection, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 53, para. 74(4) (1971).</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 63b101 et seq. (1971) under which the defendant had purported to act, were unconstitutional. The trial court granted a temporary injunction and the director sought review of the order. The court affirmed and held that the complaint was a proper class action because Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, paras. 23, 44 (1971) permitted a single action to be maintained by several persons claiming that they were discharged from the same department at the same time and for the same reason.

The appellate court held that the superintendent lacked authority under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 11-6 (1967) to find that a petition requesting an election to establish a community school district was sufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The superintendent determined that a petition requesting an election to establish a community unit school district was sufficient. His order found that the population of the proposed district was more than 1,750 persons but less than 4,000 and that additional action by the Superintendent of Public Instruction was necessary in order to call an election pursuant to &sect; 11-6 of the School Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 11-6 (1967). Plaintiffs filed an action for administrative review. The trial court affirmed the superintendent's order. On appeal, the appellate court reversed. The superintendent sought review. While the appeal was pending, the process for changing district boundaries was changed by the legislature. The supreme court concluded that no rights vested under the old procedure for the creation of a community unit school district. The legislature eliminated procedural distinctions in the organization of districts of different size populations. The court ruled that para. 11-6 was not unconstitutional because of vagueness; and the school superintendent had the authority to call for an election.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, paras. 499, 532.1-532.6 (1972), were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

All of defendants appealed, however the county officials did not participate in the appeal with regard to &sect; 18(b). On appeal, the court affirmed all three judgments. The court considered the legislative history and the statutory language and held that Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 5(c) (1970) constituted a mandate to the Illinois General Assembly to abolish the ad valorem personal property taxes on or before January 1, 1979, and to replace all revenue lost by that abolition by imposing statewide taxes on those classes relieved of the burden of the taxes abolished. The court found the exemptions from personal property tax in the challenged statutes for farm use property, personal household furniture, one personal automobile, and the individual and corporate standard tax deductions, constituted abolition of the taxes for those classes. Yet, the court held the General Assembly failed to establish a replacement tax at the same time it granted those exemptions and deductions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that one brother had knowingly consented to the autopsy and that the other brother had no notice that an autopsy was to be performed and had not consented to its being done. On appeal, the issues were whether the Autopsy Act was unconstitutional because it permitted one surviving relative to authorize an autopsy, and because it did not require notification of, and authorization by, all the surviving relatives. Upon review, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The provision that an autopsy could have been authorized by one of two or more persons with equal right to determine the method for disposing of the body did not abolish, restrict, or abridge any common-law right which the brothers enjoyed. The common-law right was the right to bury decently, and there was no requirement of unanimity on the part of those who were of equal status concerning the place or mode of burial. The statute provided adequate safeguards for the rights of the survivors, and was not violative of due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, the Director of the Department of Revenue of the State of Illinois and the Treasurer of the State of Illinois, appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), in favor of plaintiff boat owner. The circuit court determined that &sect; 2 of the Motor Fuel Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 418 (1971) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute imposed a tax on the privilege of operating a motor vehicle on the waters of the State of Illinois at a specified rate per gallon of gasoline used. The boat owner brought an action on behalf of all boat owners who were charged the motor fuel tax on their purchases of gasoline for marine use. The trial court held that the challenged portion of &sect; 2 of the Motor Fuel Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 418 (1971) unreasonably discriminated between operators of gasoline-powered boats and operators of diesel-powered boats, and therefore violated the equal-protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the uniformity provision of Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1. On appeal, the court held that the statutory classification was not unreasonable. The legislature could have intended to tax those boaters for whose benefit the state's boating program was primarily designed. It could have concluded that a tax on the marine use of diesel fuel would produce little revenue above the costs of collection and administration and that, as to sailboats, no method existed for measuring their use of the waterways. Such considerations furnished a justification for legislative classification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment, which had been in favor of the boat owner and against the state officials, and which had found that the motor fuel tax on purchases of gasoline for marine use was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent, the Director of Insurance, appealed a decision from the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois), which reversed a judgment denying petitioner policyholder the right to intervene in the liquidation proceedings of an insolvent mutual insurance company. Plaintiff creditors appealed a decision that affirmed the dismissal of plaintiffs' action to force respondent to resume collection of assessments against the policyholders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because of similarity of issues, the court consolidated two appeals concerning the rights of petitioner policyholder and plaintiff creditors to participate in liquidation proceedings by respondent, the Director of Insurance, against an insolvent mutual insurance company. The court first determined that respondent improperly applied a statute repealing his authority to collect assessments against policyholders for claims against the insolvent company retrospectively where such operation did not clearly appear from the language of the statute. The court then concluded that petitioner policyholder and plaintiff creditors had a right to intervene in the liquidation proceedings because respondent was unable to adequately represent their interests in proceedings that could adversely affect them. The liquidation proceedings, however, rather than independent actions, were the proper forum for those issues. Therefore, the court affirmed a decision allowing petitioner policyholder to intervene in the liquidation proceedings and a decision dismissing plaintiff creditors' independent action against respondent and requiring them to present their claims in the liquidation proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ill. Pub. Act 77-2819, codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 42, paras. 247, 251, 253, 254, 263, 273b-273g. (1973 Supp.), had the effect of dividing a sanitary district into two separate districts. Appellee original sanitary district sought a declaratory judgment and injunction to have the amendatory legislation declared unconstitutional and the governor restrained from making the appointments of trustees provided for by that legislation. Appellant filed a complaint in another circuit for injunctive relief, which that circuit court granted. The original court held that the legislation was unconditional. The court allowed a motion of the original court to file a petition of mandamus and prohibition directed at the other circuit court. The court affirmed the original court's judgment and held that the act was special legislation and that, pursuant to Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13, the general assembly could not have passed a special law when a general law could have been made applicable. The court found that a general law could have been made applicable, and that Ill. Pub. Act 77-2819 therefore violated the constitution's prohibition against special legislation.</SPAN></P>

Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 29-4 (1971) required plaintiff to provide the same transportation along its regular bus routes for nonpublic school pupils as it provided for public school pupils. The court affirmed the judgments of the trial court that the statute did not violate Ill. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The housing authority claimed that it had given the tenant the statutorily required notice and that the tenant had failed to pay the rent due.

As an affirmative defense the tenant alleged that her income had been reduced, that the authority's agent had offered to relieve her of the penalty for late payment if she paid part of the rent before the sixth day of each month and the balance before the end of the month, and that she had tendered the balance but the tender was refused. On appeal, the court held that the counterclaim should not have been dismissed because the action for possession was based upon nonpayment of rent and the question of whether the tenant owed rent was germane, whether or not the authority sought judgment for the rent that it claimed was due.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court found the ordinance unconstitutional and enjoined the appointee from taking office. The court held that the Board was constitutionally vested with the authority to supplant an existing statute with an ordinance specifically providing that it was intended to supersede it. Such authority was found in Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4(c), which permitted a home-rule county to create new offices and appoint certain officers by county ordinance.

The court also held that &sect; 2 -- 8 of the Juvenile Court Act, which addressed the sealing of juvenile court records, should not have been construed as prohibiting access to the accomplice's juvenile records because defendant validly sought them for the purpose of impeaching the accomplice by showing a possible motive for testifying falsely because he was promised leniency in exchange for testifying. The court further opined that defendant would have been able to cross-examine the accomplice as to any agreement that was entered in exchange for his testimony if the accomplice was an adult.

Rev. Stat. ch. 24, paras. 11-95-1 to 11-95-14 (1971), which lay outside, but immediately next to the village's corporate limits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village filed a petition in the trial court and sought to condemn approximately 127 acres of land lying outside of, but immediately adjacent to the village's corporate limits for a playground and recreation center. The landowners opposed the condemnation. The trial court denied the village's petition. The village sought review. On appeal, the court held: (1) Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-95-1 (1971) authorized the purchase of the land; however, nothing in the statute authorized the taking of the property by eminent domain; (2) Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-61-1 (1971) permitted the village to use the powers of eminent domain in conformity with Illinois law; (3) the legislature had the authority to grant the village the power of condemnation over property lying beyond its borders; (4) as proof of necessity, the village established a prima facie case when it introduced evidence that it needed the recreational center; and (5) the record showed that the village did offer to first purchase the property and the landowners made no response, and thus sufficiently established an attempt to acquire the property without condemnation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order of the trial court, held that the legislature granted the village the authority to condemn the landowners' property, and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 23-1 (1963), in light of constitutional considerations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with performing abortions during the first trimester of pregnancy. The second defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment had been granted, but the first defendant had been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment. The second defendant had not been a licensed physician in Illinois on the date he had performed the alleged abortion. The key issue was the impact of the Roe standard on the Illinois statute. The court found that: (1) under the Roe standard, it was improper to regulate abortions within the first trimester of pregnancy and it was improper to prohibit abortion except where necessary to preserve the mother's life or health unless the fetus was viable; (2) the Illinois statute unduly restricted the legal justification for an abortion and completely failed to distinguish when an abortion could be performed under the Roe standard; (3) the statute further improperly prohibited the performance of abortions without distinction between physicians and laypersons without regard to medical necessity; (4) the entire statute was unconstitutional; and (5) convictions based on that statute were improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment with respect to the first defendant and affirmed the granting of the motion to dismiss in the case of the second defendant.</SPAN></P>

However, the trial court found that the invalidity of the exemption did not render the entire ordinance invalid and dismissed plaintiffs' complaint. Both plaintiffs and the city challenged the trial court's decision. The court reversed the trial court's decision that the exemption of certain residential parking was invalid and affirmed the dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint. The court determined that the tax was one imposed pursuant to the home-rule power to tax conferred by Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6 (1970). The court found no merit in plaintiffs' contention that the provision of the ordinance providing for the payment of fixed amounts of taxes for those who paid for their parking on a weekly or monthly basis violated the uniformity provision of the constitution.

Section 6(a) provided that a home rule unit may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs. The collection of property taxes was not a power or function pertaining to the government and affairs of the county because, in collecting and distributing tax monies, the county acted both for itself and for the other taxing bodies authorized to tax property within the county.

The investor contended that he was entitled to a refund of the taxes and that the county treasurer was personally liable for the improperly assessed taxes. The court held that the investor could not recoup the taxes from the county because the investor accepted the proceeds from the condemnation less the prorated taxes without oral or written protest and failed to seek relief from the taxes under &sect; 14 of the Eminent Domain Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 47, para. 14 (1967) The court also held that the county treasurer was not personally liable for the taxes because the county treasurer was a public official and acted pursuant to a statute that was in effect for several years.</SPAN></P>

Some of the purchasers filed timely notices of appeal, but the trial court dismissed their appeals because of their failure to file appeal bonds. Other purchasers failed to file their notices of appeal within the five-day statutory period, and their appeals were also dismissed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that insofar as &sect; 18 of the Forcible Entry and Detainer Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 57, para. 19 (1969), required the filing of an appeal bond as a prerequisite to prosecuting an appeal, it violated Ill. Const. of 1870 art. VI, &sect; 7 and Ill. Const. of 1970 art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A complaint charged defendant with interfering with a public instantiation in violation of &sect; 21.2-2. Defendant allegedly refusal to depart from a university building when told to do so by a university peace officer. In a motion to dismiss, defendant argued that the statute was vague and overbroad in violation of U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV and Ill. Const. of 1970, art. I. &sect;&sect; 2, 4 and 5. The trial court found that the statute was unconstitutional on its face. On appeal, the court found that the definition of the offense was verbose and redundant, but was not ambiguous or vague. A person committed the offense when, without authority from the institution, he, through force or violence, actual or threatened, knowingly occupied or remained in or at any university building, after receiving due notice to depart. Also, the statutory definition of &quot;force or violence&quot; was not overbroad and the complaint alleged that defendant had notice from an authorized official. Thus, the statutory definition of the proscribed conduct made it possible to charge its violation with sufficient specificity to leave no doubt as to the precise nature of the misconduct upon which the prosecution was based.</SPAN></P>

There was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have concluded that defendant was legally sane at the time of the offense. Defendant further alleged that the conviction should have been overturned because of the trial court's pretrial discovery rulings. The court held that the trial court did not commit reversible error regarding the rulings. Finally, the court held that even though the trial court did make evidentiary rulings during the trial court were erroneous, the proof was so convincing that the jury would have found defendant guilty even if there had been no errors.

The trustees also sought damages for breach of the demolition contract. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and held that the statute of limitations did not apply to the action because the certificates were issued prior to its effective date. The court also found that the trial court's decision that the company complied with the provision of the contracts requiring a certain grade of fill material was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The litigation had been appealed twice previously. In the first appeal the court directed that all property taxes in the county had to be collected by the county collector. In the second appeal the court held that although the township collectors were de jure officers, the lack of funds from which their salaries and expenses could have been paid resulted in a practical inability to act and the county collector assumed the burden of the collection of taxes. On review the court noted that the briefs reflected the disagreement of the parties, but upon the record it did not have to reach the question of whether a township, by action of the board of town auditors, could have provided for the salary and expenses of the town collector, and the effect of such action insofar as it affected the practical inability of the town collectors to function. The court held that in consideration of the motion to dissolve the injunction the trial court was required to determine whether changes had occurred since its rendition that were of sufficient importance to warrant its dissolution. The court finally held that mandamus would not have issued to compel an act that was of no practical benefit.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the racing association continued to assert that the statute was ambiguous and unconstitutional. The court rejected the racing association's arguments. First, it noted that the statute was not ambiguous, as there was no language that indicated that it did not apply to operations conducted on private property. As to the argument that the statute was invalid, the court found that the statute did not discriminate because it exempted the governmental unit and not-for-profit operations from its requirements, as separate classifications for taxing purposes were not discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted on a jury verdict finding him guilty of aggravated battery in that he knowingly and without justification struck a police officer, causing him bodily harm. He was sentenced to imprisonment for not less than one nor more than three years. Defendant appealed, contending that the statute under which he was convicted, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-4 (1969), was unconstitutional because it deprived him of equal protection and due process of law. He also contended that his right to a fair trial was denied by certain statements and questions put forward by the prosecution. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding first that para. 12-4 was not unconstitutionally vague. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-4(b) had always included a number of subparagraphs, and the penalty clause was always in the last of the subparagraphs. The fact that a semicolon was left out of the 1968 amendment to para. 12-4(b) did not render it unconstitutionally vague. In addition, it was permissible to impose a greater punishment for an assault upon a peace officer. Finally, defendant waived any error with respect to the prosecution's questions and statements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayer sought review of a judgment entered in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that granted defendant government agency's motion to dismiss the taxpayer's complaint, which sought to enjoin the government agency from implementing an agreement with an educational facility that was entered into pursuant to the Illinois Educational Facilities Authority Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 144, para. 1301 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court dismissed the taxpayer's complaint to enjoin the government agency from implementing an agreement it had entered into with a private religious educational organization for the financing and construction of a facility pursuant to the Illinois Educational Facilities Authority Act. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that, by making tax exempt bonds available for the use and benefit of private sectarian institutions of higher learning, the government agency was violating U.S. Const. amend I, XIV and Ill. Const. art. X, &sect; 3, which prohibited government from using public funds to help or support or sustain any private or sectarian educational institution. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument. The court noted that to be consistent with the Establishment Clause, any aid to religiously affiliated schools had to have a secular purpose, a primary effect that neither advanced nor inhibited religion, and did not give rise to an excessive entanglement between the government and religion. The court found that application of these principles to the facts of this case did not demonstrate an excessive entanglement between the government and religion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the savings association defaulted, the insurer paid insurance to the savings association's withdrawable capital account holders and in return was granted an assignment of those holders' rights, titles, and interest in the accounts. Thereafter, the insurer sought interest on the accounts. The trial court found that as an assignee, the insurer was a shareholder, not a creditor, and thus not entitled to interest. The insurer appealed, and the court reversed and remanded. The court held that under the provisions of the Illinois Savings and Loan Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 32, para. 701 et seq. (1969), holders of withdrawable capital accounts or their assignees attained a hybrid status of shareholder-creditor upon default of the savings association. The account holders were deprived of the use of their funds and profits produced therefrom during the liquidation proceedings, and thus they were entitled as creditors to interest for its use. As creditors, the holders of withdrawable capital accounts or their assignees were entitled to interest at the statutory rate commencing from the date of default, which interest was to be provided only from liquidated surplus on a pro rata basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners brought an action for a declaratory judgment that the city, in the operation of a proposed landfill, was subject to county zoning ordinances, and for an injunction preventing the city from purchasing proposed property without first obtaining proper zoning from the county. The county intervened, and the trial court permanently enjoined the city and from building the landfill unless and until it complied with county and state zoning regulations. The city filed a petition to dissolve the injunction, and the trial court dissolved the injunction. An intermediate court affirmed. The landowners and county appealed, contending that the city was subject to zoning in its performance of a proprietary function and operation outside its corporate limits. On appeal, the court reversed, remanded, and held that the city's use of the proposed site as a landfill was not to be permitted upon issuance of a conditional use permit by the county and that the county's prohibition of the use by reason of its zoning ordinance contravened the clearly expressed legislative intent that such operations be conducted only upon issuance of a permit from the state's environmental protection agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In challenging his conviction for murder and his death sentence, defendant claimed that: the State had no basis to use peremptory challenges during voir dire; there was insufficient evidence for the verdict; his in-court identification was improper; the trial court erred in refusing to admit his alibi witness's prior statement; the prosecutor made improper remarks during trial; and the exclusion of death-qualified jurors was unconstitutional. In affirming the conviction, the court found that the State's peremptory challenges were authorized by statute, there was sufficient evidence for the verdict, and the in-court identification was proper. Regarding the latter, the court ruled that a lineup was not required. Rather, the jury was to judge the evidence and because its decision was not unreasonable, it would not be disturbed. The court found that the alibi witness's prior statement was correctly excluded because she had a motive to protect defendant when it was made. The prosecutor's remarks were improper but so minor that prejudice was unlikely. Because the U.S. Supreme Court had held Illinois' death penalty statute unconstitutional, the court vacated his sentence.</SPAN></P>

It was not error to inform the jury that defendant had been advised of his rights before he made an inculpatory statement. The trial court did err in admitting testimony that defendant's estranged wife had a broken jaw at the time of the murder of her alleged lover because it was not relevant and prejudicially implied that defendant was a &quot;wife beater.&quot; However, the error was harmless due to the overwhelming evidence of guilt.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the statute was not vague or uncertain and that the exclusion of municipalities with populations over 1,000,000 from the operation of statute did not constitute an unreasonable or arbitrary classification. The court found that under the statute, reporting was required and any copper dealer who knowingly failed to comply was guilty of a misdemeanor. Defendant failed to meet his burden to prove that the classification was unreasonable and arbitrary as he only offered proof that a purchaser of copper in Chicago was not obliged to file reports under the statute. The court concluded that the statute's inspection provisions, even if unenforceable without a search warrant, did not render the entire statute invalid; regardless, as defendant was not directly affected by those provisions, he had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute on that basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company was in the business of selling various products, including cigarettes, through vending machines. In a proceeding before the Department, the company sought credit for alleged overpayment of retailers' occupation taxes. The company contended that the portion of its sales receipts attributable to the collection of the cigarette use tax should not be included in its gross receipts for the purpose of calculating its retailers' occupation tax liability. The Department denied the company's claim, and the trial court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that cigarette use taxes were not to be included in the base upon the which the retailers' occupation tax was computed. The court determined that the cigarette use tax was a tax on the consumer, not the vendor, and that the vendor was merely acting as an agent for the state in the collection of the tax. The court thus found that the cigarette use taxes did not constitute &quot;consideration&quot; received by the company for the sale of cigarettes and, therefore, that the cigarette tax was not part of the company's &quot;gross receipts&quot; under the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Appellate Court for the Fifth District (Illinois) reversed the contempt judgment against defendant picketers entered by the trial court for violating a temporary restraining order obtained by plaintiff hospital after negations with its union were not successful before the contract expired. The hospital appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The picketing began shortly after the contract expired. The hospital obtained a temporary restraining order without notice to the picketers. The picketing continued and the hospital filed a petition for rule to show cause why the picketers should not have been found in contempt for failure to obey the restraining order. The circuit court found the picketers in contempt and assessed fines totaling $ 16,270. On the same day, in another case, the Supreme Court of Illinois ruled that a peaceful strike and picketing against a not-for-profit hospital was not against public policy and that hospitals were not exempt from the provisions of the Anti-Injunction Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 2a (1969). Reversing the appellate court, the court explained that in view of the allegations of the complaint and the law at the time in question, it believed that the circuit court was warranted in issuing the temporary restraining order without notice. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 69, para. 3--1 (1969). Therefore, its order finding the picketers in contempt of court was proper because the question of whether the order was erroneous was not before the circuit court; only jurisdiction was needed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision of the appellate court and affirmed the contempt judgment of the circuit court assessing fines against the picketers for refusing to obey the temporary restraining order obtained by the hospital.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff racehorse owners' associations sought review of a judgment from the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois), which reversed a decision that had held that an amended rule on jockey compensation was a &quot;nullity&quot; and had overturned an order from defendant Illinois Racing Board (board) that the rule was enforceable under the Horse Racing Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 8, paras. 37a through 37r (1971).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As an initial matter, the court noted that the Act admittedly granted the board extensive control over the manner in which horse races were conducted and over the qualification and eligibility of various participants. Nevertheless, the court then found that the power to establish the compensation of jockeys or other persons not employed by board was not demonstrated in the language of the Act, rejecting the assertion that such power existed upon the rationale that an increase in compensation might have an indirect benefit on horse racing. The court further found that the absence of such express authority, as well as the absence from the statute of any standards, criteria, or procedure for determining compensation, only confirmed the view that the legislature did not intend for such determinations to be made by board. Instead, the apparent legislative intention was that the matter of compensation for jockeys was to be left to the normal process of individual or collective bargaining. Thus, the court concluded that under the Act as it was drawn, board lacked the power to enter the order in question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizen complained that the Ethics Act was too broad and was an unjust encroachment upon the right of privacy because it required certain disclosures and it delegated to the Secretary of State the power to render advisory opinions. Among the reasons stated by the trial court for finding the Ethics Act unconstitutional was the fact that it provided a sanction for its violation, and thereby purported to specify a penalty in addition to that provided by the constitution. The court reversed. One purpose of the Ethics Act was to disclose any abuse of office and to instill in the public trust and confidence in its government and officials. The Ethics Act reflected the compelling governmental interest which was paramount to the rights of the individual, and the statute was not overbroad as an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. The penalty which the Ethics Act provided was for willfully filing a false or incomplete statement. The statute was constitutional except insofar as it purported to authorize the Secretary of State to render advisory opinions, and such invalidity did not affect the other provisions of the Ethics Act which could be given effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The putative father's petition alleged that he was the father of the child and that the adoption agency knew that fact but, notwithstanding such knowledge, the adoption was finalized without notice to him or his consent because certain provisions of the Illinois Adoption Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 4, paras. 9.1-1E, 9.-8 (1969), precluded the father of an illegitimate child from asserting any right to the child in such proceedings. The putative father contended that the statutory provisions were unconstitutional. The trial court denied his petition, holding that Illinois law validly allowed an adoption without notice or consent of the putative father. On appeal, the putative father contended that the provisions of the Illinois Adoption Act, as well as &sect; 12 of the Illinois Paternity Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 106 3/4, para. 62 (1969), which denied him custody of his child absent an attempt to legally adopt the child, were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court agreed, holding that the laws, which denied a hearing to determine the fitness of the father for the custody of his child born out of wedlock while extended such right to the mother, violated equal-protection principles.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the potential loss of pension benefits did not violate due process because the rights to those benefits were not vested and there was no proof that the employees would lose those benefits if they were discharged.

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 500.23-1 (1971)) of the Revenue Act of 1939, was unconstitutional as applied to assessments made in 1971.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee taxpayer, alleging that he represented all taxpayers under the age of 65, challenged &sect; 19.23-1 of the Revenue Act of 1939 because it granted a homestead exemption to persons 65 years of age and older. Although &sect; 19.23-1 specifically provided that it was applicable to taxes assessed in 1971, the circuit court found that it was unconstitutional as applied to those assessments. On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court's judgment. The court held that the homestead exemption was not valid under Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 6 (1870), and the 1870 Constitution was still in force and effect through June 30, 1971. The court held that the general assembly could not apply Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 6 (1970) retroactively. Because the homestead exemption of &sect; 19.23-1 could not be applied to the first part of 1971, and real estate was assessed in Illinois on January 1 of each year, the homestead exemption was not applicable for any portion of 1971. However, the homestead exemption was valid for property assessed in 1972 and subsequent years and the classification of individuals on the basis of under and over 65 years of age was rational and reasonable.</SPAN></P>

During the chase, the officer's car went off the road and the injured party suffered severe injuries. The injured party sought compensation pursuant to Ill. Rev.

The court affirmed, finding that the general assembly had intended that absolute liability be imposed. The court also ruled that the city had no standing to attack the statute as violative of due process because a municipal corporation had no privileges or immunities under the federal constitution which it could invoke in opposition to the will of its creator.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated appeal, plaintiffs, cigarette retailers and cigarette purchasers, sought review of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which held that the cigarette tax ordinance enacted under the &quot;home rule&quot; authority was constitutional except &sect; 178.1-4(b) of the ordinance. That section was found unconstitutional because it violated equal-protection assurances. Defendant city collector cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The cigarette purchasers argued that Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(e) excepted the power to impose any privilege or non-property taxes from the general grant of authority given home rule units under Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(a). They further argued that if the restrictions of Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(e) were limited to taxes on income, earnings, or occupation, it violated the due process and equal-protection provisions of the United States and Illinois constitutions. The court found that the limitations found in &sect; 6(e) were not arbitrary or unreasonable and there was nothing to suggest a non-uniform application.The cigarette retailers argued that the tax imposed by the ordinance was an occupation tax and therefore beyond the powers of the city &sect; 6(e). In addition, they argued that the ordinance was so ambiguous, vague, indefinite, and uncertain, that it violated the due-process clause of the United States and Illinois constitutions. The court found that the ambiguities were surface or superficial ambiguities and that it was clear that the intention was to create a use tax. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the ordinance placed a burden upon interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

The injured party challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 2-202 of the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, Ill. Rev.

Stat. ch. 24, paras. 1-4-5, 1-4-6 (1969). The court held that immunity was granted to a police officer only if he was in the execution or enforcement of any law and not merely when he was engaged in the performance of his duties as a police officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After article XXXV, relating to procedures, insurance, and damages for certain automobile accident victims, was added to the Illinois Insurance Code, the citizen sought to enjoin the officials from expending funds appropriated for the enforcement of the new article. The lower court issued an injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the statute violated Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, which prohibited the passage of any special law where a general law could be made applicable. That persons were injured by different types of vehicles did not justify different legislative treatment in the determination of the amount to be recovered. Further, the court found the provision for arbitration violated Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9 because original jurisdiction of all justiciable matters was in the circuit court, whereas the new provision allowed entry of judgment upon the arbitrator's award. Finally, the requirement that the losing litigant pay the fees of the arbitrator violated Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14, which prohibited fee officers in the judicial system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers alleged that the director sought to restrict the August 1, 1969 valuation limitation to capital assets and requested that, if the Illinois Income Tax Act (Act), Ill.

(1969), was construed so as to impose a tax upon accumulation of or the appreciation in value of property occurring before August 1, 1969, the Act, in that respect, be held unconstitutional. The trial court held that the valuation date applied to the taxpayers' assets, which included a farm, commercial real estate, and profit sharing plans. The court affirmed, declining to overrule its previous decision that found a legislative intent to establish an August 1, 1969 valuation limitation.

A law was general even if it operated in a single place where conditions necessary to its operation existed. The statute was not local or special merely because of a legislative classification based on population or territorial differences.

Defendants, who were minors when the offense was committed, were tried as adults after a juvenile court judge entered no objection to the state attorney's petitions to remove them from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, pursuant to &sect; 2--7(3) of the Juvenile Court Act (Act), Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charges arose from an incident where the victim died a few days after being severely beaten by defendants and others. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court held that defendants' removal from juvenile court was constitutional because: 1) the Act did not require the juvenile court to hold a full investigation as to whether jurisdiction should be waived, and 2) the Act's grant of discretion to the state's attorney was not constitutionally objectionable because it could be presumed that the state would take the purposes of the Act into consideration when making a determination. The court found that: 1) a mistrial in their first prosecution did not require the granting of defendants' petition for discharge on the grounds of double jeopardy because the mistrial was not the result of the state's improper conduct; 2) defendants' request for a manslaughter instruction was properly denied because that instruction did not have to be given when the evidence clearly demonstrated that the crime was murder and there was no evidence to support a conviction of manslaughter; and 3) there was sufficient testimony to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minor, by her father and next friend, sought damages for injuries she suffered on the park district's merry-go-round. The trial court dismissed counts I and III, and the minor appealed. Count I alleged ordinary negligence on the part of the park district, the existence of public liability insurance, and the waiver of immunity for damages from ordinary negligence to the extent of the coverage. Count III was a direct action against the insurer. The trial court found that the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para. 3 -- 106 (1969), granted immunity to the park district and its employees for ordinary negligence and that the immunity was not waived to the extent of liability coverage as provided in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para. 9 -- 103(b) (1969). On appeal, the court found that both statutory sections were constitutional. Therefore, the court held that the trial court erred in finding &sect; 9 -- 103(b) unconstitutional. The immunity to liability for the negligence of the park district or its employees granted by &sect; 3 -- 106 was waived. The judgment was reversed as to count I and affirmed as to count III, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 440 et seq. (1961). The taxpayer was a maker and seller of custom-tailored apparel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer argued that he was not subject to taxation under the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act because the Act applied to the sale of custom-made garments only if the seller also engaged in the sale of stock clothing. The court disagreed and held that custom-made suits served substantially the same function as those purchased from stock. The court rejected the taxpayer's contention that he was a serviceman and not a retailer and was exempt by a rule of the Department. The court pointed out that Department rules had since been amended to state that persons who engaged in the business of selling clothing for use or consumption and not for resale incurred retailers' tax liability whether such clothing was sold as a stock item or whether it was produced on special order for the purchaser. Finally, the court held that the Act was not unconstitutional because the use of the word &quot;substantially&quot; was not too vague and too indefinite a delegation of legislative authority. The court found that the application of the tax was justified by testimony at the administrative hearing that the taxpayer sold custom-made garments that served substantially the same function as stock items of apparel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff board of education, individually and on behalf of all local taxing bodies, brought a class action against defendant county treasurer seeking an order for a refund of the &quot;excess&quot; fees being held by the treasurer on the grounds that the pertinent provisions of the Fees and Salaries Act were unconstitutional. The Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) granted the treasurer's motion for summary judgment and the board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The treasurer collected the taxes levied by the various taxing bodies in the county. Pursuant to &sect; 21 of the Fees and Salaries Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 53, para. 39 (1969), he deducted a fee before distributing the balance to the respective taxing units. During the five-year period, his aggregate fees exceeded the expenses of operation of his office by more than $ 11 million. This excess amount was paid into the county treasury as required by law. The board alleged that the fees should be returned proportionately to the various taxing bodies because they were unreasonable within the meaning of Ill. Const. art. X, &sect; 12 (1870), and therefore in violation of the &quot;needful revenue&quot; and &quot;corporate purpose&quot; provisions of Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 1 and 10 (1870). The court held that the constitutional validity of the allegedly excess fees could not be determined on the basis of their effect in a single county during a limited period of time. While large excess fees may have resulted in one county during a certain year or period of years, it was conceivable that fees collected in other counties of the same class during the same time may have produced little or no excess at all.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court dismissing the board's complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A collision occurred between plaintiff victim and an automobile owned by defendant city. Defendants argued that plaintiffs failed to allege that notices were given as required by &sect; 8-102 of the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, Ill. Rev.

Plaintiffs also argued that defendant city waived the defense of failure to give notice when it contracted for insurance. The court reversed the dismissal, holding that plaintiffs were not required to allege the giving of notice. Sections 8-102, 8-103 were reasonably connected to the general subject of the tort immunity of local public entities, and the notice requirement did not deprive plaintiffs of equal protection. The allegation of actual notice did not satisfy the requirement. However, because the defense of failure to comply with &sect; 8-102 existed solely by statute and was not excepted in &sect; 9-103(b) of the Act, the defense of failure to give notice was waived.</SPAN></P>

A chain was placed around the middle of the sculpture and was locked into place. The State's Attorney advised defendant's attorney to remove the exhibit from the show. Defendant then had the exhibit removed from the main gallery to a separate room where it could be seen on request only. Thereafter, a deputy sheriff seized the exhibit.

The court held that although it was desirable that an affidavit charging a crime in an extradition proceeding recite sufficient facts to show probable cause, the scope of inquiry to test the validity of a rendition warrant was limited to three questions: (1) was defendant substantially charged with a crime under the laws of the demanding State; (2) was the person in custody the person charged; (3) was he a fugitive from justice. The court held that even though the complaints, standing alone, did not show probable cause, they were affidavits made as required by &sect; 3 of the Act and 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3182, and they were therefore sufficient to support the rendition warrant.</SPAN></P>

At the request of the state welfare department director, the governor transferred funds from a program that did not qualify for federal funding to another that did. The county, which administered the program from which funds were taken, brought an action in the circuit court, which issued a restraining order and injunction requiring the restoration of the funding. The governor and director petitioned for leave to seek a writ of mandamus ordering the county welfare director to return state funds paid under the circuit court's order. The court affirmed the circuit court's orders and denied the governor and director's petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenants challenged decisions under the Illinois Forcible Entry and Detainer Act (Act), to award possession of the rented premises to plaintiffs. The owners contended that the appeals had to be dismissed because the tenants failed to file appeal bonds within 5 days as required by section 18 of the Illinois Forcible Entry and Detainer Act. The court held that the requirement of a bond as prerequisite to an appeal was violated the Fourteenth Amendment, Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 2 (1870), Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7 (1870), Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1970), and Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6 (1970). The owners also contended that the forcible detainer action was for possession and that no equitable defenses could be recognized. The court held that the tenants sufficiently pleaded the existence and breach of the implied warranties of habitability. Thus, the court reversed the judgments of the lower court and remanded the cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was 16 years old at the time the offense of which he was convicted was committed.

On appeal, the court noted that the judge presiding in the juvenile division did not object to the removal of the action. The matter was not referred to the chief judge of the circuit court for decision and disposition as provided for in the statute. Defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 2-7(3) of the Act.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing child witnesses to testify after finding they were competent. It was not an abuse of discretion to refuse to call a witness as the court's witness until some hostility to the defendants became apparent because defendants were given the opportunity to cross-examine the witness and there was no showing of prejudice by reason of the refusal to make her the court's witness at any earlier point in her testimony. Section 11 -- 9 of the Illinois Public Aid Code, Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury convicted defendant of endangering the life or health of a child, his three-year old stepdaughter. On appeal, defendant argued that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 2354 (1969) was so vague and uncertain that his prosecution and conviction deprived him of due process in violation of Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 2 and the Fourteenth Amendment. The court determined that the statute clearly referred to children under 14 years of age, that the use of the words &quot;health&quot; and &quot;injure&quot; in the statute proscribed the inflicting of personal injury upon a child, and that whether the statute applied under hypothetical situations posed by defendant but which did not involve defendant could not be considered by the court on the issue of the statute's constitutional validity. The court held that the statute was not so vague as to constitute an unconstitutional deprivation of due process of law as to defendant. The court reversed defendant's conviction because hearsay testimony of defendant's wife's sister as to statements made by the wife tending to prove defendant's guilt was improperly admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The indictees challenged their indictment on charges of obstruction of justice, alleging prosecutorial misconduct in front of the grand jury.

The special prosecutor filed a petition for a writs of mandamus and prohibition commanding the judge to expunge its order and restraining the judge from taking any further action in relation to the indictment. Upon consideration, the court awarded the writs. The court found that neither Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 112-b (1965) nor Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 412 authorized the use of grand jurors' testimony to attack the validity of an indictment. The court rejected the contention that the indictment should have been dismissed because it was prepared before the grand jury actually voted, noting that &sect; 17 of the Jurors Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 78, para. 17 (1969), clearly contemplated that the grand jury vote upon the actual bill of indictment. The court rejected the indictees' contention that the indictment should have been dismissed because of extensive adverse publicity, holding that an indictment was not assailable upon the ground of the possible prejudicial effects of pretrial media coverage.</SPAN></P>

The attorney defended on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional. The court suspended the attorney, finding that the Bar had the authority to act as commissioners of the court in disbarment proceedings. The court also held that the attorney exhibited a continuous course of conduct of the type which warranted disbarment. His demeanor before the commissioners was of a quarrelsome and abusive nature.; he interrupted the hearings by continuous and repetitive challenges of the right of the commissioners to proceed against him, incessant demands that they cease and desist, and successive threats to sue the commissioners and persons involved in the proceeding. After the proceedings, the attorney carried out his threats and sued the commissioners.

Defendant did not make any motions to quash the complaint, and at trial, defendant's attorney stated in his opening statement that the Act was unconstitutional. Defendant was convicted and did not file any post-trial motions. Defendant appealed, claiming that the Act denied him due process and equal protection of the law and that the Act was an improper exercise of the police power. In dismissed the appeal, the court held that defendant failed to properly preserve the issue of the constitutionality of the statute by not filing pre-trial or post-trial motions or by further developing the issue at trial. The charge in defense counsel's opening statement that the Act was totally unconstitutional was inadequate as a foundation for appeal.</SPAN></P>

He argued that pretrial publicity denied him a fair trial and that the felony statute with which he was charged deprived him of equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that although he was convicted of a felony under &sect; 11--4 of the Criminal Code, one committing the same acts under the same circumstances could be convicted of a misdemeanor under &sect; 11--5. Thus, he was deprived of equal protection of the law. Defendant, 54 years of age, allegedly masturbated a 12-year-old boy. On appeal, the court found that the legislative intent of &sect; 11--5 of the Criminal Code, a misdemeanor, was to discourage ventures into sexual experiences with children under 18. Section 11--4 of the Criminal Code, a felony, was intended to prevent the knowing and deliberate victimization of immature children under 16. The court did not find the classifications so arbitrary or unreasonable as to constitute discrimination. Thus, the court held that defendant was not denied equal protection of the law when he was charged under &sect; 11--4. However, the court reversed and remanded the cause because two jurors had read a prejudicial article regarding defendant before trial. Under the circumstances, the court held that defendant did not receive a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was found guilty, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the presumption set forth in &sect; 24-1(c) that the presence of a weapon in an automobile was prima facie evidence that the weapon was in defendant's possession was valid because the officer's testimony and the record supported a finding that defendant was the driver of the vehicle and, thus, was in control of the vehicle. Further, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the shotgun as evidence because the officer had a right to inquire about the license plate and the expired safety sticker, and the shotgun was plainly visible from where the officer stood.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from an order from the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), which convicted him of the unlawful sale of marijuana in violation of the Criminal Code of Illinois, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 22 -- 3 (1969) and, pursuant to the mandatory minimum penalties for the unlawful sale of a narcotic drug found in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 22 -- 40 (1969), sentenced him to prison for a minimum of 10 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One of defendant's contentions in the appeal of his conviction was that the classification of marijuana in the Narcotic Drug Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 22 -- 1 et seq. (1969), with mandatory minimum statutory penalties for a first conviction, deprived him of due process and equal protection of the law in violation of the Illinois and the United States Constitutions. On appeal, the court reversed because it found there was no rational basis for the statutory classification of marijuana under the Narcotic Drug Act rather than the Drug Abuse Control Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 801 et seq. (1969). The absence of a rational basis for distinguishing first convictions for sales of marijuana from first convictions for sales of drugs placed in the Drug Abuse Control Act compelled the conclusion that the present classification of marijuana offended the equal-protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The court noted that the recent legislative removal of marijuana from the Narcotic Drug Act and reclassification under the Cannabis Control Act, H.B. 788, P.A. 77 -- 758, approved August 16, 1971, was not inconsistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the defendant's conviction on the basis that the classification of marijuana under which defendant was convicted was constitutionally impermissible. Because of that holding, it was not necessary for the court to consider the other contentions advanced by defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent's contention was that the validity of the Transportation Bond Act (Act) must be determined by the Constitution of 1870 in effect at the time the Act was passed by the General Assembly and not by the Constitution of 1970 in effect at the time the Act became law. The underlying issue was whether the legislature had power to enact legislation to anticipate and be tested by an already ratified but not yet effective constitution even though the legislation possibly may not have been valid if tested by the constitution in effect at the time of its passage. The court awarded the writ of mandamus, finding the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld legislation in anticipation of a constitutional amendment as have most state courts. The authority to the contrary involved distinguishable circumstances where there was pre-ratification anticipatory legislation. The Act set forth with sufficient definiteness the specific purposes as required by the Illinois Constitution and did not authorize an expenditure of public funds for nonpublic purposes in contravention of the Constitution. The court further disagreed that the Act contained more than one subject in violation of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver lost control of his car and struck a tree, injuring a passenger. The passenger brought a negligence action against the driver.

The court held that: (1) guest statutes were enacted to protect those who gratuitously extended the hospitality of their motor vehicles to passengers; (2) the question of classification was for the legislature, and the courts did not interfere unless the classification was clearly unreasonable; (3) the statute did not preclude recovery but required a stricter degree of fault; and (4) the statute was a reasonable exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">All three complaints were dismissed holding that the sale of obscenity was protected under the First Amendment. Defendant's counsel denied that the trial court ruled the ordinance in question unconstitutional, and asserted that the orders of dismissal appealed from were not final and appealable. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that while the orders did not specifically find the ordinance unconstitutional, nevertheless, the intent and meaning of the findings could be construed in no other way, and they were final and appealable. The defendant also contended finally that he was not adequately apprised of the charges against him because the offending books were not attached to the complaints and therefore, he could not prepare a defense. The court held that the complaints filed by the City against defendant properly stated a cause of action for the violation of the City's obscenity ordinance; and that the court erred in dismissing the three complaints. The court held further that the City's ordinance incorporated established obscenity standards, and therefore the ordinance definition was constitutionally sufficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defeated candidate requested a limited &quot;discovery recount&quot; of 25 percent of the precincts. Finding irregularities in the ballots, he then filed the action for a recount of all precincts. The circuit court dismissed the case because the defeated candidate did not provide the cost of the recount. On appeal from that judgment, the court noted that an earlier version of Election Code &sect; 23-23 contained a provision permitting courts to charge election recount costs to petitioners who requested the recounts. That language was eliminated from the Code when the legislature revamped the state's statutes to make them compatible with changes in the court system. The court concluded that the substantive amendments to &sect; 23-23 were inadvertent and that the legislature intended to retain the language permitting the court to assess costs of election recounts to the requesting party. Even though the paragraph was eliminated, the court read the relevant language into &sect; 23-23 and held that the circuit court was authorized to tax the recount costs to the defeated candidate. The court also ruled that the section was not unconstitutional on its face or as applied. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

As a threshold issue, the court held that the retailer was actually a producer-retailer and therefore the federal tax was chargeable under 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 6420(a). The court affirmed the department's interpretation of the statute, reasoning that the language of the statute was clear that the incidence of the tax was on the producer-retailer and therefore the gross receipts were taxable. The court went on to reason that while there had been some ambiguity in the past surrounding the application of the tax, an amendment of the interpretation of the regulation that applied the tax to gross receipts was a proper construction of a statute that may have been erroneously construed previously and applied the rule that weight must be given to the agency charged with interpreting a regulation, even if the prior interpretation was erroneous and the agency changed the interpretation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The distributor sought to recover sums of money paid under protest. When it declared bankruptcy, the trustee intervened in the case. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted by the trial court. The trustee appealed, arguing that certain amendments to the Act violated the uniformity provision of Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1 and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The court found that the tax was no longer an occupation tax imposed upon distributors, but was an occupation tax imposed upon those doing business as retailers of cigarettes, because the statute specifically required that the distributor pass the tax on to the retailer. The trustee also argued that the graduated discount had the same effect as a graduated tax on the distributors. The court found that it was apparent that the legislature made a determination that the cost of collecting the taxes decreased as the volume of sales increased. The court found nothing in the allegations of the distributor's amended complaint that overcame the presumption of the validity of the classification for discount purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant director of the Department of Local Government Affairs of the State (director) appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted relief to plaintiff corporations in their action concerning the construction and validity of Article IX-A to the Illinois Constitution of 1870. The court consolidated the case with two other actions before the court concerning the same issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation filed a class action against the director and several county officials challenging the addition of article IX-A to the state constitution. The action was followed by two more filings concerning the same issue; one, an original proceeding in the court filed by a class of natural persons, the other, a complaint for declaratory judgment filed by a class of natural persons, sole proprietors and partnerships. In each of the second two filings, the plaintiffs asserted that the corporation did not represent them adequately and did not effectively present all legal challenges to article IX-A. On consolidated review, the court held that the discrimination produced by article IX-A violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court found that article IX-A classified personal property on a basis that did not depend upon any of the characteristics of the property that was taxed, or upon the use to which it was put, but solely upon the ownership of the property. The court noted that the state's classification did not rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court granting relief to the corporations and remanded the cause to that court with directions to dismiss the complaint. The court dismissed the complaint filed by the natural persons. The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court which dismissed the complaint with respect to all plaintiffs except one, reversed in part and remanded with directions to dismiss the remaining complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers and defendant townships challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which held that the excess commissions that the township obtained pursuant to &sect; 36.6 of the Fees and Salaries Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 53, para. 55.6 (1967), that were retained on or after the original decree's date, be deposited with the county and that no ruling was needed on the validity of any commission that the county charged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the taxpayers' action against the townships, it was alleged that the tax system was unevenly administered. The circuit court ordered that excess commissions retained by the townships on or after the date on which &sect; 36.6 of the Fees and Salaries Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 53, para. 55.6 (1967), was declared to be unconstitutional be deposited with the county. The circuit court enjoined the townships from collecting the tax and ordered that the validity of any commission did not have to be adjudicated. The court affirmed the setting of the date of the decree of unconstitutionality as of the effective date of the order on appeal, reversed the ruling that the validity of the county's commission was a nonissue, and remanded for a ruling as to the commission's legality. The circuit court's order reasonably refrained from imposing a burden that predated the decree of unconstitutionality and prevented the townships from keeping the funds that they unconstitutionally held on said date. The court held that a remand was needed because the issue of if the statutory commissions were illegally confiscatory insofar as they bore no relationship to the services that were rendered was unresolved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed a portion of the judgment in the taxpayers' challenge to the tax system. The court held that the townships were required to return the commissions that they held on the date that the provision, which allowed for those commissions, was declared unconstitutional. The court also reversed the decision to not adjudicate the validity of the county's commission and remanded the action for a ruling on the commission's validity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff mother appealed the decisions of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed her paternity action against defendant father, denied her motions to vacate two different orders, and denied leave to amend her complaint to conform to the evidence. The mother argued that her motion for leave to file an amended complaint had extended the time for filing her notice of appeal under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 303(a), 43 Ill. 2d R. 303(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On March 31, a circuit court granted a father's motion to dismiss a paternity action. On April 21, the mother filed a motion to vacate the order of dismissal, which was denied on April 24. On May 18, the mother requested leave to file an amended complaint but did not file a notice of appeal. The circuit court granted leave to brief the amendment issue. On June 1, the mother filed the brief on amendment and again sought to vacate the March 31 order. On July 2, the circuit court denied the motions to amend and to vacate the March 31 order. The mother appealed the orders of March, April, and July. The court examined the two applicable rules: Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 68.3 (1969), which allowed parties to attempt to vacate a judgment within 30 days of a bench trial; and Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 303(a), which required parties to file a notice of appeal within 30 days of a final judgment. 43 Ill. 2d R. 303(a). The court dismissed appeal of the March and the April orders because the mother had not filed a notice of appeal within 30 days. Her motion for leave to amend was not a motion to vacate those orders, which would have extended the time for appeal. The court affirmed the July 2 order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that it could not review either the circuit court's March 31 dismissal or the April 24 denial of the mother's motion to vacate the order of dismissal. Those appeals were dismissed. The court affirmed the circuit court's denial of the mother's motion to amend her complaint and denial of her motion to vacate the July 2 order of dismissal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After his wife was shot to death in a robbery at her place of work, the husband filed for death benefits under the Act. The arbitrator denied the death claim, because the husband was not totally dependent upon his wife's earnings as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138.7b (1967). The Commission affirmed the arbitrator's action. The trial court found that the requirement that a &quot;husband&quot; prove he was totally dependent upon his wife's earnings involved an unconstitutional classification based upon sex, and remanded with directions to award the husband benefits under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138.7(a) (1967), as if he were a widow. The Commission entered the award, and the trial court affirmed. On appeal by the employer, the court reversed. The court noted that the legislature was generally allowed to make classifications based upon sex so long as the classification was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The court could not conclude that there was no fair reason for the distinction, especially when the distinction was viewed as part of the comprehensive Act.</SPAN></P>

The conviction was affirmed on direct appeal and defendant did not appeal further.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued first that he was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the court-appointed counsel on appeal was incompetent for his failure to raise that issue in the appellate court. The state argued that the issue of reasonable doubt was not a constitutional question within the scope of the Post-Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA) and that res judicata and waiver barred it as a result of the appeal. As for the competency of defendant's counsel on appeal, the state contended that it was not an issue that arose in the proceeding that resulted in his conviction, and therefore the issue was not available under the PCHA. The court held that defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal was reviewable in a habeas corpus proceeding as waiver of the issue of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt would have acted as a denial of due process if counsel had truly been ineffective. However, on review, the court held that it did not believe the issue was so patently meritorious that the failure of appellate counsel to raise the issue on direct appeal constituted incompetence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had been adjudged to be a minor in need of supervision, and she was placed on probation. A delinquency petition was filed, and it was alleged that defendant had violated her probation. After finding defendant to be a delinquent minor, the circuit court revoked her probation and committed her to the custody of the department. Defendant was placed on parole, but she ran away from home and was returned to the custody of the department. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, finding that defendant was not subject to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment and that defendant was not classified so as to deprive her of equal protection of the laws. The court found that defendant's commitment subsequent to the violation of a lawful court order was not unconstitutional and noted that defendant had ample recourse to obtain her release. The court stated that defendant's records would be kept confidential pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, paras. 702-8, 702-9, 702-10 (1969). The court determined that defendant's classification was reasonable and was based upon a valid legislative purpose, i.e., the rehabilitation of juveniles.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 500.24 (Supp. 1970), which allowed a homestead exemption of real property owned and occupied by persons 65 years old, violated Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 1 and 3. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted summary judgment for plaintiffs, and the county officers sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The homestead exemption provided a reduction from the assessed value of real property occupied as a residence by a person 65 years of age or older who paid the property's real estate taxes and was an owner of record of the property. The court held that the trial court properly found that the exemption was not authorized by the homestead and exemption provisions of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 32 and was prohibited by Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 1 and 3. The homestead exemption did not fall within Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 3, which permitted the legislature to exempt property used exclusively for charitable purposes, because homeowners 65 years of age or older were not charitable organizations nor was the use of their property for private living quarters a charitable use. Further, the homestead and exemption referred to in Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 32, which provided that the general assembly was to pass liberal homestead and exemption laws, had always been related to freedom from execution sales to enforce creditor judgments, and neither exemptions had ever been available in the case of judgments for nonpayment of taxes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The banks brought an action against the director, defendant state treasurer, the state attorney general and various vendors and lessors of tangible personal property. The action alleged that the banks were required to pay state use and occupation taxes by reason of unauthorized, illegal and unconstitutional rules and collection procedures. The lower court granted the director's motion to strike and dismiss the complaints. Upon appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the legal incidence for the Illinois Retailer's Occupation Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, &sect; 440 et seq. was placed in sellers such as the banks and not buyers. Therefore, the statute did not violate &sect; 548 of Title 12 on Banks and Banking, 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 548. The court found that the use and occupation tax statutes do not provide for the taxation of national banks and the rules of the revenue department made it clear that the banks were not subject to the taxes imposed by those acts for their purchase and use of tangible personal property. The court failed to perceive any price discrimination in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act under 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 13 as the banks charged.</SPAN></P>

The minor child alleged that the city was negligent in its failure to enforce Chicago, Ill., &sect; 78 - 17(d) that empowered the city to compel the removal of materials containing a high level of lead when found on inspection. The trial court dismissed the action on the ground that the city was immune from lawsuit pursuant to the Local Governmental and Government Employees Tort Immunity Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, paras. 2-103,2-105 (1965). The minor child sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. However, the court based its affirmance on the ground that Chicago, Ill., Housing Code &sect; 78 - 17(d) had not been adopted until two years after the injuries alleged by the minor child. The court held that the cause of action against the city also failed under &sect; 78 -20. The court determined that if the minor child had a valid cause of action, it should be asserted against the party who violated &sect; 78 - 20, since the injuries occurred on private property.</SPAN></P>

The evidence seized should have been suppressed, but the testimony in response to the officers' actions was admissible on remand. The self-defense argument was rejected because defendants did not raise the issue at trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In this consolidated appeal, plaintiffs, teachers' union and individual teachers, challenged the summary judgment entered in the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois) in favor of defendant employer in their action seeking a declaration ordering the employer to offer individual teachers employment. Teacher's union contended that summary judgment was erroneously granted because there were unresolved and significant material issues of fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that summary judgment was properly granted. The facts set forth in the employer's affidavit clearly established its right to not retain individual teachers for another term following the expiration of their probationary term. The teacher's union's failure to file any responsive pleadings, or any counter-affidavit, constituted admissions of the facts contained in the employer's affidavit. The bare contention that individual teachers were not re-employed because of their union activity and their expressions of personal views on public education was insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact. The objections to the competency of the employer's affiant were not raised in the trial court and were not well taken. The affiant was apparently competent to testify to the matters presented. The contention that the employer had a duty, under its faculty constitution, to provide individual teachers with a specific statement of reasons for their non-retention was rejected. It was clearly refuted by the affidavit. Further, the allegations in the complaint on this matter were nothing more than statements of conclusions and did not present a genuine issue of fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment granting summary judgment to the employer.</SPAN></P>

The cases of two defendants convicted of heroin possession and defendant convicted of marijuana possession were consolidated by the court because there was a similarity of facts and similar application of a pertinent legal principle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant accused of marijuana possession claimed that the trench coat which contained marijuana was not his. The police searched the premises where he was located one day after a warrant was issued, they did not inventory the coat, and they were unable to account for its whereabouts at the time of the trial. All defendants claimed that allegations of the complaints for search warrants were false and that search warrants issued based upon affidavits that were signed with false or fictitious names. All defendants were convicted by lower courts of the drug possession charges with which they were charged, marijuana possession, and heroin possession, respectively. The court held that there was no constitutional or statutory right to controvert the matters declared under oath which occasioned the finding of probable cause and the issuance of a search warrant by a judicial officer. The court ruled that filing and docketing a search warrant after it was served and after an arrest was made comported with the requirements of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 108-4 (1969) and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 48, para. 2a (1967), no restraining order or injunction was to be granted by any court of Illinois, in any case involving or growing out of a dispute concerning terms or conditions of employment. Accordingly, the preliminary injunction was erroneously issued. Nevertheless, that injunction, while in force could not be disregarded. The injunction had to be obeyed, however erroneous the action of the trial court was, until it was reversed for error by orderly review. Disobedience of such an injunction was contempt of the lawful authority of the trial court and punishable as such. The court affirmed the sentences imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants alleged that plaintiff failed to comply with the six-month notice requirement of the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act found in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, paras. 8-102, 8-103 (1967). Plaintiff alleged that the notice requirement violated the Illinois constitution, which barred any differentiation in notice requirements between tort claims against private citizens and those against governmental entities. The notice requirements were applied equally to all those in the same class of local governmental entities and their employees. The principal purpose of such statutes was to give the public entity timely notice of the nature of claims against it so that it could investigate and settle those of merit without litigation. Public agencies, generally speaking, afforded a proper subject for legislative classification. The court held that paras. 8-102, 8-103 in no way violated the provisions of the Illinois constitution prohibiting special laws and special privileges and immunities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the lower court and held that the withholding of tax from compensation paid to the employees was valid. The court noted that if, in the interest of general welfare, the police power could be exercised to protect citizens and their businesses in financial and economic matters, it could be exercised to protect the government itself against potential financial loss and the possible disruption of governmental functions. The court found that the legislature could have appropriately invoked the power as a complement to the power to tax. The court found that this reflected a purpose of the legislature to create a tax base by which the burden of the cost of government would be proportionately shared by a greater number of its citizens and businesses. Finally, the court pointed out that the fact that police laws and regulations prevented the enjoyment of certain individual rights in property without providing compensation thereto did not necessarily render them unconstitutional as violating the due process clause or as appropriating private property for public use without compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought a reversal on the basis that the order was violative of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The court reversed. Section 19(f)(1) of the Illinois Workmen's Compensation Act provided that in cases of claims against the State, the decision of the Commission was not subject to judicial review. The court held that neither the common-law writ of certiorari nor the statutory writ of certiorari was available to employees of the State to review a final decision of the Commission. The doctrine of sovereign immunity was applicable to bar judicial review. As to whether &sect; 19(f)(1) created an invidious discrimination against State employees, the court held that it did not. While the legislature had no power to discriminate as to persons of the same class, it had the power to make reasonable classifications. A legislative distinction was not arbitrary if any state of facts could reasonably be conceived that sustained it. The court held that &sect; 19(f)(1) did not violate the constitution as a delegation of legislative or judicial power to the Commission nor did it discriminate against State employees.</SPAN></P>

When the debtors defaulted on the notes, the trial court entered judgment upon the warrant of attorney against the debtors, and denied their motion to vacate. The debtors filed another motion to arrest the judgment alleging that the judgment by confession constituted a deprivation of due process of law and deprived them of their constitutional right to trial. The motion was denied, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that constitutional rights could be waived if done intelligently and knowingly, and included a waiver of notice in advance. The court found no constitutional objection to confession of judgment per se and that the parties at issue were knowledgeable businessmen negotiating an ordinary business loan from a bank, and nothing in the record indicated that they did not knowingly and intelligently waive notice and agree to entry of judgment against them as security for the loan they sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parent was a resident of school district No. 109 and had four children attending schools in the district. The parent was asked by the school to pay a textbook rental fee for each of his children attending school, and the parent failed to pay the textbook rental or make a confidential arrangement with the treasurer. The textbooks were taken from the children, and the parent then instituted this action against the school board seeking a declaratory judgment that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, paras. 10--20.13, 10--22.25 and 34--8 (1969) were unconstitutional under numerous provisions of both the United States and Illinois constitutions. The parent primarily argued that charging pupils for the use of textbooks violated Ill. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the parent appealed. The court affirmed, holding that Ill. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 did not prohibit the legislature from authorizing school boards to purchase textbooks and rent them to pupils, because the meaning of the term &quot;free schools&quot; at the time the constitution was adopted and ratified by the voters did not include furnishing textbooks to the students at public expense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On behalf of itself and others similarly situated, appellant filed a complaint against the director, arguing that a service tax was void. In 1967, two amendments to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 8-11-5 (1967) were passed at the same session. The amendments substantially altered the taxing scheme under the Service Occupation Tax Act. Appellant contended that the legislative act of adopting the second amendment repealed the first. Appellant argued that where two amendments to the same statute were passed at the same session of the legislature, and were inconsistent, the latter in point of time controlled. The court affirmed the trial court and found that the second amendment was declared unconstitutional. It was void ab initio. It was at that point wholly inoperative as though it had never been passed, and therefore could not repeal the first amendment. When a statute was declared void, its repealing effect was also void. Thus, a bulletin of the director stating that the first amendment was in effect was correct. The court further held that the legislature could classify cities and counties according to population provided they were uniform for each class.</SPAN></P>

After she ran away from a foster home, a petition were filed alleging that the minor violated the terms of the order placing her on probation. The court below adjudged the minor a delinquent and she was committed to the custody of the Illinois Youth Commission (commission). On appeal, the court affirmed. Neither the federal nor Illinois constitutions were violated by the Illinois Juvenile Court Act's (Act) failure to provide for jury trials in proceedings thereunder. The Act was not constitutionally invalid in providing for the adjudication of delinquency and commitment of the delinquent to the custody of the commission where such adjudication was predicated upon the violation of a lawful court order entered under the Act. The evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the violation occurred. There was no constitutional infirmity in legislation allowing such actions to be taken for misconduct that did not amount to a criminal offense. The minor's commitment was not so shocking to the conscience as to amount to cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

A group of voters contested the election on the ground that the aforementioned standard required by the Illinois Constitution was repugnant to the U.S. Constitution and was therefore invalid. The Board filed a motion to dismiss that was granted. The voters appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that the case involved neither the selecting of representatives in government nor &quot;fencing out&quot; of certain individuals from the voting process. The court found that the concept of &quot;one man-one vote&quot; had never been extended to decision-making elections but rather had specifically been applied only to the selection of persons by popular election to perform governmental functions.

The court held that no unconstitutional discrimination was involved, and that the provisions did not violate the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 2. The court disagreed with the payors' contentions that the provision created a discriminatory disparity within a homogeneous class, or that it operated to create an unconstitutional disparity between the affluent and nonaffluent. Those entitled to bail had different statutory methods to use in securing release, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 110-2, 110-7(f), 110-8 (1963), and the choice was entirely voluntary. Those who chose the provisions of &sect; 110-7(f) constituted a class, but were not automatically placed in that class or category by law.

The court disagreed, holding that prior and later versions of para. 115-4(e) included the state's preemptory challenges and that it was an oversight that the language was omitted. Defendant's objection to the voir dire was sustained, and his sentence was reversed because 21 prospective jurors were excused based on their beliefs against the death penalty. The court rejected defendant's speedy trial claim, holding that the delay was not unreasonable and that he was not prejudiced. Defendant's second trial did not violate his double jeopardy rights because the first trial resulted in a mistrial, not an acquittal. The in-court identifications of defendant were supported by the witnesses' independent recollections, which were adequate to defeat any prejudice from earlier identifications. Defendant was not entitled to assert Miranda violations on behalf of an accomplice who acted as a witness for the state. The evidence was sufficient to establish defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted defendant of possession of marijuana. Defendant appealed on the grounds that the statute under which a search warrant for the search of his apartment was issued, &sect; 108 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 108-4 (1967), was unconstitutional and that the search warrant was void and should have been quashed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police officers searched defendant's apartment pursuant to a search warrant and seized two marijuana cigarettes. The police had searched defendant's apartment prior to the search in which the marijuana was seized. Defendant moved to quash the search warrant and to suppress the evidence on the grounds that &sect; 108- 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 108-4 (1967), the statute under which the police obtained the search warrant, was unconstitutional because it did not require the police to file the complaint upon which the warrant was issued until the warrant had been executed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 108-43 was constitutional where it required a complaint showing probable cause to be reviewed by the issuing judge prior to the issuance of the warrant. Section 108-4 protected the public from unrecorded searches. No constitutional violation was present simply because the police may have violated &sect; 108-4. The search warrant was not void simply because it was signed under a fictitious name, or because the allegations of the complaint were later denied under oath.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, citizens, residents, taxpayers, and property owners (residents), appealed the order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), dismissing a complaint to prevent defendants, city, public building commission, board of education, and park district (city), from building in city parks. The residents argued that the trial court erred in not finding that the city's actions were impermissible violations of the Acts of 1869.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city needed more public schools and recreational facilities. After studying the problem, it made plans to construct a school and a recreational facility in two city parks. The residents filed suit. The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss. The residents appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that the residents who were property owners adjacent to the parks did not have a private property right to continuation of the park use even if adjoining landowners were assessed for special benefits conferred when the parks were established under either the Act to Provide for the Location and Maintenance of a Park for the Towns of South Chicago, Hyde Park and Lake, or the Act to Amend the Charter of the City of Chicago, to Create a Board of Park Commissioners, and Authorize a Tax in the Town of West Chicago, and for other Purposes (Acts of 1869). Although the residents had standing to bring the action under the public trust doctrine, the alleged illegal diversion of use was authorized by the legislature through the Public Building Commission Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, paras. 1031-1054 (1967). There was no unconstitutional delegation of power under the Act.</SPAN></P>

The former litigant and administrator appealed and asserted that the payment of the jury fee was required under the Act only when the services of a jury were actually used.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In plaintiff city's action, defendant demonstrator appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois) that was entered on a jury verdict that found him guilty of violating Rockford, Ill., City Code &sect;&sect; 18.1, 19.2(a). The demonstrator contended that these provisions were unconstitutional. He also contested the imposition of a fine under Rockford, Ill. Code of Ordinances ch. 28, &sect; 1.8, citing arbitrariness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The demonstrator was arrested in a demonstration in front of a school. Rockford, Ill., City Code &sect; 19.2(a) prohibited disturbing noise or diversions next to schools in session. The demonstrator contended that &quot;noise&quot; and &quot;diversion&quot; were vague under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and overbroad for purposes of U.S. Const. amend. I. The court affirmed the judgment. Because the court had previously found that words like &quot;alarm&quot; and &quot;disturb&quot; were sufficiently specific for constitutional purposes, it held here that &quot;noise&quot; and &quot;diversion&quot; were sufficiently specific. Though Rockford, Ill., City Code &sect; 19.2(a) touched upon free speech issues, it protected important societal interests. The constitutionality of &sect; 19.2(a) did not hinge upon possible misapplication. The city exceeded its authority under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, paras. 1-2-1, 1-2-9 (1967) by providing for imprisonment in Rockford, Ill. Code of Ordinances ch. 28, &sect; 1.8. However, the offending part of &sect; 18 was severable. Though part of Rockford, Ill., City Code &sect; 18.1 permitted peaceful picketing of schools embroiled in a labor disputes, this part was narrow and was not an attempt to regulate free speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment that found the demonstrator guilty of violating the city's ordinances and that assessed him a fine.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed the tax purchaser's application for the tax deed, but awarded the tax purchaser part of the proceeds of an eminent domain taking of the land.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner's land was sold for nonpayment of real estate taxes. Because there were no bids on the property, it was forfeited to the State. The tax purchaser bought the land pursuant to &sect; 272 of the Revenue Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 753 (1969). The City of Chicago then filed an eminent domain petition for the land. A judgment for the city was entered in the eminent domain action and the proceeds of the eminent domain award were deposited with the county treasurer. The circuit court then denied the tax purchaser's petition for a tax deed and awarded the tax purchaser only part of the eminent domain award. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that under &sect; 266 of the Revenue Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 747 (1967), the eminent domain award terminated the tax purchaser's right to a tax deed and the landowner's right to redeem the property. Therefore the tax purchaser was entitled to the amount it paid for the land, but not to the entire eminent domain award in lieu of the property where it had no legal title to the property. The first sentence of S.B. 1173 (Ill. June 25, 1970) amending &sect; 266 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A series of continuances were requested by defendants' court-appointed counsel and the State which delayed defendants' trial; defendants were tried and entered their guilty pleas almost eight months after their arrest. Before convicting them, the trial court denied defendants' motion to suppress identification evidence. Defendants appealed their convictions and asserted that they were entitled to be released pursuant to &sect; 103-5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 103-5 (1969), because their constitutional rights to a speedy trial had been violated. In affirming, the court noted that defendants were present and did not object when their counsel requested continuances. The fact that the public defender was provided by the State did not mean that his requests to continue should be charged against the State for purposes of calculating the speedy trial time period. Under &sect; 103-5, the continuances granted at the request of defendants' counsel were delays occasioned by defendants. The victim's identification of defendants shortly after their arrest was not tainted; the victim approached the arresting officers and identified defendants spontaneously.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 16-1(a)(1) (1969).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by the State and paid a fine for disorderly conduct after he had pleaded guilty to violating the city's ordinance for the same conduct. He had previously been fined by the city for the offense. Both prosecutions were based on the same conduct of defendant. He challenged his conviction under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 26-1(a)(1) (1969) on the ground that he was unconstitutionally placed in double jeopardy because he had previously pleaded guilty and been fined for disorderly conduct. On appeal, the court held that the constitutional question gave the court jurisdiction on direct appeal pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110A, para. 603 (1969). The court ruled that the ordinance and the statute under which the prosecutions were brought were substantially similar, and the fact that the ordinance was designed to provide only for a fine did not preclude a finding of double jeopardy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with having taken indecent liberties with a child. He escaped from the jail in which he was being held, but was apprehended several hours later and was charged with escape. He entered a guilty plea. Defendant's application for probation was denied, and he was sentenced to eight to ten years in the penitentiary. More than one year later, he filed a petition in circuit court for leave to appeal as a poor person to the appellate court and for appointment of counsel. The petition was denied because it was not filed within the time provided by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 101.27 (1965). The court found that defendant did not file his petition within the time provided and that the rule, when applied to defendant, who was without counsel from the time of his sentence and who had not been advised of his right to appeal nor of the time limits, was not unconstitutional. The court noted that a state could not grant appellate review in such a way as to discriminate against some convicted defendants on account of their poverty, but could provide for differences so long as the result did not amount to a denial of due process or an &quot;invidious discrimination.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The physician and the hospital had filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that suit had not been brought within the period of the applicable statute of limitations, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 15 (1969).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient brought suit on December 14, 1966 against the physician and the hospital alleging that they, in 1963, negligently advised that a cancerous condition of the patient was non-cancerous, and as a consequence she was required to undergo a forequarter amputation of her left arm, shoulder, and breast. The patient contended that her cause of action for negligence did not accrue until she discovered the negligence of the physician and the hospital. She argued that the cause of action should not be considered as accruing until the discovery of the negligence or until the time it reasonably should have been discovered. Because the two-year period of limitations for tort actions established in &sect; 14 of the Limitations Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 15 (1969), began to run at the time that the patient discovered her true condition or should have known of it and the physician and the hospital's claimed negligence, dismissal of the patient's complaint on the ground that it was barred by the statute of limitations was improper. The court extended the rule of time of discovery to medical malpractice cases such as the patient's.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that defendants' undisputed conduct was clearly unlawful. Defendants argued that the ordinance permitted convictions without any unlawful conduct and in so doing denied them due process of law. The court found no constitutional infirmity in the narrowly drawn ordinance which permitted the police to arrest those who failed to comply with an order to disperse, whether they were spectators or participants in the underlying disturbance. The ordinance was not vague because it defined boundaries sufficiently distinct to review the reasonableness of the officer's decision that defendants had engaged in disorderly conduct. The ordinance was not overly broad and did not infringe on First Amendment rights because the defendants did not have the constitutionally protected right to sit upon cars that they did not own or to assemble in a way that blocked pedestrian traffic on public sidewalks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An accident occurred when the automobile occupied by plaintiffs was struck from the rear by a school bus possessed by the school district and operated by the agent. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to allege that notice of injury had been served on the school district within six months after the accident as required by statute. The trial court, after hearing arguments of counsel, dismissed the complaint with prejudice. On appeal, plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the statute's notice provisions. However, a careful reading of the entire record failed to show that the constitutional question raised on appeal was either presented to or ruled upon by the trial court. The court held that it was absolutely clear from the trial court's order dismissing the case that no ruling whatsoever was made on any constitutional question. The court therefore concluded that it lacked appellate jurisdiction to entertain the constitutional question advanced by plaintiffs. The appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded for a determination of which members of the class were entitled to refunds. Subsequently the intervenors filed a petition for leave to intervene which the trial court denied. The intervenors appealed and contended that they represented a different class who paid the unlawful tax, but not as a separate identified charge. The court affirmed and held that the purchaser who may have borne the tax as a hidden charge was in the same class as the purchaser who bore it as a separate identified charge and was already properly represented by the plaintiffs in the underlying action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment that granted custody to the guardians. The Juvenile Court Act (Act) classified a child as dependent when, in part, they were without a parent. The Act further omitted an unwed father from the definition of &quot;parent.&quot; The court held that the distinction between the classes was rationally related to the purposes of the Juvenile Court and it was not constitutionally mandated that the unwed father be accorded the rights that accrued to the class of natural mothers of illegitimate children. As to the custody rights accorded legal custodians and guardians, the class of legal custodians and guardians consisted solely of persons to whom those rights had been affirmatively granted by the court. Prior to the court's action, legal custodians and guardians had no greater right to control or to custody than did the unwed father. Here, the unwed father, having relied on his belief in his natural rights, failed to seek appointment as custodian or guardian and consequently he could not argue that he was denied an opportunity to secure those rights for himself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, Illinois Highway Trust Authority, the Governor, and various other state officials. The taxpayers filed an action challenging the constitutionality of the Illinois Highway Trust Authority Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 101-1 et seq. (1969).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Illinois Highway Trust Authority Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 101-1 et seq. (1969), created the Illinois Highway Trust Authority as a body politic and corporate to function for a stated purpose of constructing state highways, bridges, and roadside rest areas. The Authority was permitted borrow money, accept grants, and to pledge or encumber all revenues and receipts of the Authority as security for its obligations. It expressly provided that the obligations and debts of the Authority should not be deemed to be obligations of the state. The parties agreed that if the obligation were in fact a debt of the state, the act would be invalid in its entirety. On appeal, the court held that the Act did little more than set up the Authority as a figurehead through which the Department of Public Works and Buildings would continue to administer the actual construction and maintenance of state highways. The court could not find the financial structure of the Authority to be independent of the state. The obligations of the Authority were deemed to be the obligations of the state and a violation of &sect; 18, art. IV of the Illinois Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court. The court held that the Illinois Highway Trust Authority Act was unconstitutional in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
