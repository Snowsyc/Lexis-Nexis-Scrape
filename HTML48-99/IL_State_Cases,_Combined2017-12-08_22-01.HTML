The retail sale of liquor was prohibited in a precinct. The licensees contested the election. The trial court dismissed their action. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding: (1) The statutory system did not violate the home rule provisions of the Illinois Constitution of 1970. The prohibition against sales of alcohol did not disrupt city planning as it affected only one use of the property. The right to engage in the retail sale of liquor was determined by an affirmative vote in the precinct and not according to the zoning ordinance. (2) The statutory system was not an improper delegation of legislative authority. (3) The differences in procedures for referendums based upon the population of communities did not render the statute invalid. Classification on the basis of the population of an area was proper. (4) The complaint did not set forth sufficient grounds to contest the results of the election. The licensees' allegations of voting irregularities were conclusions of fact. (5) A license to sell alcoholic beverages at retail was not subject to due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of La Salle County (Illinois), which convicted him of theft of property having a value greater than $ 150 pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 16-1(a)(1) (1977) and burglary and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of seven years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of theft and burglary, and he appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and remanded the case to the trial court for a clarification of its intent in sentencing defendant. The court held that a jury instruction did not violate defendant's right to due process of law because the challenged instruction described a permissive presumption. The instruction informed the jury that if it found that defendant had exclusive possession of recently stolen property, and there was no reasonable explanation of his possession, it was permitted to infer that he obtained possession of the property by burglary. The court also found that jury was given instructions, which set out the elements of burglary and, which stated that the State had the burden of proving each element beyond a reasonable doubt. The permissive presumption did not shift the burden of persuasion. The court ruled that there was a rational connection between the proved facts and the presumed fact that defendant obtained the property by burglary. The court held that the trial court did not err by not informing defendant of the specific sentences that would be imposed under the sentencing laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to the unlawful possession of phenmetrazine, a Schedule III controlled substance, and the State agreed to dismiss a forgery charge. The Circuit Court of Montgomery County (Illinois) entered a judgment of conviction based upon the plea and denied defendant's subsequent motion to withdraw his plea of guilty and to vacate the judgment of conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that a prior decision rendered unconstitutional the entire Controlled Substances Act possession provision, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1402(b) (1977). The court, however, found that the prior decision was limited to those possession provisions that treated the possession of a controlled substance more severely than delivery of the same substance. In the present case, the possession and delivery of phenmetrazine were treated equally, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, paras. 1401(d), 1402(b). Thus, the enforcement of the possession provision was not unconstitutional. Further, the Act provided, under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1602 (1977), that the invalidation of any provision did not render invalid other provisions of the Act. Because defendant was not placed in a worse position than a comparable person, he had no injury to base an equal protection claim.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1402(a) (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of 30 grams or more of a substance containing heroin, and the court affirmed the conviction. The court found that the record proved in its entirety that the substance obtained from defendant was the same untampered substance that was later tested and found to be heroin. The court also found that the record contained no indication of any tampering with the substance or substitution between the packet taken from defendant and the one later analyzed by the chemist. The court noted that the only support for defendant's contention that two packets existed was the reversal of the last two digits in the six-digit inventory number referred to in the stipulation. However, the court found that the same stipulation stated that the substance tested by the chemist was the same substance recovered by the officer and stated that there was an unbroken chain of custody. The court held that the difference between the numbers was more likely the result of a typographical error. The court found that the Dangerous Drug Abuse Act was rationally designed to further a legitimate state purpose, to treat drug addicts that were more likely to be rehabilitated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Rock Island County (Illinois), which entered a judgment of conviction, after a bench trial, for possession of 1.5 grams of valium capsules, a controlled substance, in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1402(b) (1977). The trial court imposed a two year sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that &sect; 402(b) of the Controlled Substances Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1402(b) (1977), violated the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions, U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. At the time of the conviction, possession of small amounts of the controlled substance was a Class 3 felony while delivery was a Class 4 felony. The court noted that other districts had found &sect; 402(b) of the Act to be unconstitutional and agreed that the present conviction and sentence had to be reversed on equal protection grounds. Possession under &sect; 402(b) was a lesser-included offense of delivery of the same substance under &sect; 401(e) of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1401(e) (1977). Because the possession charge carried a higher penalty than delivery, the sentencing scheme was without rational justification, and, thus, &sect; 402(b) of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1402(b), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a stipulated bench trial, defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance and sentenced to a term of five years' probation with one year periodic imprisonment. The trial court denied defendant's motion to quash and his motion to suppress. On appeal, defendant contended that his case had to be remanded to the trial court for a hearing on his pretrial motion. The court reversed and remanded, finding that the application of the exclusionary rules to those cases where the police had no reason to know that the accused should have been afforded counsel would have failed to serve the policies implicated in all three of the criteria for determining the retroactivity of a standard. The court found further that the doctrine governing when a hearing on a pretrial motion was required should have been applied retroactively. Because the trial court denied defendant's motion based not on its substance but on the face of the affidavit rule in existence at that time, the sufficiency of defendant's allegations was not examined.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), which declared an amendment to the city's zoning ordinance was invalid as applied to property owned by plaintiffs, a bank and an individual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The central issue was whether the city substantially complied with notice and other procedural requirements in adopting the amendatory ordinance. The individual attended the public hearing accompanied by counsel and testified in opposition to the down-zoning amendment, but did not at that time object to the sufficiency of the notice. The first issue the court considered was whether the amendatory ordinance was invalid because the notice requirements of the enabling act and city ordinance were not complied with. There was no requirement in state law that the notice contain a statement of the changes contemplated by the proposed amendment, nor was such a requirement imposed by the city ordinance. Thus, the notice issued was compliant. The next issue the court considered was whether the amendatory ordinance was invalid for failure to comply with several procedural requirements imposed by the city code for initiating and processing zoning amendments. The court determined that the process of initiating the amendment was strictly an internal administrative or parliamentary procedure with none of the ramifications justifying the safeguards of formal legislative action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the city complied with the notice and other procedural requirements of state and local law and that the trial court erred in declaring the amendatory ordinance invalid.

The court held that: (1) a justiciable controversy existed regarding the five percent differential between the price of full service and self-service gasoline fixed by regulation, (2) the regulations that were related to the safety of self-service dispensing of gasoline were a valid exercise of the city's police power and were in the within the purview of the enabling ordinance; (3) the enabling ordinance set standards to guide the commissioner in regulating fairness in pricing; (4) the potential for economic restraint in the retail gasoline market did not outweigh the legitimate government objectives of the regulations, (5) the regulations were not unfairly discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, department and director, citing the Collection Agency Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, paras. 2001-2040 (1977), appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) in favor of plaintiff collection agency in its action to enjoin the department and director from suspending or revoking its certificate of registration and to have a department rule declared violative of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The director had twice rejected hearing officers' recommendations against suspension or revocation and referred the case for rehearing pursuant to the rule. The department and director contended that the collection agency did not exhausted its administrative remedies and that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, paras. 2037-2038 (1977) authorized the rule. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded with directions. The court concluded that equitable relief was appropriate because of the inadequacy of available legal remedies, the futility of the collection agency pursuing administrative relief, and the likelihood of irreparable injury. The court held that the trial court erred in finding the rule unconstitutional on its face, but concluded that the director's construction of the rule exceeded her statutory authority and denied due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court held that the language of the rule providing for referral by the director had to be construed to provide for only a single referral for rehearing. The court held that the trial court encroached upon the director's authority by enjoining all further action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the trial court's order enjoining further re-references to hearing officers, reversed the portions declaring the rule invalid and unconstitutional on its face and enjoining the taking of action to suspend or revoke the collection agency's license, and remanded the case to the trial court with directions to enter an order directing the department and director to proceed to a final decision based on the record.</SPAN></P>

The judgments of conviction were entered in 3 trials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to his conviction for burglary, rape, and deviant sexual assault committed in a day-care center, the court held that identification by the victim was clear and convincing and overcame his alibi defense. The victim's inability to describe features and hesitation to identity went to the issue of credibility for the jury's determination and did not require acquittal. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of convictions for similar crimes because the convictions were recent. As to defendant's convictions for rape, deviant sexual assault, aggravated battery, and two counts of burglary, the state conceded that one of the burglary counts should have been reversed. However, he was properly convicted of aggravated battery because such conviction was not based on the same facts as the rape and deviant sexual assault convictions and it was not an included offense of those other crimes. With regard to his sentences, the court held that the trial court was not required to find that both facts listed under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3.2(b) (Supp. 1978) existed in order to impose extended sentences for the convictions for rape and deviant sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury trial in the Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois) resulted in defendant's convictions for three counts of armed robbery, and one count each of home invasion, burglary, and felony theft. He was sentenced to 20 years for each armed robbery charge, 20 years for home invasion, 7 years for burglary, and 5 years for the theft , all to run concurrently, and appealed his convictions and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found to be in possession of property taken after a home invasion and armed robbery. In affirming his conviction, the court noted that the manner of questioning employed on direct examination indicated that defense counsel was trying to infer innocence on the present charges by the fact that defendant had pleaded guilty to previous charges. That was highly improper and the prosecutor was entitled to refute this inference by establishing a plea agreement. Because an informant was a private citizen and not a paid professional, officers were justified in relying upon his information without independent verification or examination of his reliability. Defendant's recent, exclusive, and unexplained possession of stolen items gave rise to an inference of burglary. In affirming the constitutionality of Class X legislation, the court noted that the methods of rehabilitating the criminal offender had been the subject of considerable, diverse discussion, and held that it was a question peculiarly suitable for legislative investigation, analysis, and action. Ill. Pub. Act 80-1099 had not abandoned the concept of rehabilitation set forth in Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for all charges and the concurrent sentences imposed, including those for Class X felonies.</SPAN></P>

The decedent and his third wife continued living together until they separated. Upon the decedent's death, the aunt filed a petition for letters of administration. The aunt's petition did not include the decedent's third wife as an heir. The third wife filed a cross-petition for letters of administration, listing herself as the decedent's sole heir. The circuit court found in favor of the third wife. The aunt appealed. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 212 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 212(b) (1977), recognized the decedent's marriage to the third wife after the divorce was obtained from his second wife. The court explained that &sect; 212(b) considered parties lawfully married who cohabited after an impediment to marriage was removed. Thus, the court concluded that the third wife was entitled to the decedent's estate because the marriage was lawful from the date of the divorce.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court dismissed the beneficiary's action, and the beneficiary appealed from the judgment. The court noted that &sect; 5 of the Act prohibited corporate trustees from receiving compensation in excess of that allowed to natural persons for like services. The court also observed that the natural trustees of trusts created prior to October 1, 1973 were entitled to compensation expressly specified in the trust agreement, or, if not provided in the trust agreement, to reasonable compensation pursuant to &sect; 1 of An Act Concerning Compensation of Trustees, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 148, para. 31 (1971). Because the trusts involved in the beneficiary's action were created prior to October 1, 1973, the court concluded that the trustee was entitled to the &quot;fair and just compensation&quot; for its services, as provided in the trust agreements.

Stat. ch. 48, para. 39s-4 (1977), authorized a committee to ascertain the prevailing wage rate for the county. A formula was used by the board in arriving at the prevailing wage rate and objections were filed. During an administrative hearing, the trade union representatives presented alternate findings regarding the prevailing wage rate, but the county rejected their theory and reaffirmed the wage rate set forth by the board. The trade union representatives maintained that the county's determination was erroneous. It argued that the county based the wages partly on wages paid on private projects, whereas the statute required that the rate should be determined by reference to wages paid for work of a similar character on public works. The trial court ruled in favor of the county, and the trade union representatives appealed. The court reversed and held that a literal interpretation of the statute did not render it unconstitutional. The standard for determining the wage rate was not &quot;union scale&quot; but was, instead, &quot;public works.&quot; The court concluded that the statute's intent was clearly to determine wages for construction work on public works.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that his that his rights under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 107-14, 109-1 (1977) were violated by the delay between his arrest and his presentation to a magistrate. The trial court found that the provisions of Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers brought an interlocutory appeal from an order of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) denying their motion for a class determination and motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of the validity of property tax assessment. The also contended that a curative statute did not operate retroactively and that the trial court should have stayed the proceedings pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers, who were property owners, sought class action status in a suit against taxing authorities, claiming that certain reassessments were void. In affirming a ruling that there was no valid class, the court determined that the finding that the prerequisites were not met did not constitute an abuse of discretion. It was possible, however, that the taxpayers might have been able to show that a subclass existed (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 57.3(b) (1977)) and on remand the trial court was directed, within its discretion, to determine whether or not such a subclass could be shown. The court held that the statutory notice prescribed was mandatory, so that the reassessments were rendered void. The court also concluded that a curative Act violated the principle of separation of powers insofar as it attempted to validate real estate assessments made without proper notice for all nonquadrennial years prior to its enactment, and because it sought to nullify a prior decision of the Illinois Supreme Court which clearly interpreted the law as it existed. The staying of proceedings was within the discretion of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the finding that the proposed class did not meet the prerequisites, but remanded for a determination of whether a subclass existed, with the direction that if it did there had to be a substitution of attorneys or class representative. The court reversed the finding that the curative statute operated retroactively.</SPAN></P>

Nevertheless, the officers checked defendant's car for beer cans, at which time two hand-rolled cigarettes were seen in the front seat. The officer searched the rest of the car and discovered the drugs that were later used to convict defendant. At a bench trial, the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the confiscated items and all of the statements obtained thereafter. The court, in reversing the convictions, held that the seizure was unlawful because the illegal nature of the hand-rolled cigarettes, in the officer's plain view, was not readily apparent and could not have created in the officer's mind a reasonable suspicion thereof. The court rejected the State's argument that defendant waived his right to complain by failing to file a motion for a new trial, and noted that the waiver rule did not apply where the complaints were raised at the bench trial. Finding that the State failed to show circumstances that dissipated the taint of the illegal arrest, the court concluded that the remaining evidence was insufficient to sustain the convictions.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 37, para. 702-7(3) (1975), was not unconstitutional and that the statute did not violate due process. Moreover, the court determined that defendant's arguments were identical to those considered and rejected by the Illinois Supreme Court in caselaw upholding the statute. Next, the court held that the juvenile court was well within its discretion in transferring defendant to the criminal courts. Nevertheless, the court held that the trial court erred by not permitting defendant to display a scar on his arm to the jury. However, the court held that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in view of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt and did not require reversal. Likewise, the court found no merit in defendant's claim that a black board used by the witnesses in illustrating their testimony constituted a device for &quot;mutual coaching&quot; among the witnesses or that use of the board otherwise prejudiced defendant.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the landlord filed a motion to strike the tenant's affirmative defenses and a motion for judgment on the pleadings, both of which were granted. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that because the tenant was a tenant in sufferance at the expiration of his lease, the landlord was entitled to possession of the property unless the tenant pleaded a valid affirmative defense that created an issue of fact regarding possession of the property. The court found that the tenant's public policy defense under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 80, para. 71 (1977) failed because there was no evidence that the tenant's eviction was retaliatory. Further, the court determined that several of the tenant's other defenses were merely conclusions and were not supported by any facts and that the tenant failed to support his argument that the landlord and the city engaged in a civil conspiracy to evict him.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of rape, deviate sexual assault, and intimidation, which the court affirmed. The court held that the circuit court did not err in precluding testimony of an alleged abortion of the victim because it would only serve to arouse prejudice in the minds of the jurors. The court determined that defendant's proposed testimony as to the victim's unchaste reputation fell within the express prohibition of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115--7(a) (1978 Supp.). Further, defendant's right to due process and his right of confrontation were not violated by the Illinois rape shield law. The court held that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the 24-year-old convictions of defendant for armed robbery into evidence. The circuit court could have determined that the convictions were not too remote in time because defendant was placed on parole only four years prior to the trial. It could also have reasonably considered the length of defendant's criminal record in deciding whether to admit the convictions for purposes of impeachment.</SPAN></P>

Although police knew that defendant had funds to post the bond set by Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 528(c), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110A, para. 110-15 (1977), they never advised defendant of his right to be immediately released upon posting bond.

The court also found that the strip search violated defendants right to privacy under Ill. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of an interlocutory order of the Circuit Court of Logan County (Illinois), which stated that the Mental Health Code did not forbid the production of certain personal material regarding the State's potential witnesses to defendant. The circuit court held that any witnesses who invoked the privilege, or on whose behalf it was invoked, would not be permitted to testify.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with cruelty to persons, maltreatment of a mentally retarded person, and battery. All of the offenses occurred while defendant was an employee of a developmental center. He filed a pretrial motion for discovery, which requested the names and addresses of all persons to be called as witnesses by the State. The State's answer listed 20 witnesses that it intended to call. Defendant filed a motion for additional discovery, which asserted that seven witnesses were residents of the developmental center and that the State maintained personal files on the individuals. On appeal, the court held that it had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The court found that the circuit court's ruling was merely evidentiary and simply removed one item of evidence from consideration by the jury because the circuit court's order only affected seven of the 20 witnesses. The court concluded that the order was not appealable as &quot;suppressing evidence&quot; under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(a). To the extent that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91 1/2, para. 910(b) (Supp. 1978) attempted to provide for appeals from less than final judgment, the court held that it was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) determined that the Illinois use tax was applicable to aviation fuel purchased by plaintiff airline in Indiana and stored in Illinois, the airline moved for an order directing defendant, the director of the state's revenue department, to grant a refund, in a certain amount, from the protest fund into which the tax had been paid. The airline appealed from the trial court's denial of that motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The airline sought a refund in an amount equal to that which the airline had paid to the seller of the fuel in Indiana for payment of Indiana gross income taxes incurred by the seller as the result of that sale. The purchase contracts provided that any tax incurred by the seller by reason of the sale of the fuel would be paid by the airline. The airline contended the trial court erred because the airline was entitled to an exemption by the terms of the Illinois Use Tax Act. The court agreed. The Illinois Use Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 439.3 (sixth unnumbered paragraph (1975), provided that one who had purchased tangible personal property outside of Illinois and had paid a tax in that other state in respect to the sale, purchase, or use of such property was exempt from the Illinois use tax on the use of the property in Illinois to the extent of the amount of tax paid in the other state. When the seller sold the fuel to the airline, the gross receipts from that sale were subject to the Indiana gross income tax; the airline then undertook to pay the tax. Clearly this was a tax paid &quot;in respect to&quot; the sale or purchase of the fuel, which was all the statute required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the cause for entry of an order in accordance with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court allowed defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea and vacate his sentence, but denied the motion to dismiss. Defendant moved for reconsideration. The trial court refused to dismiss the cause. The court held the trial court should have dismissed the possession charge based on the Natoli decision. It held that it had jurisdiction of the appeal because defendant filed his notice of appeal within four days after denial of the motion to reconsider and he was appealing from a final judgment for purposes of appeal. It also found that, regardless of the merits of the State's argument that defendant was estopped from attacking the negotiated guilty plea, his conviction could not stand since the statute under which he was convicted was a nullity. Defendant had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the sentencing provisions applicable to the possession charge.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the Act was not unconstitutional because it encompassed more than one subject: namely, that it included both marriage and divorce and did not violate the doctrines of separation of powers and due process. The Act did not violate the husband's equal protection rights. The trial court properly denied his motion for temporary relief and the subsequent renewal thereof, requesting sufficient mileage allowance, plane fare, and temporary support so that he could appear and attend his deposition and prosecute his property rights against the wife at trial; the uncontradicted testimony of the wife was that the corporation owed him nothing, and his affidavit was lacking in anything factual to substantiate his inability to pay his own expenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of taking indecent liberties with his daughter, a minor. Defendant was charged by indictment with four counts of indecent liberties with a child. Defendant was granted a competency hearing, and it was determined that defendant fit to stand trial even though he was borderline retarded and he suffered from depression. After a bench trial, defendant was found guilty of two of the four charges. Defendant appealed the conviction on the grounds that that the circuit court erred in finding him competent to stand trial, that the circuit court erred in finding that he possessed the requisite mental capacity to commit the alleged crimes, and that the circuit court erred in ruling on certain evidentiary objections. The court affirmed because the question of whether a bona fide doubt existed as to defendant's competency to stand trial was within the sound discretion of the circuit court, and there was no clear showing of abuse of discretion. The court ruled that suffering from a psychiatric disturbance did not in and of itself render defendant unfit to stand trial, for one could be fit to stand trial although his mind might otherwise be unsound or defective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the night of the burglary, defendant was found to have the stolen items in his possession. The basis of his conviction was a common law inference that allowed the jury to find burglary if defendant was found in possession of recently stolen property without a reasonable explanation. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for burglary because the common law inference did not violate defendant's right to due process of law. The use of the common law inference was judged within the context of defendant's individual case and the court determined that the inference satisfied the reasonable doubt standard because the evidence indicated that defendant transported, delivered, and sold the stolen items. The use of the inference did not violate defendant's presumption of innocence because only the burden of production shifted to defendant to rebut the inference. At all times the burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt remained with the prosecution. The actions of the prosecution were proper when the grand jury was reconvened for the purpose of investigating possible additional charges based upon the bill of sale that was produced by defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order specifically stated that the daughter had established that the decedent was her father by a preponderance of the evidence, which evidence consisted of the decedent's attorney's testimony, and legal documents submitted in a custody proceeding in which the decedent claimed that he was the father of the daughter. The court reversed that order because Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110 1/2, para. 2--2 (1975), explicitly provided that the applicable standard of proof for paternity actions was the clear and convincing standard. Furthermore, that standard was certainly different and a higher burden of proof than the preponderance of the evidence standard. The court next held that the decedent's attorney's testimony as to their discussions regarding the daughter were not protected by the attorney-client privilege because those discussions were for the purpose of subsequent public disclosure in the custody proceedings. Also, admission of those discussions laid the foundation for introduction of documents to the same effect. Finally the motion for a blood test was properly denied because it was not reasonably made under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110A, para. 215 (1977).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly before a scheduled city council meeting, eight of the nine Democrats on the city council, along with one independent member, held a caucus. The press did not receive notice of the caucus, and the public was not invited. The issues discussed at the private meeting included both issues on the agenda for that night's city council meeting as well as issues not on the agenda. The state attorney filed action to keep the counsel members from meeting in closed session to discuss city council business. The city counsel argued that the Act did not apply to political caucuses. The court affirmed, stating that characterizing a meeting as a political caucus should not distract attention from the real purpose of the meeting. In this case all the subjects that were discussed were properly business of the city council, and some of the subjects discussed were in fact on the agenda for the council meeting. The court found that the members were meeting as council members, although they were mostly Democrats, and not as a committee of a political party in violation of the Act.

The court rejected the patient's argument that the action fell within the fraudulent concealment exception to the statute of limitations set forth in Limitations Act &sect; 22 for the same reason the discovery rule was inapplicable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent's death was the result of injuries sustained in an accidental fall from a roof. His estate received wrongful death settlement proceeds, which were distributed among his spouse and children as heirs of the estate, and the estate was thereafter ordered closed. The mother of the minor brought an action seeking to open the estate and set aside the awards, based on her allegations that she and decedent had lived together and had produced a minor son who was entitled to a share in the estate proceeds. The trial court denied her request for relief and she appealed. The court affirmed the denial, holding that the section of the Probate Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110 1/2, para. 2-2 (1978 Supp.), was to be applied only to estates that had not been closed in allowing an illegitimate child to inherit from the intestate estate of a decedent father who died prior to September 12, 1978. The court reviewed the three criteria for determining retroactivity of a judicial decision and determined that prospective application was proper. Additionally, the court held that the petition required denial because although it was proper in form, she was unable to show a meritorious defense.</SPAN></P>

The licensed examiners alleged that the unlicensed examiner was in violation of the Illinois detection-of-deception-examiners act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, paras. 2401-2432 (1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensed examiners alleged that the unlicensed examiner's activities reduced their income, and they sought to enjoin him from administering exams. Instead of the polygraph, the unlicensed examiner used a psychological stress evaluator that measured the human voice rather than cardiovascular or respiratory patterns. The Act required that examiners use an instrument that recorded cardio-vascular and respiratory patterns as minimum standards. The circuit court ruled that the unlicensed examiner was subject to the Act. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the Act was unconstitutional. Even though the Act required that a licensed examiner who chose to use another device had to also use a polygraph, the Act permitted the examiner to rely on the test results produced by the other equipment to the complete exclusion of the polygraph results. By permitting an examiner to ignore the polygraph results, the Act made use of the polygraph by such an examiner superfluous. The Act granted to the polygraph a statutory preemption of the field and enhanced the sale of polygraph instruments. The Act was a denial of equal protection and granted a special statutory privilege.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that although the legislature could not pass a retrospective law that impaired the obligation of a contract or deprived a citizen of a vested right, the husband had no vested right to modification, only an expectation that he could seek such relief under the preexisting divorce laws.

The court held that the trial court properly charged defendant with delay of the proceedings occasioned by the filing of his suppression motion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Will County (Illinois), which convicted him of aggravated kidnapping. He claimed that his transfer from juvenile court under the Juvenile Court Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 702-7 (1977), was unconstitutional, an abuse of discretion, and not based on a bona fide determination about his amenability to treatment as a juvenile, and that it was error to refuse his necessity instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, at age 16, was among a group of thugs that commandeered a car entering a highway and robbed the driver at gunpoint. In affirming his conviction, the court noted summarily that the Juvenile Court Act was constitutional. The court next held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in waiving jurisdiction, noting that the offense was a serious one, the evidence tended to prove that defendant threatened the victim, and the trial court had received the testimony of a probation officer that no facilities for delinquent minors existed in the county and that the department of corrections would better serve the needs of defendant. The court held that because the transfer was merely dispositional, due process was served. The court pointed out that the trial court needed only to consider the statutory factors that were present in the case and did not have to accord equal weight to the factors. The court held that it was not error to refuse the necessity instruction in light of the issuance of a better-suited compulsion instruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted them of possession of cannabis and sentenced them to one year felony probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the two laboratory tests, which were performed on the seized substances, did not satisfy the State's burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that they were cannabis. They also argued that the State's failure to purify the substances created a reasonable doubt that the substances were cannabis and that the Cannabis Control Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 701 et seq. (1975) was unconstitutional. The court determined that the trial court's conclusion that the Duquenois-Levine test, when used in conjunction with microscopic analysis, was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the seized substances were cannabis was supported by the State's forensic chemist's testimony. The court explained that the absence of a purification process did not detract from the chemist's conclusion that the substances were cannabis because the trial court had a right to believe the chemist's opinion that no substance other than cannabis would have produced a positive reaction to both of the tests. The court concluded that the constitutional issues, concerning the State's power to make the possession of cannabis illegal, were rejected in a previous court decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners contended on appeal that the trial court erred in dismissing three counts of their complaint, and that the trial court' s decision that the ordinance was not unconstitutional was against the manifest weight of the evidence.

The court held that the two counts properly alleged that the ordinance was invalid due to procedural deficiencies by the plan commission. The court determined that the third count was not justiciable because the motives of members of a municipal authority were not proper subjects of judicial inquiry.

The administrator filed a second amended complaint naming the hospitals and doctors that was dismissed by the trial court as filed beyond the two-year statute of limitations. On review, the court affirmed, holding that because the administrator had not complied with the requirements of &sect; 21, it need not determine the constitutionality of the statute. The court further stated that joinder of additional defendants by amendment to the pleadings after the statute limitations had run was contrary to law under &sect; 46(1) of the Civil Practice Act, Ill.

I, &sect;&sect; 1, 2 (1970). The trial court found that cocaine was not a narcotic drug but denied defendant's motion to dismiss. The court determined that defendant's failure to establish that it was unreasonable to classify the sale of a small amount of cocaine with the sale of a small amount of the opiates was fatal to defendant's argument because the challenged statute related to the delivery of controlled substances, not their use. The court held that the classification of cocaine as a narcotic did not invalidate Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1401(a)(2) (1977) and that the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to dismiss. The court concluded that defendant had no right to choose between specific sentences. The court determined that defense counsel stated that he had explained the alternatives to defendant, and defendant made no claim of inadequacy of counsel.</SPAN></P>

VI and XIV rights to a fair and impartial trial. The court determined that the burden of proof provisions did not affect the trial court's determination. The court explained that where the record as a whole indicated the statutory burden of proof was not a significant factor in the fitness determination, the burden of proving the issue of fitness to stand trial was not ultimately borne by defendant. The court noted that defendant was found fit to stand trial by a preponderance of the evidence because the State's expert witness testified that defendant's epileptic condition would not have prevented him from assisting in his defense. The court concluded that because the evidence of medical negligence was not relevant to any legal defense available to defendant, it was not an abuse of the trial court's discretion to exclude his medical expert's testimony when the defense failed to disclose its intent to present that testimony until after the State had rested its case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician leased a pharmacy in the building where his medical practice was located.

The physician sought judicial review of the administrative decision, and the trial court affirmed his termination. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment affirming his termination from the program. The court held that the IDPA findings were against the manifest weight of the evidence because the only evidence the IDPA produced at the hearing concerned the lease between the medical practice and the pharmacy, and the IDPA neither proved excessive consideration nor introduced any relevant, probative data from which such a conclusion might have been derived.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bill of indictment charged that defendant committed the offense of armed violence in that he, while armed with a dangerous weapon, a pistol, performed a felony prohibited by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-4(b)(1) in that he struck a woman in the head with the pistol, a deadly weapon, thereby causing her bodily harm in violation of para. 33A-2. At trial, the evidence established that defendant did in fact strike the complaining witness on the head with a pistol in a drug store parking lot. On appeal, defendant claimed that he was placed in double jeopardy because the same factor that elevated the offense from the underlying felony of aggravated battery to armed violence, i.e., the use of the gun, was an essential element of proving that underlying felony. The court disagreed, finding that the constitutional concept of double jeopardy protected a person against a second prosecution for the same offense after either acquittal or conviction and protected against multiple punishments for the same offense. Because defendant was neither tried nor punished twice for the same offense, the court found there was no violation of his constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

Further, an offer of proof was made to the effect that the victim had a reputation among children in the neighborhood for violence and aggression. There was further evidence that defendant was aware of the victim's reputation for ferocity and belligerence. The offer of proof also indicated that the victim had a reputation for carrying a gun.

Subsequently, the state added the armed robbery charge by information and defendant was convicted. Defendant contended inter alia that it was unconstitutional to add the armed robbery charge by information because a finding of no probable cause had previously been made on the same charge. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that: (1) because an express finding of no probable cause was not made on the armed robbery charge, it was constitutional to add the same charge by information; (2) defendant's constitutional rights were not violated where cross examination was not permitted on whether a showup identification rather than a lineup had been used because there was no constitutional right to a lineup as opposed to a showup; and (3) the state did not destroy exculpatory evidence by returning the cigarette cartons allegedly stolen from the gas station because while the state was unaware of its exculpatory nature, defendant was aware of its nature, but made no specific request for the cartons.</SPAN></P>

The landowner claimed that the county had no authority to impose the 15-acre limitation on property that was entitled to a statutory agricultural exemption. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the county's power to regulate the landowner's property rights through zoning regulations was expressly limited by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 34, para. 3151 (1975), that the rearing of livestock was an agricultural purpose, that horses were livestock, that the landowner's use of the property was agricultural, and that the county had no authority to establish acreage minimums or to require the landowner to obtain building and special use permits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court reasoned that the prohibitions against boys were classifications based on sex but were justified because they preserved, fostered and increased athletic competition for girls and prevented unfair competition. The court noted that girls were generally at a substantial physical disadvantage in playing volleyball and that classification of a high school volleyball team to limit its membership to girls was consistent with a long-standing tradition in sports of setting up classifications whereby persons having characteristics likely to make them more proficient were eliminated from certain classes of competition. The court held that to furnish exactly the same athletic opportunities to boys as to girls would be most difficult and detrimental to the compelling governmental interest of equalizing athletic opportunities. The court recognized that Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 imposed a stiffer test than federal constitutional requirements, but considered the equalization of general athletic opportunities to be the essence of the application of that section to the public schools of the State and to be a practical, though not absolute, necessity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant worked as a special police officer in a day care center. A police officer testified that on June 15, 1977, he arrested defendant because he was wearing what appeared to be a special police uniform, and on his right sleeve, he was wearing the official patch of the Chicago Police Department. Section 173-9 of the Municipal Code of Chicago provided that every special policeman had to wear a suitable badge, not in the form of a star, which had to be issued to him by the superintendent of police. Although the testimony of the officer suggested that he presented the official patch of the Chicago Police Department to the trial court, the patch was not admitted into evidence. There was no suggestion that the trial court inspected or examined any physical evidence. The prosecution also failed to introduce evidence that showed that defendant had not received the necessary approval to wear the uniform with the patch. The court reversed the conviction without deciding the constitutionality of the ordinance. The court held that the prosecution had failed to establish that defendant had violated the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that plaintiffs' suit was a collateral action and was barred either by public policy or by res judicata. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment for defendants. The court found that plaintiffs' case was barred by res judicata by virtue of a judgment entered on a collector's application. The court noted that plaintiffs had not pursued their statutory remedy under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 716 (1977) of objecting to the collector's application and were thus bound by the judgment and order of sale. The court rejected plaintiffs' argument that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 578 and 597 (1977) unconstitutionally delegated legislative powers because assessment officials were authorized to revise assessments as should appear to them &quot;just.&quot; The court also rejected plaintiffs' argument that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 675 (1977) was unconstitutional as applied. The court stated that if there were any irregularities in the hearings afforded to plaintiffs or the method of valuation, they would have been only procedural and would not have rendered the assessment one &quot;unauthorized by law&quot; which might have exempted plaintiffs' from pursing their statutory remedy.</SPAN></P>

(1971), precluded liability and held (1) the &quot;constitutional tort&quot; doctrine did not apply, and the Act was applicable because the city's action did not constitute a knowing or malicious violation of the nursing home's clearly established constitutional rights; (2) the city could assert any immunity granted to an employee, in this case its licensing board, to preclude its own liability; (3) the city was immune because its licensing determination constituted discretionary action; (4) the legislative classification within the Act, which provided immunity to local public entity licensing decisions but not for the state, was rationally designed to further a legitimate purpose, and (5) contempt remedies were not available because the nursing home was required to seek its remedy from the court which issued the injunction.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 114 -- 12 (1977) of the order of the Circuit Court of Peoria County (Illinois), which granted defendant's motion in limine to suppress fingerprint evidence in a burglary trial because the state had not preserved a piece of glass from which the police lifted defendant's fingerprints.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police technicians lifted the fingerprints from a broken window that the owner of the premises subsequently discarded.

Stat. ch. 110A, para. 604(a)(1) (1977), because the suppression was not based on an involuntary confession or an unlawful search and seizure. The court noted that the motion was based on an alleged deprivation of the constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial and held that the state may appeal an order that had the substantive effect of suppressing evidence. The court then reversed and held that it was not a violation of defendant's due process rights for the state to fail to preserve the object from which latent fingerprints were lifted for defendant's inspection. The court ruled that in the absence of claims that the police forged evidence or framed defendant, it was sufficient that the technician was available for cross-examination, and the fingerprint card was available for inspection by defense experts. The court found that the preservation of objects would be impractical and burdensome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the theft of a bicycle and a moped. After being convicted by a jury, defendant elected to be sentenced under the laws that existed at the time of his offense. Defendant claimed that the trial judge enhanced his sentence based on her belief that he had committed perjury during the trial and improperly required him to elect sentencing without advising him of the sentence. The court affirmed defendant's sentence. The court held that the trial judge explained the range of sentences under the laws that existed at the time of the offense and the laws in effect at the time of sentencing, that the judge was not required to disclose defendant's particular sentence, that defendant's sentencing followed the requirements of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 1001-1-2(a), 1005-3-2(a)(3) (1977), and that the trial judge did not sentence defendant for the additional offense of perjury. The court also held that the substantial disparity in a co-defendant's sentence did not justify a reduction in defendant's sentence under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 615(b)(4), that defendant's sentence was based on proper factors, and that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion.</SPAN></P>

Stat. 264-279 (1975), the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) affirmed the decision of defendant Department of Labor (department) to revoke the employment agency's license to operate a private employment agency. The trial court denied the department's motion to dismiss the action and held that 48 Ill. Comp. Stat. 197i (1973) was unconstitutional. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department's seven-count complaint against the employment agency alleged numerous violations of the private employment agencies act, 111 Ill.

The employment agency alleged that the department's decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court affirmed the trial court and held that the department's order revoking the employment agency's license was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The employment agency's appeal focused on a redetermination of the credibility of the witnesses, but the court's review was limited to whether or not the agency's decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The trial court erred in its sua sponte determination that 48 Ill. Comp. Stat. 197i (1973) was unconstitutional.

Rev. Stat. ch. 40, paras. 101-802 (1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-wife was granted a divorce and custody of the parties' children. Subsequently, the trial court made a disposition of the parties' marital property pursuant to the Act. The ex-wife was awarded the marital residence, subject to the ex-husband's lien interest. The ex-husband appealed, contending that the Act under which the property distribution was made was unconstitutional because it covered more than one subject in violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d), that the trial court erred in its child support order, and in determining his marital residence interest. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part, ruling that all of the provisions of the Act related to domestic relations and were necessary to accomplish the Act's legislative purpose. Thus, they did not violate the constitutional single subject requirement. However, the trial court's finding of an arrearage in child support was incorrect. The court concluded that the ex-husband was entitled to one-half interest in the marital residence when it was sold, rather than the fixed amount awarded by the trial court because fairness required that he shared in any appreciation of his interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed judgment ordering the ex-husband to pay all of the future medical expenses of the minor children, reversed the finding that he was in arrears for child support, and reversed the fixed award of interest to the ex-husband in the marital residence, holding that the ex-husband was entitled to a one-half interest in the marital property at the time of its sale.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the felony status of the crime was unconstitutional because an escape while awaiting a trial on a misdemeanor charge was only a misdemeanor. The court explained that defendant was subsequently found guilty of the arson charge, so defendant was not in a position to challenge the constitutionality of the felony escape charge. The court held that defendant's conduct clearly violated Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 31--6 (1977). The court determined that the legislature had the authority to establish the criminal statutes and corresponding sentences for crimes, and the court would not interfere with the legislature's actions unless the acts shocked the moral sense of the community.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs objected to defendants' plans to build an open air theatre on land in close proximity to them. The court reasoned that to establish standing to challenge a zoning decision determining the use to which defendants' property may be put, plaintiffs had to prove that they suffered a special damages by reason of such use that differed from that suffered by the general public. Plaintiffs had to be persons interested in the controversy and possess a personal claim, status, or right which was capable of being affected. On appeal, the court affirmed defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint. The court reasoned that plaintiffs lacked standing to litigate the validity of the zoning ordinance. The court did not find that plaintiffs' allegations of decreased economic value of their property and that the proposed development would adversely affect their street systems satisfied the standing requirement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An application to preserve the church property as a landmark was pending and the Catholic Bishop decided to close and demolish the church because of the cost of needed repairs, the utility of the building, and the availability of priests. The church members' action to stop the closing and demolition was dismissed. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the church members had no protectible property rights in the church building because there was no statutory trust created and no implied covenant requiring the property to be used for church purposes. The court held that the First Amendment, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, precluded examination of the merits of the church members' claim because the decision to close and demolish the church were matters of church government and as such were ecclesiastical in nature and the mere assertion of a property right was not sufficient to invest a civil court with jurisdiction over what was essentially a religious dispute. The court concluded that the decision was within the exclusive province of the Catholic Bishop, subject only to the decision of the Pope and, therefore, the court lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that the evidence was insufficient to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The victim's testimony was substantially corroborated. The victim's prompt complaint to her family and police, her torn brassiere, her disheveled appearance and tearful behavior after leaving defendant's car, and defendant's thrown rugs found at the scene of the incident were all factors which substantially corroborated the victim's testimony and demonstrated that it was clear and convincing. Any shortcoming in the victim's testimony merely went to her credibility as determined by the jury. Further, the court held that the trial judge properly required defense counsel, for the purpose of establishing a proper foundation, to ask the witness whether she understood that she was to write down all important conversations. Even if there were error regarding the impeachment by omission, it was not grounds for reversal since it did not result in manifest prejudice to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's fire and police commissioners' board found that the police officer had taken goods from a store.

After the two went to the lieutenant's house, the police officer made verbal and written statements to the same effect. There was a hearing before the board. The board discharged the police officer. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case. To avoid equal protection implications regarding warnings before interrogations, the requirements under the Municipal Code of 1961 at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 10-1-18 (1977) and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 10-1-18.1 (1977) had to be read as incorporated into Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 10-2.1-17 (1977). At the restaurant, the lieutenant never apprised the police officer of the offense the police officer allegedly committed, failed to tell the police officer that any statements could be used for disciplinary purposes, and did not inform the police officer to his right to counsel at questioning. Therefore, the police officer's statements were improperly admitted at the hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was severely disabled. While in the hospital, the applicant gave $ 6,000 to his children. The applicant then sought Medicaid benefits, applying for the same with the state public aid department. The public aid department denied his benefits, alleging that he had transferred property for inadequate consideration to obtain public aid. The applicant appealed to the trial court, which affirmed. The applicant appealed and the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the Social Security Act expressly forbade the blanket disqualification procedure of &sect; 3-1.3 of the Illinois Public Aid Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, art. III, para. 3-1.3 (1977). The court found that non-available assets could not have been deemed available, and that the availability of specific assets could not have been given a currency beyond their actual value by a failure to have applied their worth to the debt in question. The court found that the five-year ineligibility provision of &sect; 3-1.3 of the Illinois Public Aid Code and the state public aid department's regulation promulgated under it violative of the Social Security Act and the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the lower court and remanded the cause to the state public aid department for a redetermination of the applicant's eligibility for Medicaid, taking into account only the actual value of the asset he transferred and providing assistance for any medical expenses that may still have been owing after such a computation.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed in part because the prosecution conceded that the convictions for unlawful possession of cocaine and the unlawful possession of marijuana were improperly entered. Affirming the remaining judgments of convictions, the court stated in part that probable cause to support the issuance of a search warrant was shown by the affidavits of two police officers, which detailed the strict search and surveillance of an informant and his return with a supply of cocaine. The court rejected the argument that defendant's conclusory denial of the purchase of cocaine by the informant as alleged in his affidavit constituted a sufficient challenge to the credibility of the officers upon the hypothesis that they could not have received &quot;that which defendant did not sell.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The salesperson filed a complaint with the Fair Housing Board, which found that defendant had violated &sect; 13-6(a)(5). The city then instituted legal action against defendant, and he was found guilty. Defendant alleged that his actions did not constitute a violation of the ordinance and that it was unconstitutional. In reversing the decision, the court stated that &sect; 13-6(a)(5) was to be strictly construed because it was punitive in nature. To be guilty of an unlawful real estate practice under &sect; 13-6(a)(5), the city had to establish that the disposition of the property was prohibited to any person because of race, color, religion, or national origin and that defendant knowingly acted or undertook to act with respect to the property.

The owners filed a post-trial motion that contended the basis for denying the special use permit had been preempted by state and federal statutes, which was denied. Upon review, the court reversed. It found that trial court's finding that the county had drawn a line and determined a saturation point was erroneous because there was no evidence in the record that such a &quot;line&quot; existed. The owners properly preserved the issues of a local government's power to regulate aircraft noise and safety for review by filing their post-trial motion. The county did not zone properly on the basis of aircraft noise because there were no standards for noise set out in the ordinance and there was no objective determination of the effects of such noise on the owners' neighbors. Because the Illinois State Division of Aeronautics had approved the use of the RLA, the county had to bring forward some objective evidence of a particular safety problem or hazard specific to the owners' RLA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1973, the law provided a police officer a pension if he had 20 years or more of service and had reached the age of 50, with the pension increased by one percent for each year of service over 20 years, to a maximum limit of 60 percent of his salary prior to retirement. In 1975, the one percent increment was increased to two percent for each additional year of service and the maximum limit was increased to 75 percent of salary. The officer retired in 1973, at age 47, and upon attaining the age of 50, he was given his pension. Originally his pension was based on the 1975 statute; however, it was subsequently reduced to the amount due under the 1973 statute. The officer sought mandamus relief to require the Board to return his pension to the amount under the 1975 state. The trial court dismissed his action and the court affirmed. It found that when the statute was amended to increase pension amounts, deductions from the salaries of police officers also increased. As the officer was not subject to the increased deductions, his construction of the amended statute was unconstitutional, as it would allow him to an increased payment without making additional payments into the fund.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the appellate court order in question had been entered in a civil action brought by defendant's employer, an off-track messenger services for horse bettors. Despite the fact that the appellate court's order did not apply to the criminal statute prohibiting gambling, defendant, a lay person, reasonably believed that, by virtue of the order, her questioned employment activities were protected from interference by the State. The spirit of the rule of the statutory defense of reliance, Ill. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a health services corporation, individuals, and a judge, challenged the decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed their action, brought on behalf of operators of drug abuse treatment programs, certain drug addicts, and resident-taxpayers, to prevent defendant state executive branch officials from withholding funds appropriated by the general assembly for the use of the Dangerous Drugs Commission (DDC).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DDC was charged with the responsibility of administering drug abuse treatment programs. The complaint alleged that the general assembly had passed an appropriations bill that included a line item amount to be used by the DDC for the purchase of drug abuse treatment services. The Governor, through his agent, reserved a specific amount of this appropriation for state budgetary reasons. Plaintiffs sought to prevent the Governor and his agents from interfering with the allotment and expenditure of funds. On appeal, the court held that the important issue was whether the appropriations act authorized the Governor to reserve part of the funds essentially eliminating them from the DDC budget and circumventing the commission's discretionary decision making power. The court held that there was no statutory basis for permitting the Governor to withhold the funds. The court reasoned that the general assembly was vested with the ultimate authority to determine the level and allocation of public spending. The court held that the Governor was given no express authority by the state constitution to reserve appropriated funds in frustration of the general assembly's expressed intent.</SPAN></P>

The Board found that the petroleum company and the transportation company violated &sect; 9(a) of the EPA. The petroleum company appealed. In reversing as to the petroleum company, the court held that (1) the Board had jurisdiction to hear the case because it dealt with a matter of local regulation regarding air pollution; (2) the record did not show any admissible evidence that indicated that the petroleum company exercised sufficient control over the source of the pollution in such a way as to have caused, threatened, or allowed the pollution; and (3) it was error to find that the petroleum company violated &sect; 9a of the EPA.</SPAN></P>

The policeman asserted entitlement to a pension under Ill. Rev. Stat. &sect; 3-114 (1971), and protected by Ill. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The policeman worked for 11 years as a patrolman and then was placed on disability, at which time the policeman ceased making contributions to the police pension fund and began receiving a disability pension. Upon retirement, the policeman claimed that under Ill. Rev. Stat. &sect; 3-114 (1971), he was entitled to elect to be paid a regular pension, in lieu of his disability pension, equal to one-half of the salary attached to his rank the year preceding his retirement on regular pension. The board asserted that Ill. Rev. Stat. &sect; 3-116.1 (1973), which repealed &sect; 3-114, applied, and that the policeman's regular pension was equal to one-half of the salary attached to his rank at the date of his retirement on disability pension. In affirming the lower court, the court held that &sect; 3-116.1 could not constitutionally apply to the policeman, and that he was entitled to receive benefits under the relevant sections of the Pension Code as in effect at the time the constitutional provision became effective. The court held that the purpose of Ill. Const. art.

The court found no support for the defense position that the election statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch., para. 1008-2-4(b), (1978), required a defendant be given a choice between specific sentences. Defendant was informed of his right to elect under which law he would have been sentenced, and he was also informed of the differences and consequences, which would have flowed from an election under either sentencing law. Defendant's election, so far as the trial court needed to provide, was a knowing and informed one. The two classes of persons identified by the defense as similarly situated were differently situated so far as applying the sentencing laws was concerned. There was no denial of due process or equal protection to the person situated, as was defendant, who had elected to be sentenced under the sentencing law in effect at the time of his offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff horse owners filed an action against defendants state officials, humane society and agents in the Circuit Court of Bureau County (Illinois). The horse owners sought declaratory relief with respect to certain portions of the Humane Care for Animals Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 8, pars. 701-716, and damages. The trial court dismissed the complaint for declaratory relief and the horse owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court based its decision upon the failure of the horse owners to pursue review remedies set forth in the Administrative Review Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1977, ch. 110, pars. 264-279. The court found that the authorization for impoundment of the horse owners' horses and the impoundment by the state agency was not a final administrative action by the agency. Rather, that action was subject to further administrative review procedures within the agency. Therefore, the decision in the case was not a final administrative decision authorizing judicial review under the Administrative Review Act, and the trial court's conclusions that it was a final decision and that the failure of the horse owners to pursue review waived their right to review was clearly erroneous. The court further held that the administrative review procedures available to the horse owners under the agency's rules and regulations afforded them an adequate remedy within which to challenge the actions they complained of. Since they failed to pursue the administrative remedies available to them, they could not obtain judicial review in the courts in this proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a former county treasurer and banker, were convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) on charges including bribery, violation of a county treasurer's act, official misconduct, and corrupt practices in connection with an arrangement under which the treasurer caused public funds to be deposited in the banker's institutions in return for favorable personal credit terms. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The treasurer and the banker appealed their convictions for bribery, corruption, official misconduct, and violation of the County Treasurer's Act (CTA). The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court rejected challenges to the CTA's imposition of sanctions based on county population, finding that its classification was reasonable and that its prohibition against payment of &quot;fees, perquisites and emoluments&quot; adequately described targeted conduct. Venue was proper in the place where the treasurer served. The court upheld the lower court's refusal to sever the trials, rejected various claims of evidentiary errors as meritless or harmless, approved the denial of a continuance, found no errors as to venire, and turned away a statute of limitations claim. Challenges to jury instructions were also rejected. However, the court reversed the treasurer's CTA and corruption convictions because the indictment failed to charge a culpable mental state. Finding that the remaining convictions for misconduct (the treasurer) and for bribery (the banker) were based on the same underlying conduct as the more specific charges, the court reversed the convictions for the more general offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the treasurer's conviction for violating the CTA, for violating the corrupt practices act, and on counts of official misconduct, and affirmed his conviction for bribery. The court also reversed the banker's convictions for bribery and affirmed his convictions for violating the county treasurer's act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed a class action suit on behalf of Illinois taxpayers residing outside of the county. The complaint sought to hold that the provisions of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 394 (1973), &sect; 21 of the Inheritance and Transfer Tax Law, were unconstitutional due to the adoption of Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 9(a). In a related suit the Illinois Supreme Court found the statutory provision in question to be unconstitutional. The circuit court therefore granted a judgment on the pleadings to the taxpayers, order the county to file an accounting of the funds, enjoined the county from transferring or disposing of these funds, and, in a later order, awarded attorneys' fees to the taxpayer. The award of attorneys' fees was appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision to award attorney's fees. The court held that the money from which the attorney's fees were to be paid were the property of the State, so that the State had standing to appeal. The court further held that the State had not waived its sovereign immunity to permit any court other than the court of claims to grant a judgment against the State's funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial, the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entered judgment convicting defendant of burglary and unlawful use of a weapon in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 19-1, 24-1(a)(10), and 24-1(b) (1977). Following sentencing, defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While completing an arrest in a resident hotel, a police officer observed a man pointing a rifle through a partially opened door. The officer and others entered the apartment behind the door and discovered defendant and two others. Defendant was subsequently arrested. An investigation revealed a gun dropped by defendant was stolen in a burglary. On appeal, defendant contended that the State failed to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt because the evidence of his possession of the proceeds from the recent burglary did not support the inference that he committed burglary beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, he asserted the State failed to demonstrate that when arrested carrying a loaded weapon, defendant was not in his own abode as required by statute. The court affirmed the two convictions for burglary and unlawful use of a weapon because the State sustained its burden of proving defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court, however, remanded because the failure to impose two sentences rendered the judgment of convictions incomplete.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment entered upon the convictions for burglary and unlawful use of a weapon. The court also affirmed the one sentence imposed. However, the court remanded with directions to clarify the record as to which offense sentence was imposed and for entry of a second sentence for the conviction upon which no sentence was previously imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies which operated forging facilities within the state brought the petition. The companies challenged the stationary source noise emission regulations promulgated by the PCB, claiming that title VI of the Act and the regulations, themselves, were unconstitutional. The court held that the regulations were valid and affirmed them. Pursuant to &sect; 29 of the Act, the court's review was limited only to the rules and regulations promulgated by the PCB. Nowhere was there authority for the court to consider, as a trial court of original jurisdiction, a challenge to title VI of the Act. Thus, the court was without jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of title VI of the Act. Pursuant to case law precedent, the stationary noise source regulations did not violate equal protection. The appropriate standard of review of the PCB regulations was whether they were arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. Thus, the court was without authority to reweigh the evidence and invalidate the regulations. No federal act expressly reserved the exclusive power to regulate the field of noise control. Thus, there was no express or implied preemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former police officer filed a class action in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) on behalf of himself and other officers whose pensions were terminated by defendant, Retirement Board of the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund, upon their convictions of felonies relating to their service as policemen. The court dismissed the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the Retirement Board of the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund was established under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 8 -- 101 et seq. (1977) to provide retired policemen with pensions and other benefits. After leaving the police force, plaintiff was convicted in a United States District Court of extortion in relation to his duties as a police officer. After an administrative hearing, the Board revoked his pension under para. 5 -- 227. Plaintiff appealed the order of dismissal and asserted that the pursuit of administrative remedies would impose a mere procedural duty to engage in a time-consuming and expensive administrative review process to secure a predictable outcome. The court held that plaintiff's purported class action was not filed in accordance with the Administrative Review Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 264 et seq. (1977) and was therefore barred. The court affirmed the order dismissing the class action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim of the battery testified that on the night in question, defendant invited him to take a ride in his recently acquired pickup truck. After they reached the turnaround of a dirt road off the highway, defendant parked and started an argument about $ 20 that the victim had taken from defendant months earlier. Without provocation, defendant hit the victim above his left eye with a bottle. The resulting cut in the victim's eyebrow was cleaned at a hospital, but no stitches were required. Defendant was convicted of aggravated battery under para. 12-4(b)(8) because the trial court found that the battery took place &quot;on or about a public way.&quot; Defendant appealed, and the court reversed. The court held that the incident involved in the case, which occurred some 95 to 100 feet from the public way, did not occur &quot;on or about a public way.&quot; However, although defendant was not proved to have committed aggravated battery, the trial court found and the court concluded that defendant was proved guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, of &quot;simple&quot; battery, which was a violation of Ill.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In April of 1977, defendant was charged with unlawful possession of cannabis. Three days later defendant's counsel filed a demand for immediate trial. After several delays attributable to defendant, defendant was filed in July 18, 1977. The State's motion to dismiss the information with leave to reinstate due to the mysterious disappearance of a material witness was granted. The missing witness was subsequently located and, in January of 1978, defendant was indicted. In February, defendant filed motion to discharge under the speedy trial act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 103-5 (1977). The motion was granted. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant was entitled to trial within 160 days of the demand for speedy trial made in July of 1977. The statute was not tolled, as the State contended, when the original information was dismissed because the circumstances suggested that the State sought to circumvent the statutory time requirement by dismissing the action rather than petitioning the circuit court for a continuance to locate the material witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, who had previously been divorced from the widow, died about seven months after marrying her a second time.

Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 14-160(a)(1) (1975), because she was married to the employee less than one year before his death. In affirming the denial of the widow's claim, the court held that classification of spouses into those married less than one year before a State employee's death and those married one year or more was rationally related to prevention of &quot;deathbed&quot; marriages entered solely to enable another person to become eligible for System benefits. Section 14-160(a)(1) of the Illinois Pension Code referred to a particular marriage contract and did not permit &quot;tacking&quot; of separate marriage contracts to meet the one-year requirement. The System's regulations authorized use of a bystander's report of proceedings before the claims committee; due process did not require that the committee pay a stenographer's fees as long as there was a means to allow for effective appellate review.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in permitting a portion of defendant's statement about a gasoline station robbery the previous night to go to the jury. The court held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the probative value of the evidence for its limited purpose outweighed its prejudicial effect. Defendant argued that the instruction confused the jury into believing that there was a lesser standard for determining defendant's accountability. However, some evidence supported every element of the instruction. The giving of the instruction was not error. Defendant objected to the introduction into evidence of two pictures of the torn-up faces of the victims. As these items were not shown to the jury, defendant was not prejudiced by their admission. Further, the trial court was not in error in admitting, for impeachment purposes, evidence of defendant's federal convictions. The trial judge performed the balancing test and did not abuse his discretion in admitting the evidence. The convictions and sentences of defendant were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The recording was inaudible, and the witness gave a written statement concerning defendant's offer. The trial court denied defendant's motion in limine to exclude a detective's testimony, but limited the scope of his testimony to matters within the State's offer of proof. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction by the trial court. Para. 11-16(a)(2) was not unconstitutionally vague because the plain and ordinary meaning of the statute's language was of sufficient specificity to provide notice of what conduct was prohibited. The State's opening statement was not a basis for reversible error because the State made a good faith effort to provide evidence related to defendant's motive, intent, or design. Instruction to the jury negated prejudice from the detective's testimony that exceeded the scope allowed by the trial court. The designation of one of the State's witnesses as a court witness was justified by the State's surprise at her testimony. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury's guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action, plaintiff sauna owner appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois) holding that Rockford, Ill., Massage Establishments and Massage Services Ordinance &sect;&sect; 13, 16 were constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Rockford, Ill., Massage Establishments and Massage Services Ordinance &sect; 8 provided that it was unlawful for any person holding a permit under the section to treat a person of the opposite sex except in certain specified circumstances. The city argued that a compelling interest, which would be necessary to prohibit a person from massaging a person of the opposite sex, existed in prohibiting conduct which was obscene or which was a public nuisance. In affirming that part of the trial court, which found &sect; 8 of the ordinance to be unconstitutional, the court held that it could not say that there existed a compelling state interest for the sex-based classification. The court reversed that part of the judgment, which held that &sect; 16 was constitutional. Section 16 allowed police to inspect massage establishments twice a year. Because the ordinance allowed warrantless administrative searches of nonpublic areas of business buildings, it was unconstitutional. Section 13 regulating advertisement was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1410 (1975). Defendant had previously been placed on first offender probation under &sect; 410.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been convicted of a heroin possession. He was placed on first offender probation and was required to pay the costs of the proceeding as a condition of the probation. The cause was then continued. Defendant filed a notice of appeal. Subsequently, the Illinois Supreme Court held in another case that imposing fines and costs under &sect; 10 of Cannabis Control Act, which, similarly, dealt with first offender probation, was not authorized. The People contended that because defendant made no objection to costs at sentencing, the cost issue was waived. The court reversed the order. Defendant had not waived the costs issue because the supreme court case was not decided when the costs were assessed. The legislature's attempt to retroactively apply the part of the 1978 amendments to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, paras. 710, 1410 (1977), violated separation of powers under Ill. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1. The amendment at issue was also an unconstitutional ex post facto law because it increased the punishment for a crime through an amendatory act that took effect after the crime. The court held that the supreme court case applied prospectively. The supreme court's decision bound the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal challenged the constitutionality of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 70, paras. 51 to 57 (1977). The father contended that the Act deprived the parent of property without due process of law by imposing liability without regard to fault, created an unreasonable classification by imposing vicarious liability on a parent or guardian of a minor from 11 to 18 years of age, and was not a valid exercise of the police power and did not have a reasonable relationship to the objectives sought to be attained. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the father had not met the burden of showing that the Act was unconstitutional. The court noted that the purpose of the Act was two-fold: (1) to compensate innocent victims of juvenile misconduct that was willful or malicious; and (2) to place upon the parents the obligation to control a minor child so as to prevent intentional harm to others. The court held that the purpose of the Act was a proper one and that the means employed was substantially related to the end sought and that therefore it was a fair and reasonable exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>

The property owners asserted that the state had not properly exercised its right of eminent domain. The court affirmed the denial of the property owners motions to dismiss and for a continuance to conduct discovery. The court refused to consider constitutional challenges to the quick-take statute and the payment of judgment interest because they were not raised before the trial court. The request for discovery was properly denied because there was no good cause found for the discovery and the property owners admitted they were not prejudiced by any lack of discovery. And, while the property owners' traverse should have been considered before the state's quick-take motion, the trial court's failure to do so was not reversible error.

The students were not only transported to and from the physical site of the school, but also were at that site primarily for the purpose of attending school.

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1003-6-4(a) (1975), relating to enforcement of prison discipline. Defendants challenged the definiteness of &sect; 3-6-4(a), their selection for prosecution, an alleged double jeopardy violation, and their absence during a communication between the judge and jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several guards were assaulted and taken hostage, and an entire cellblock was held under prisoner control. The court held that &sect; 3-6-4(a) met due process standards. Although the words &quot;participate&quot; and &quot;disturbance&quot; could be too vague if found in a general &quot;breach of the peace&quot; ordinance, they were sufficiently precise in a statute written specifically for the prison context where the prohibited disturbances were easily measured by their impact on the normal activities of the prison. Moreover, the record indicated that defendants were among the most active participants in both the holding of the hostages and the disturbance as a whole. Although other inmates who participated in the disturbance were not criminally prosecuted, defendants did not show that the selection for prosecution was deliberately based upon an arbitrary classification. There was no double jeopardy violation because administrative discipline of a prisoner did not prohibit criminal prosecution for the same event. Finally, defendants were not prejudiced by their absence during the communications between the trial court and the jury because defense counsel was present and the jury's question was a purely legal one.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association filed an amended two-count complaint against defendants. Count I challenged the constitutionality of the rezoning. It did not seek directly to void the annexation. In count II, plaintiff, a not-for-profit corporation, asked to be declared the sole owner of Echo Lake and to enjoin defendants from using the lake for any purpose. Count I was dismissed. The village alleged that count I was barred by the statute of limitations. On appeal, the court noted that one issue was whether the association could attack the rezoning without attacking the annexation. The court found that if the pre-annexation agreement was to be given any legal force, a successful attack on the rezoning could result in a lawsuit by the owners to declare the annexation void. The association argued that the one-year statute of limitations did not apply if the officials annexing the territory did not have jurisdiction of the subject matter. The court held that the elected officials of the village had the lawful power to grant applications for zoning; thus, they had the subject matter jurisdiction required by the statute. The court affirmed the order of the circuit court in regard to count I.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 3081 et seq. (1977). The Circuit Court of Macon County (Illinois) held that they were County employees, and the County appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Bogardus Law, the Commission was established in the County to assist needy veterans and their surviving family members. The executive powers of the Commission were vested in the Superintendent, who was elected by members of the Commission. The Commission employed several workers to assist the Superintendent. The workers were dismissed. The Superintendent initiated an action for declaratory relief. The trial court held that the workers were employees of the Commission and were subject to hiring and discharge under the Commission's rules. The County claimed that portion of the Bogardus Law, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 3090 (1977), which authorized the Commission to appoint its Superintendent, was unconstitutional. In reversing the decision and remanding, the court found that paragraph 3090 was unconstitutional because it provided for the selection by the Commission of the Superintendent, who exercised the sovereign power of the government. Once the proper chain between the Superintendent and the electorate was established, the Superintendent had the power to hire and fire workers. The workers could not then be subject to the County's policies.</SPAN></P>

The evidence at trial established that defendant and an accomplice robbed a victim at gunpoint with a sawed-off shotgun. A shot was fired, and the victim was found dead. An informant told police that defendant admitted to the crime. Police forced their way into defendant's home while he was away and recovered blood-stained clothes. The accomplice turned State's evidence and testified that defendant held the shotgun on the victim. Defendant argued that the evidence against him was tainted fruit of an unconstitutional search. Finding no prejudicial error, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction because when the officers arrived at defendant's home, they clearly had probable cause to arrest him. The court held that the fact that defendant was known to be armed justified the warrantless entry. As to whether the accomplice was truthful, the court held that it was immaterial because defendant would have been guilty of felony murder even as an accomplice.</SPAN></P>

Because the application for judicial approval of the eavesdropping device recited the consent of the undercover officers who participated in the conversations, the court found that it was not faced with a constitutional question. The restrictions on the recording of a conversation were statutory and not constitutional. As Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 108A -- 3(a)(2)(d) (1977), provided for that type of approval and as there was apparently no other complaint regarding the application, there was no error in admitting the evidence of the videotape.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1012(a), and Rules 951 and 952 of the Illinois Pollution Control Board Rules and Regulations (Rules). The Circuit Court of Madison County (Illinois) entered an order dismissing the complaint with prejudice and denying a preliminary injunction. The government appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order also dissolved a previously issued temporary restraining order and found Rule 951 unconstitutional although the validity of the Rules were never challenged by the apartment building owners. On appeal, the government contended that the complaint was legally sufficient to state a cause of action and established its right to injunctive relief. The government also contended that Rule 951 was a valid exercise of the state's police power and did not violate the Illinois Constitution or the United States Constitution. The court reversed and held that the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The court found that the well-pleaded facts, and the reasonable and fair inferences therefrom, alleged all essential elements of a violation of &sect; 12(a) of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1012(a). Further, the court held that the government was not required to prove irreparable damage or an absence of an adequate remedy at law where the Act authorized the government to bring an action for injunctive relief upon a violation of the Act by the apartment building owners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the cause to the trial court for entry of a preliminary injunction and for trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a chiropractor, was arrested on the charge of having illegally performed an abortion. He was convicted based on evidence that he had knowingly performed an abortion on a minor female, and he appealed. On appeal, he argued that the abortion control statute was unconstitutional and that there was insufficient evidence to convict him. Both arguments were rejected. As to the constitutional challenge to the abortion statute, the court noted that a federal decision deeming the statute unconstitutional dealt with the portion of the statute that criminalized the causing of a miscarriage. That clause was not in issue, as there was no dispute that defendant performed an abortion. The portion of the statute requiring that one be a physician was not unconstitutional, and thus defendant could properly be convicted under it. As to defendant's insufficiency claim, the court noted that all defendant was arguing was that the prosecution's witnesses were unworthy of belief. That was a trial court question, not an appellate court question.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1406(a)(3) (1977). The Circuit Court of Coles County (Illinois) dismissed the charge as time-barred under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 3-5(b) (1977).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In addition to dismissing the charge, the circuit court granted the State leave to file an amended count before a certain date. Defendant requested that his bond be returned. The bond was not discharged. On appeal from the dismissal of the charges, the State contended that the offense alleged was a continuing one and that the last date upon which the offense was alleged to have occurred was within the 18-month limitation period, thereby rendering that limitation inapplicable. Defendant contended that the court lacked jurisdiction because the order of dismissal was not appealable. The court first determined that the circuit court's order was appealable because the &quot;substantive effect&quot; of the order was to dismiss the charge; the record did not show whether the circuit court ruled upon defendant's request to discharge his bond. In reversing the order, the court held that the circuit court erred in dismissing the charge as time-barred because the offense could have been a continuing one; the references to &quot;keeping&quot; records in both Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1406(a)(3) and 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 827 compelled a conclusion that such an offense was to be construed as a continuing one.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the jury determined the value of the property, the Park District deposited the amount, with accrued interest, with the Treasurer. The condemnee could not accept the amount and appeal at the same time. It argued that it had neither the benefit of the property nor the use of the money, thus, it was entitled to receive the interest earned on the amount deposited during the pendency of the appeal as part of its just compensation. The court rejected the argument. When the Park District deposited the award with the Treasurer, the statutory and constitutional requirements of just compensation were satisfied. The award when paid fixed the rights of the parties as of the date of the taking. The condemnee next contended that the interest earned should be paid to it because the Treasurer acted as its trustee while the award was on deposit. The court found no trust relationship existed. It also found no legislative grant of authority to the Treasurer to pay out any earnings accruing on deposited condemnation awards. To the contrary, the Treasurer was required by statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 36, para. 17 (1977) to credit such earnings to the county corporate fund.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the dismissal of the homeowners' claim. The court affirmed the dismissal of the claim in negligence based on Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para. 3- 106 and 108(a) (1977), which granted immunity for ordinary negligence by a local public entity on property used as a park. The court also held that the negligent conduct of a State agency, although resulting in damage to a person's property, did not amount to a deprivation of that person's constitutional right to property. The court held that conduct that could be actionable under common law did not necessarily arise to a constitutional dimension merely because a public body was involved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor was licensed to practice medicine in Illinois and in Michigan. The revocation of his license in Michigan was the basis for the Department to revoke his license in Illinois, and the doctor filed an action against the Department challenging its revocation. The trial court ruled in favor of the Department and the doctor appealed. The court ruled in favor of the Department and the doctor sought rehearing, arguing that the court erred in refusing to consider his argument that para. 16a(11) was unconstitutional in that it improperly delegated authority over Illinois licenses to other states. The court noted that the doctor had not raised his issues in the trial court and stated that where no constitutional question was presented to or passed upon by the trial court and the only question was the interpretation of a statute, a constitutional question was not present on appeal. The court found further that the arguments that the doctor was attempting to raise on rehearing had not been raised in his original appellate brief, therefore under Ill. Sup. Ct.

Although not previously found delinquent, he had been placed on supervision for charges of criminal damage to property, a violation of Ill. Rev.

He admitted his truancy. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in revoking defendant's supervision on the basis of his violation of the conditions of supervision because there was no evidence the trial court had ever specified the terms and conditions of the supervision, as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 705--3(9). If the trial court had formulated written rules, there was nothing in the record to indicate that defendant received them. A child was still entitled to constitutional due process protections. Because he was never told what rules to obey, defendant could not found to have violated them. The trial court's statements admonishing him to listen to his mother and stay out of trouble were too vague to satisfy constitutional concerns.

The court affirmed the conviction and held that the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of indecent liberties with a child because even though there was no direct evidence of defendant's contact with a sex part of the child because the act of defendant in kissing and touching the child, coupled with the mental intent to arouse the sexual desires of either the child or himself was sufficient to give defendant notice that he was violating the indecent liberties with a child statute. The court held that it was improper to allow the introduction of evidence of prior incidences with young girls and defendant's prior confinement where there was insufficient similarity between the previous acts and the current offense to constitute a common scheme or design. However, the court found that the error was harmless because the remaining evidence was sufficient to warrant a conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance was not vague or overbroad, but that it improperly made possession of materials a crime and that it was invalid for failing to provide for the application of a statewide community standard for evaluating obscenity and failed to adopt the utterly without redeeming social value test in defining obscenity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners owned two adjoining lots in the City, which they divided into three lots. They applied for a building permit from the City to construct a house on one of the lots. Defendants denied the permit because the division of the lots did not comply with the bulk regulations in Chicago, Ill., Mun. Ordinances ch. 194(A), art. 5, para. 5.7-2 (1974). The court determined that some of the consequences of the landowners' division of the improved zoning lots were exactly those intended to be prevented by the enactment of bulk regulations prescribing the width of the side yards. The court concluded that the landowners did not demonstrate a clear and unambiguous right to the issuance of the permit. The court determined that while their infraction of &sect; 5.7-2 may have been slight, it made their claim for a permit equivocable. The court explained that the record did not disclose evidence that the application of &sect; 5.7-2 through the strict enforcement of the side yard bulk regulation was unreasonable or arbitrary. The court noted that no evidence in the record overcame the presumption that the minimum width requirement for side yards bore a relationship to the public welfare.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 32, para. 157.87, 157.89 (1977). On the creditor's appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Illinois statutory law did not require service by summons for creditors because trial courts were vested with the discretion to determine what type of notice was to be afforded. Further, &sect; 89 of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 32, para. 157.89 (1987), complied with state and federal due process requirements because due process required only that the form of notice should have been likely to be received and plain to understand.

Early the next morning, police officers executed the search warrant by making an unannounced, forced entry into the premises by breaking through a second floor bedroom window. Police officers believed that the unusual method of executing the search warrant was necessary because burglar bars secured every door and window on the first floor, defendant had 12 dogs, and heroin was easily disposable. On appeal, defendant argued that there were no exigent circumstances that would have permitted such entry. The court agreed, holding that the fortress-like qualities of the premises, even when coupled with the probability of easily disposable heroin, did not make the entry by police officers within the standards of reasonableness required under the Fourth Amendment.

The court reversed the decision in favor of the board and held that the student's complaint was sufficient to require an appropriate response by the board and a hearing to determine whether her right to due process had been violated by procedural infirmities or substantively by the application of arbitrary grade reduction penalties that had no reasonable relationship to the disciplinary objectives sought to be attained by the board.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the mother filed a petition, alleging that the father had not paid the support as ordered. She waived all claims to alimony and requested that a judgment be entered holding the father responsible for child support only from the entry of the divorce decree until her 21st birthday, which had occurred. The judgment was entered. The daughter, as administratrix of her mother's estate, sought to recover from the estate of her father the amount of support that had not been paid to the mother. She claimed support until the death of her mother. The trial court granted the father's executor leave to appear specially and dismissed the action. The court held that the mother's waiver, request for child support through the end of the child's minority, and the resulting judgment conclusively determined the extent of any monetary obligation the father owed under the divorce decree. Any subsequent attempt to relitigate that issue was barred. The court made no finding as to how the daughter could enforce that judgment, but ruled that the petition she brought was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school district challenged the decision of the Circuit Court of Will County (Illinois), which dismissed, for lack of jurisdiction, its action for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants, the state superintendent of education and the state comptroller. The district sought to preclude defendants from withholding state aid from it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district was conducting a full-year school program under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 10-19.1 (1975). The district was notified by the state department of education that a substantial amount in state assistance would be withheld from the district in 1977-78 because it had not held school for 180 days in each of the school years 1973-74 and 1974-75. The district brought an injunctive action against defendants, alleging that their actions were illegal because Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, par. 10-19.1 (1975) provided for a special framework applicable to all-year schools and that the district had complied with such provisions. It also alleged that it did conduct school for 180 days in the years in question. A preliminary injunction was issued, and defendants answered, asserting immunity from suit. The trial court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction, and the district appealed. The court reversed, holding that where the suit charged that an officer of the state acted unconstitutionally, illegally, or without lawful authority, the conduct was deemed not to be that of the state, and the doctrine of sovereign immunity was not applicable. Thus, the trial court had jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The State filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State asserted that because defendant failed to file any post-trial motion, written or oral, he had waived consideration of all the errors he raised. The court noted that Illinois courts had long required some form of post-trial review in the trial court in order to preserve allegations of error for the purposes of appeal. Generally, the failure to raise an issue in a motion for a new trial constituted a waiver of that issue and defendant could not then assert such as a ground for reversal on appeal. However, exceptions to the application of the waiver rule had been made with regard to allegations of the insufficiency of the evidence that could have been raised for the first time on appeal. The court held that two of defendant's assertions went to the sufficiency of the evidence and therefore the waiver rule did not apply. However, the court did not find merit in either of defendant's contentions and concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The advocates sought to establish a right to possess and use cannabis in the home. On appeal, the advocates argued that the constitutional right of privacy protected the private use and possession of cannabis. The court affirmed the dismissal, holding that neither the United States Constitution nor the Illinois Constitution protected the private use and possession of cannabis. The court also held that the Act was constitutional because the legislature clearly had a rational basis for finding societal harm arising from the private use and possession of the drug. Because the Act was supported by scientific evidence, even though disputed by other studies, the Act had a rational basis and should have been upheld. The court further held that the trial court could have properly taken judicial notice of the harmfulness of cannabis because studies indicated such harmful effects as genetic damage, reduction in fertility, and even sterility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After filing his complaint, the taxpayer failed to comply with the requirement of Ill Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 451 (1975) that it either file a bond or cause the circuit court to impress a lien upon its property in lieu of bond. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that the 20-day time requirement in para. 451 for filing a bond referred only to the time period within which the taxpayer could file a bond. If the time requirement also applied to the period in which the court could impress a lien in lieu of bond, the taxpayer asserted that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 451 (1975) was unconstitutionally vague and, therefore, deprived the taxpayer of its property without due process. The court held that para. 451 was neither unconstitutionally vague, nor violative of due process. The taxpayer's argument that the action of the department in seizing all of the taxpayer's assets made it impossible for the taxpayer to obtain a bond was not persuasive. The trial court could have imposed a lien on any property the taxpayer might have acquired in the future if the taxpayer had acted within the time limit established by the statute.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1312(d) (1975), was unconstitutionally vague. The court stated that a law failed to meet the requirements of due process if it was so vague and standardless that it left the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibited or left judges and jurors free to decide, without any legally fixed standards, what is or was not prohibited in any given case. The court stated that no numerical definition of &quot;small quantities&quot; was expressed in the statute. A &quot;small quantity&quot; could vary from one controlled substance to another, particularly in relation to potency, manufacturer's form, and dosage application. In this respect, a high degree of subjectivity and uncertainty was involved in a practitioner's determination of whether dispersing records were necessary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner public service company appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Macoupin County (Illinois), which awarded damages to respondent property owners in the company's eminent domain proceeding. The property owners cross-appealed, alleging that the company should not occupy their property during the pendency of the company's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company brought a condemnation action in order to gain property on which to install new power lines. One witness, in describing damages beyond the required easement, calculated the replacement cost of a house in addition to the land on which it was situated. The jury accepted this and returned a verdict of $ 17,500 for damage to the property outside the easement strip. The company appealed, and the court reversed and remanded on this point. The court found that the house could not be valued separately from the land; instead, the improved value of the land as a whole had to be calculated. On the cross-appeal, the court found that &sect; 13 of the Eminent Domain Act did apply to cases where the condemnor had initiated the appeal. Thus, a bond would sufficiently protect the property owners during the course of the appeal and the company's occupation of the land. Consequently, the court affirmed the remainder of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a village and its officials, appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found certain sections of a village ordinance void and inapplicable as applied to plaintiff amusement center operator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance severely restricted the use of coin-operated amusement devices. The trial court found that portions of the ordinance bore no reasonable relation to the health, safety, or general welfare of the people of the village, and were therefore void as applied to the operator. On appeal, the court reversed, because the operator's liberty and property rights in the premises it leased were superseded by the valid exercise of police power to regulate the public safety. The removal of coin-operated amusement devices from a statutory list of gambling devices did not by implication repeal Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-42-2 (1977), which provided for municipal regulation over certain amusements, because gambling was not the only concern, and because repeal by implication occurred only when reconciliation was impossible. The court noted that the ordinances were clothed with presumptive validity which could only be rebutted by clear and affirmative evidence that their adoption was arbitrary or capricious. While the evidence was conflicting, the village had offered testimony tending to prove that the use of coin-operated amusement devices led to increased juvenile crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court, which held that the ordinances were void and inapplicable as applied to the operator.</SPAN></P>

The Board recommended revocation, and the Director accepted the Board's findings. The circuit court affirmed, but stayed the revocation pending the outcome of the physician's appeal. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The Act clearly stated that revocation in a sister state was grounds for revocation by the Director. Failure of the sister state to observe technical rules in its revocation proceeding did not materially affect the physician's rights or result in a substantial injustice. The court did find a conflict between provisions in the Administrative Review Act and the Act regarding whether the revocation imposed by the Director could be stayed pending appeal. The Act prevailed, and the circuit court's order staying revocation of the physician's license pending appeal was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 2. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the city, in the exercise of its police powers, had the authority to enact the amendment and to make it applicable to existing buildings. The amended ordinance did not effect a taking of private property without due process or just compensation because it was reasonably related to and tended to accomplish its purpose, which was to prevent deaths from fires in nursing homes. It also did not violate federal and state constitutional equal protection clauses because the classification of nursing homes was reasonably and fairly related to its purpose and did not invidiously or arbitrarily discriminate against nursing homes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a party at which defendant was intoxicated, he took a loaded gun onto a crowded back porch, where the victim was sitting on the railing.

On appeal, he contended that his guilt was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The court affirmed his conviction. Under para. 9 -- 3(a), a defendant was guilty of involuntary manslaughter if his acts were likely to cause death or great bodily harm, and the acts were performed recklessly. It had been held that carrying a loaded gun into a crowded space, particularly when one was intoxicated, was sufficient to support a finding of recklessness as contemplated by para. 9 -- 3(a). The trial court's statement that the incident may or may not have been an accident was not evidence that the trial court was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of defendant's guilt, particularly in light of the judge's other comments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustees, as individuals, along with a corporation, a bank, and the trustees entered into a voting trust agreement to assure that the stock of the bank, which formed the trust res, would be voted in accordance with the wishes of the trustees. Stock dividends paid by the bank were to be paid to the trustees, who in turn were required to distribute the dividends to the individual owners of the trust certificates. The State sued the trustees to recover personal property taxes, and the actions were consolidated. The trial court entered judgment against defendants, and they appealed, contending that they were exempt from the personal property tax because they held the stock in question as individuals. In affirming, the court noted a distinction regarding the imposition of personal property taxes upon property held in a fiduciary relationship that was created involuntarily and by operation of law and a voluntary fiduciary relationship. The court held that the voting trust did not come into being by operation of law. Rather, the parties to the agreement intentionally and voluntarily created it. Consequently, the trial court properly imposed personal property taxes on the trustees.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, he moved to withdraw his guilty plea contending that the trial court failed to follow the new sentencing procedures. The trial court denied the motion. The court affirmed the sentence. The trial court, at the time of imposing sentence, had before it sufficient presentence information. In determining the sentence, the trial court was not bound by the usual rules of evidence but was allowed to search anywhere within reasonable bounds for facts which tended to aggravate or mitigate the offense. Moreover, defendant's history of prior delinquency or criminal activity was a factor for consideration in aggravation. Thus, there was no error in including information in the presentence report and allowing testimony at the sentencing hearing regarding defendant's alleged prior sexual contact with the complaining witness and other children for which he had not been charged.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that a party's property was properly invaded upon a grant of divorce for the purpose of recognizing special equities in the property or to award alimony in gross. The court ruled that the trial court properly applied the new Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 101 et seq. (1977), and the wife was not deprived of due process. The court held that the trial court properly found that there was a repayment by the husband of the cost of the land. The court found that the wife made no objection when the husband's counsel made reference to repayment in his opening statement and when evidence of repayment was received. Further, the court found that the trial court properly awarded the wife maintenance to pursue her education.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, village and residents (petitioners), sought review of an order of the Illinois Pollution Control Board (board), which denied their request to withdraw their complaint and dismissed it with prejudice. Petitioners sought revocation of permits issued by respondent, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, to respondent waste management corporation for development and operation of a sanitary landfill site adjacent to the village.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed a complaint with the board for revocation of permits issued by the agency for development of a landfill. Petitioners then requested to withdraw the complaint with leave to reinstate it or, alternatively, to continue the matter. The board denied the request, dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and stated it did not favor forum shopping and that the hearing process for dismissal did not require an actual adjudicatory hearing. Petitioners appealed, and the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the board abused its discretion by arbitrarily depriving petitioners of the hearing to which they were entitled under the board's Procedural Rule 503. The alleged forum shopping was petitioners' challenges to the constitutionality of the procedures for issuance of landfill permits. Petitioners were entitled to have sought such injunctive and judicial relief. Also, the allegation of undue delay was not a valid ground for dismissal. Under &sect; 52 of the Civil Procedure Act, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 110, para. 52 (1975), the agency had no more discretion to refuse petitioners' motion for voluntary dismissal than would a court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the board, which dismissed petitioners' complaint, which sought revocation of a landfill permit, with prejudice and denied petitioners' motion to withdraw their complaint without prejudice. The court remanded to the board for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hospital petitioned for leave to appeal a certified question after the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied its motion to dismiss plaintiff administrator's medical malpractice action. The hospital filed a collection action for unpaid services to plaintiff's decedent. Counter-plaintiff filed a counterclaim alleging that the collection action was wrongfully brought. The collection and malpractice actions were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital's motion to dismiss claimed that the administrator's malpractice action was time-barred by the Wrongful Death Act's two-year filing period under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 70, &sect; 2 (1975). The circuit court denied the motion. It found that the action was brought properly under &sect; 17 of the Limitations Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 18 (1975), because of the pendency of the counter-plaintiff 's counterclaim in the collection action. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 17 did not rescue the administrator's malpractice action because the filing of a counterclaim in an action unrelated to the allegations in a later, independent action did not toll the running of the statute of limitations on the later action. The administrator also claimed that &sect; 21.1 of the Limitations Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 21.1 (1975), superseded the two-year limitation period of the Wrongful Death Act in actions alleging malpractice. On appeal, the court disagreed because under &sect; 21.1, the date of the claimant's knowledge of the death commenced the running of the statute. The court reversed the order of the circuit court denying the hospital's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate filed a wrongful death suit against the hospital related to the decedent's care. The hospital filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action was not brought within two years of the date of the death, as required by the Wrongful Death Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 70, para. 2(c) (1975). The estate argued that it was not advised of the actual cause of death until a later date and that it had acted within the limitations period. The trial court granted the hospital's motion to dismiss. The estate appealed, alleging that the discovery rule applied to an action for wrongful death. The court determined that, under the Limitations Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 22.1 (1971), the discovery rule applied to a medical malpractice action. The court held that the discovery rule applied to the case because although the date of death was known and did not have to be discovered, the negligence behind the death was not discovered until sometime after the date of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The film company created a film with the subject matter of making a pornographic movie. The film company applied for a permit to exhibit the film in the city to general audiences. The city's rating system provided for permits to allow viewing by all audiences or only by those over the age of 18. The film was viewed by the police department, which refused the permit. The film company appealed to the board, which screened the film and conducted a hearing at which evidence was introduced by both parties. The board affirmed the denial of a permit to show the film to anyone under the age of 18 years of age and, pursuant to &sect; 7.2, filed a complaint for an injunction. The trial court reviewed the matter, including the film, de novo and granted the injunction. The court held that the city's ordinance met due process requirements through its stringent requirements of review, placing the burden on the board at all stages of the proceedings to establish the reasons for denying a permit. The board met its burden of establishing that the film was obscene with respect to children and that a general permit should not have been issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff handicapped student appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that dismissed the student's complaint seeking a declaration that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 14-7.02 (1977) was unconstitutional in that it limited the amount of tuition which the state, through its school districts, must pay for the special education of handicapped student who were excluded from public schools and received a private education.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint also sought injunctive relief that mandated the school districts to pay the full tuition of all handicapped public school students attending private schools. Following the handicapped child's exclusion from the public schools, his mother was required to pay the difference between the tuition charged by the private school and the amount contributed by defendant Board of Education of the City of Chicago (board). The court reasoned that the state constitution, Ill. Const. art. X, &sect; 1 (1970), established the right of handicapped persons to tuition-free education through the secondary level. Parents and guardians were not required to pay tuition for the education of their handicapped child. No discretion was left with the legislature to deny free education to the public or to require any state resident to pay for schooling through the secondary level. Thus, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 14-7.02 (1977) violated the provisions of the education article of the state constitution when it deprived the handicapped student of a tuition-free education. The court reversed and remanded the case on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Landowners filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the village, seeking to declare various ordinances of the village unconstitutional, invalid, and void.

The trial court granted partial summary judgment for the village pursuant to &sect; 57 of the Civil Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 57 (1975). At the close of the landowners' case, the trial court entered judgment for the village. The landowners contended that the trial court erred in granting partial summary judgment in favor of the village because the local ordinance was not validly enacted. The court found the issue moot because the ordinance did not apply to the case. The landowners also contended that there was a conspiracy between the developer and the village to choose the developer as the successful bidder of the subject property.

The totality of circumstances shows that defendant made a voluntary and knowing consent to the search, thus, the search was legal and the evidence obtained was admissible.

On appeal, the court held that the trial court's failure to give an instruction on defendant's intent was harmless error because the evidence supported a finding that defendant had the requisite intent. Regarding the issue of effective assistance, the court found that there was no conflict of interest between defendants that resulted in a denial of effective assistance of counsel. The court found that defendant was not tried with his co-defendant and that no representations of conflict of interest were ever raised.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After their indictment, defendants chose to wait for a state supreme court decision before proceeding to trial. At trial, one attorney represented both defendants. A chemist testified that the substance defendants were selling was amphetamines, based on his testing of one percent of the pills. Defendants were convicted. The wife filed a supplemental brief alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that defendants were not denied the right to a speedy trial because they acquiesced in the delay between indictment and trial. The court determined that the chemist's opinion was properly admitted and that it was for the jury to determine the weight to be given the expert opinion in light of the methods by which it was reached. The court determined that the wife's right to effective representation was not violated by the joint representation of her and the husband. The court noted that the defense strategy was clearly to argue that the husband should take the blame in the hope that the jury would exonerate the wife. The court held that the trial court did not have a duty to ask defendants if they wanted or needed separate counsel.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, she contended that the valuation provision of the retail theft act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 16A-2.2 (1975), was unconstitutional because it constituted special legislation. The court rejected this argument, stating that the valuation provision of the retail theft act was not special legislation, but was in fact a clarification of the theft statute with reference to retail items. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in admitting the merchandise into evidence because the chain of custody was not established and also because the witnesses did not specifically identify the price tags as being unchanged from the time of the offense. The prosecution did not have to prove the chain of custody because the items were identified by the security officers when they testified. The witnesses were not required to testify that the price tags were substantially unchanged because the price tags were attached to the exhibit at the inventory as well as at trial. Defendant's retail theft conviction was upheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three defendants, two brothers and their co-defendant, challenged an order from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found them all guilty of aggravated battery causing great bodily harm. All defendants claimed error in a refusal to give a requested instruction and the imposition of a prison sentence instead of a probation term. The brothers also asserted a conflict in a joint representation by their retained counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The brothers and their codefendant contended that the trial court erred in holding that &sect; 115-4(f) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-4(f) (1975), was unconstitutional and in conflict with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 234, which related to voir dire. The court held that this ruling was correct because the statute had been declared void. The court also held that each defendant was accountable for the criminal acts of all because they were all positively identified as participants in the beating. Further, the trial court fully and properly instructed the jury on the law of accountability, and defendants could not complain where they failed to tender their own instruction. Moreover, the court rejected the brothers' conflict of interest argument based on their unequal culpability in the aggravated battery. A joint representation by their privately retained counsel did not create a conflict where one brother admitted to striking the final, most serious blow because it actually benefited the other less culpable brother. Finally, the prison sentences imposed by the trial court were appropriate based on defendants' attitudes and the seriousness of the attack.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed on appeal, and concluded that defendant was not entitled to a new trial.

After the brother advised the police of a good hiding spot in the house, the police conducted the search out of concern that the victim may still have been alive. The brother had the capacity and authority to consent to the search, and his consent had been given voluntarily. The evidence supported the trial court's finding that defendant was sane at the time of the murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The IBI was investigating alleged payoffs from tavern owners to city officials. Defendant was charged with bribery, intimidation, official misconduct, and conspiracy to permit gambling as a result of his conversations with an IBI agent that were tape recorded with the agent's consent. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the tape recordings because of noncompliance with the eavesdropping statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 14-2(a) (1975). The trial court also ordered the suppression of testimony concerning the conversations. On appeal, the court reversed. The statute did not require a written request specifically naming defendant or a request that originated with the state's attorney's office. One of the parties to the conversation consented to the taping and the state's attorney authorized the eavesdropping. The exception of &sect; 14-2(a) was established and the recording should have been admitted. The agent's testimony about the conversations was admissible even if the tape recordings were properly suppressed.

At issue was the constitutionality of the Illinois Income Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 1-101 et seq. (1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation deducted a valuation limitation amount from its federal taxable income in arriving at its net income for Illinois tax purposes. The Department disallowed the deduction on the ground that a corporate taxpayer was not entitled to it. The corporation paid the tax claimed as due under protest and sued for a refund. The trial court dismissed the suit. The corporation argued that the Act violated Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 3(a) (1970) by allowing individuals certain deductions not available to corporations and that the Act violated the Illinois Constitution to the extent that it taxed depreciation which was not allowed as a deduction, so that the tax was not measured by income. The court stated that Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 (1970) recognized that there would be differences in the deductions granted to various classes of taxpayers and merely imposed a requirement of reasonableness on these deductions. Any variance that existed in the case was extremely limited in its application. A tax on appreciation occurring prior to the effective date of a taxing act, but not realized until after that date, was a tax on income within the authority granted by Ill. Const. art. IX (1970).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to murder. He had made three statements to the police about the occurrence of the murder prior to the entry of his plea, and another statement during sentencing. All four statements were substantially different and implicated defendant in varying degrees. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in accepting his plea without an adequate showing of a factual basis and by requiring him to carry the burden of proving his lack of fitness to stand trial when a hearing was held on that issue. The court disagreed and affirmed his conviction. The court noted that the mental state for the murder charged was intent. Defendant's claim that he was intoxicated was first made at sentencing, long after the plea was accepted. And, the trial court was not required to accept defendant's motion to withdrawal his plea merely because he stated a defense for the first time at sentencing. Especially in light of the fact that his testimony in support of that defense could be impeached by his prior statements. The court also held that because the only evidence on defendant's competency proved that he was fit to stand trial, a directed verdict of fitness was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Proceedings were initiated by the local liquor control commissioner to revoke the retail liquor license of the tavern owner. He was found guilty of committing two aggravated batteries upon patrons, through an agent, and of being in possession of an unregistered weapon. On appeal, the tavern owner contended that the Dramshop Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 43, para. 153 (1977) created an unconstitutional classification by providing different procedures based on population for reviewing revocation orders of local liquor control commissioners. Section 8 of article VII of the Act provided that appeals from all orders of local liquor control commissioners in municipalities of 500,000 or more were to be determined by the License Appeal Commission. The court held that the classification based on population was not arbitrary or discriminatory. De novo reviews in densely populated municipalities would be unreasonable. The tavern owner also urged that the commissioner's decision was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. The court found that the commissioner's decision was supported by substantial competent evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant inflicted extensive physical injuries upon her child by striking the child with a wooden switch. The court concluded that such conduct was clearly proscribed by the statute and the court would not consider the statute's application to other borderline circumstances, which might be advanced theoretically. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence presented to allow the trial court to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

The State maintained that the term was simply misspelled and, alternatively, that the substance was controlled by virtue of &sect; 201(d) of the Act, Ill. Rev.

The trial court dismissed the counts of the indictment concerning &quot;phendimetrazine.&quot; On appeal the court concluded that the counts of the indictments charging defendant with possessing and illegally dispensing phendimetrazine did state an offense under &sect; 208(b)(6). The court found that the intent of the legislature was to ban phendimetrazine and, through some legislative oversight, the technical term, contained in the statute along with many other technical terms, was simply misspelled.

Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and rape. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, finding that upon defendant's request for an attorney, all questioning should have ceased.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a decision of the Circuit Court of Warren County (Illinois), which entered an order suppressing all handguns seized, except the handgun identified by serial number, during the execution of a search warrant at defendant's apartment. Defendant cross appealed seeking the suppression the handgun identified by serial number on grounds that it was unlawfully seized as part of an unreasonable search of defendant's premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While posing as a buyer, an officer obtained the serial number of one of many handguns in defendant's possession, which defendant admitted were all probably stolen. The serial number later revealed that the gun and many others were stolen from a gun shop, on which basis a search warrant was obtained for the seizure of the identified handgun and &quot;any other handguns which may be stolen.&quot; Defendant contended that the failure to particularize the items to be seized converted the search into a general one. The court held that the generic description in this case was sufficient to comply with the Fourth Amendment. The court further held that a general description was permissible for items requiring some discernment, and even after-the-fact testing, but having at bottom, an objective basis for recognition. The court reasoned that the &quot;stolen guns&quot; in this case were easily verifiable as such by the officer's list of stolen guns. The court concluded that when the circumstances make an exact description of items impossible, the officer could only be expected to describe the generic class of items to be seized.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the judgment refusing to suppress the identified handgun, reversed that part of the judgment that suppressed the other handguns, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer brought an action pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 102, paras. 11-16 (1975), to restrain and enjoin the disbursement of public moneys by defendants. The trial court denied the taxpayer leave to file a first amended complaint. On appeal, the court stated that the sole issue on appeal was whether the trial court erred in denying the taxpayer's request to file his proposed amended complaint. The taxpayer's basic contention was that the trial court should have granted leave to file because the request was neither frivolous nor malicious. The court held that the taxpayer's arguments constituted an impermissible collateral attack on the constitutionality and propriety of existing differences in inter-county uniformity of assessments. The Supreme Court of Illinois had upheld such assessments.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant federally-chartered savings and loan associations sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which affirmed decisions of appellees, the Illinois Savings and Loan Board and the Commissioner of Savings and Loan Associations, permitting state-chartered savings and loan associations to compete in appellants' respective market areas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board allowed five state-charted associations to compete in the same market areas covered by the federally-charted associations. That action was affirmed in the circuit court. The court affirmed in four of the cases, but reversed and remanded the fifth case. The statutes in question permissibly granted discretion to the Commissioner to make decisions regarding the relocation of state-chartered savings and loan associations. The criteria for establishment of a facility requiring that &quot;a need exist&quot; and &quot;undue injury not occur&quot; were set forth in the statute pertaining to establishment or relocation of an association, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 32, paras. 724, 744(h) (1975). The federally-charted associations asserted that these criteria for establishment of a facility were vague and uncertain and did not constitute controlling standards to be applied by the Commissioner. But the court held that these concepts were legislatively recognized as not subject to precise definition. The criteria were established in the four cases that were affirmed but not in the fifth case, which was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted in the Circuit Court of Kankakee County (Illinois) for forgery and theft by deception. The trial court denied defendant's motion for mistrial on the ground that the state failed to fulfill the requirements under &sect; 2-7 of the Juvenile Court Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 702-7 (1975) for prosecution of a minor. Defendant was convicted as charged. She appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 17 years old at the time of alleged offense. The criminal indictment was suppressed and a capias was issued but not returned until nearly three years later. The cause did not proceed to trial until an additional eight months. The total delay between indictment and arrest was 33 months. The trial court denied the mistrial motion on the ground that the Illinois Supreme Court's ruling that &sect; 2-7 did not apply to 17 years did apply retroactively to allegations against defendant. The court reversed and held that the trial court erred by refusing to grant a mistrial. The state was required to have first filed a petition with the juvenile court alleging the offenses committed before the state had discretion as to which court the minor could have been tried in. Because the supreme court's ruling affected substantive rights under a procedural statute, the ruling could not have applied retroactively. Second, although defendant failed to assert in a post-trial motion alleging denial of her speedy trial rights, violation of that right was plain error. The state conceded the delay was caused by its incompetence. The delay was exceedingly long and prejudiced defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for mistrial and reversed defendant's convictions for fraud and theft by deception. The court dismissed the indictment.</SPAN></P>

The former wife obtained various orders reducing arrearages and temporary support payments against her husband.

The former wife then brought an action in Illinois seeking to hold her former husband in contempt and further reduce arrearages owed by former husband. For the first time, the former husband attempted to contest the matter in Illinois through entering a special appearance. Illinois granted the former wife's action, and the former husband appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) even though the wife failed to allege that jurisdictional acts forming the basis for divorce had occurred in Illinois, the defect was not fatal; (2) alleged condonation of acts of cruelty forming the basis for divorce did not deprive the court of jurisdiction; and (3) there was no error in the court's refusal to act on issues of setoff against the judgment on arrearages and temporary support that were pending before an out-of-state court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an ordinance was declared unconstitutional, the violator who had paid a fine to the city sought a refund. In reversing an order which dismissed the complaint because it was not timely filed, the court held that the case did not involve a criminal conviction, as ordinance violations were &quot;quasi-criminal,&quot; nor was it an attempt to collaterally attack judgments based on constitutional error. The city's prosecution of its ordinance was not a criminal prosecution under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 1-2-1.1 (1975), but was an action for debt, and a void judgment could be attacked at any time. The court held that it was highly fictitious to say that one charged with violating an ordinance should later be precluded from recovering fine money paid under the void ordinance simply because he &quot;voluntarily&quot; paid it. On remand, the violator could ask the trial court to declare the ordinance unconstitutional as alternatively prayed in its original motion, or could attempt to use the prior judgment of unconstitutionality as collateral estoppel against the city.</SPAN></P>

The trial court again found defendant unfit to stand trial. He was remanded to the sheriff pending his release on bail. The defendant filed another petition for review of competency and another hearing was held. The trial court found defendant fit for trial and convicted him. The court affirmed on appeal. The court found that defendant could be made to carry the burden of proof for proving his own fitness, once he had been found unfit. The court noted that this applied only to the 1973 version of Ill.

Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 132.10-1 (1977) was unconstitutional on the grounds that it deprived him of his right to due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor was the sole bidder on the Department's contract for the manufacture of license plates. The Department rejected the contractor's bid based on the Act, which stated that no person or business entity was to be awarded a contract if that entity or person had been convicted of bribery or attempting to bribe a State officer on behalf of such entity. The Department had determined that the contractor, in his capacity as an official for a predecessor corporation, had pled guilty to a charge of robbery of a State official. The contractor sought declaratory and injunctive relief, asserting that the Act found him guilty of bribery without providing any due process such as notice of the charge or a right to review the decision. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by granting the Department's motion for summary judgment. The court determined that although the contractor did not have a &quot;right&quot; to do business with the State, debarring him from any opportunity to contract with the State was a protectable interest under State and federal due process guaranties. The court concluded that the Act, by not providing some procedural safeguards, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 38, para. 8-4(c)(3), 1005-8-1(b)(4), (c)(4), which was in effect from January 1, 1973, until October 1, 1973, classified attempt armed robbery as a Class three felony for which the maximum term was three years four months to 10 years. Defendant contended that he erroneously elected sentencing pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 8-4 (1971), under the mistaken belief that attempt armed robbery was a Class two felony. On appeal, the court vacated the sentence. The court ruled that fundamental fairness dictated that defendant should have been sentenced under the Unified Code of Corrections as initially enacted. Further, the court found that because the record did not establish with certainty the sentence defendant was serving at the time his probation was revoked, the court could not determine the effect of a consecutive sentence. The court ruled that in order to impose a consecutive sentence, the trial court must find that such a sentence was required to protect the public from further criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

The owners argued that the trial court erred in interpreting a village ordinance under which the charges were imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners were managers and owners of multifamily residential structures in the village. Charges for sewer service were provided in the village ordinance, which stated that single family units were to be charged a fixed sum, whereas multi-family structures were to be charged either the fixed sum, or 75 percent of the monthly water bill, whichever was greater. The multi-unit buildings did not have individual meters. The owners argued that the ordinance showed a clear legislative intent to determine sewer fees by reference to structures as entities and not by reference to individual users within those structures. The trial court interpreted the ordinance to mean that the charge was the greater of the fixed sum multiplied by the number of individual units within the structure, or 75 percent of the water bill for the entire structure. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly interpreted the village's ordinance. The court, interpreting the village's ordinances as a whole, determined that the terms used showed a clear intent to treat multifamily structures as collections of individual units rather than single entities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation sought to obtain a permit to establish a hospital, and the circuit court entered an order reversing the Department's denial, ordering them to issue a permit nunc pro tunc. On appeal, the court upheld the order reversing the Department's denial because the refusal of the Department to apply its modified rule 1-1.4(a) to the corporation under which the corporation would have qualified for a permit was arbitrary; however, that part of the order the required the issuance of a permit nunc pro tunc was reversed because there was no omission or misprision to correct. Thus, the court also reversed that part of the judgment that held that the corporation did not fall under the Act. Also, the court held that the corporation did not need to exhaust its administrative remedies prior to filing its suit because it was attacking an administrative rule on its face. Finally, the corporation filed a motion to dismiss the Department's appeal on the grounds that the Department waived its appeal by issuing the permit the corporation sought, and the court denied that motion because the permit had only been issued under compulsion of judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for robbery for a purse-snatching incident in which the victim testified that the defendant may have wielded a knife during the incident.

Further, the court held that the trial court did not commit error in refusing to allow the defendant's counsel to conduct direct examination of prospective jurors. The Supreme Court rule, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110A, para. 234, superseded a conflicting statute that had been found unconstitutional. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient to prove defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; the testimony of the victim was sufficient to contradict the alibi of the defendant.

Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 22.1 (1975). The wife argued that &sect; 21.1 constituted special legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased patient entered the hospital in 1965 for a right thigh muscle biopsy, which resulted in an erroneous diagnosis of the decedent's condition. The complaint alleged that as a result of defendants' acts, the patient developed steroid myopathy and suffered the amputation of both legs, and had to undergo corrective surgery for the removal of cataracts. Defendants' alleged errors were first discovered in 1976. The complaint was later amended when the patient died in 1977 allegedly due to defendants' negligence. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to the Limitations Act &sect; 21.1, which provided that no action for damages for injury or death against any physician or hospital could be brought more than four years after the date on which occurred the act or omission or occurrence alleged to have been the cause of such injury or death. Reversing and remanding the matter, the court found that &sect; 21.1, which granted immunity for hospitals and physicians while denying immunity for other members of the health care profession was clearly a special privilege in violation of Ill.

Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 2368 (1975). Defendant claimed that the State was required to allege that the injury to the child was inflicted &quot;unnecessarily.&quot; Affirming, the court noted that the Criminal Code made the offense of cruelty to children by means of injury a viable and definitely stated offense even if the adverb &quot;wilfully&quot; did not modify the verb &quot;injure.&quot; By the terms of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 4-3(b), when no mental state was set forth in a statute defining an offense, the mental state of either intent, or knowledge, or recklessness was applicable.

He also filed a petition for rehearing after the court dismissed his appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department notified the broker that it was seeking to suspend his license after it had received complaints that the broker owned and operated several buildings in violation of the city's building code. He then filed an action for a declaration that the department's regulations were unconstitutional and for a stay of any proceeding to revoke his license. The broker did not appear at a scheduled revocation hearing and his license was revoked. The trial court dismissed the broker's action based on his failure to pursue his administrative remedies. The department notified the broker of its decision to revoke his license and the broker did not appeal to the director for a rehearing as he could have. On appeal, the court held that the subsequent revocation of the broker's license by the department had rendered his action moot because the court was no longer able to render any effective relief to the broker. The court determined that the broker could have sought judicial review of the department's administrative decision, however, he failed to do so, thus, the revocation became a final, nonappealable order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant saw a police squad car, he stopped and dropped a loaded pistol. The trial court convicted defendant, a recent probationer, of the unlawful use of weapons within 5 years of conviction for a felony. Defendant raised for the first time on appeal the constitutionality of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 24-1(a)(10) (1975). The court found that defendant's failure to raise the constitutional issue at trial did not bar its presentation on appeal because the right not to be convicted under a statute whose constitutionality was questioned was a substantial right deserving of special notice by an appellate court. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 24-1(a)(10) (1975) did not contravene the right-to-arms clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 (1970), but merely regulated their use and sets out numerous exceptions that, taken together, could not have been construed as a total prohibition against such use. The court found that the restrictions imposed by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 24-1(a)(10) (1975) were a reasonable and necessary exercise of the State's police power as provided in Ill. Const. art.

The trial court certified the class and ordered the refund.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions for disorderly conduct. The court found that defendant's conviction under count I had to be reversed because the Illinois Supreme Court had declared unconstitutional the statute under which defendant was convicted, Ill.

The court upheld defendant's conviction for disorderly conduct under count II. Defendant was not denied a fair trial by the admission of evidence of other offenses. With regard to count II, the court held that defendant was not denied a fair trial by the State's introduction of prejudicial evidence of other offenses. The court concluded that the evidence of other contacts by defendant with the complainant and his family was not unduly prejudicial and was probative to circumstantiate defendant's intent and the unreasonableness and fractious nature of defendant's conduct. Even assuming that the admission of the evidence was erroneous, such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The detainees were arrested and charged with soliciting prostitution, the trial court set bound, and the police refused to accept it when tendered by the detainees. In reversing the order and remanding for further proceedings, the court held that the case was justiciable under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 57.1 (1975), because it was capable of repetition yet evading review. The court next held that the word &quot;may,&quot; as used in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 110-9, meant &quot;shall,&quot; and that the police had no discretion to refuse the bail tendered by the detainees. The court came to this conclusion by considering the context of the use of the word &quot;may,&quot; and by noting that permitting the police to refuse bail. Or to accept it only on written order from a judge, would render the Illinois Supreme Court powerless to set bail for misdemeanants by rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of heroin and possession of cannabis. The trial court granted defendant's motion to quash a search warrant and to suppress evidence seized in its execution. The trial court found that the search warrant was invalid because the time of issuance noted on it was subsequent to its execution. The trial court also granted defendant's motion for a directed verdict of not guilty at the close of the State's case as to both counts of the indictment. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in declining to consider evidence of an error in noting the time of its issuance on the search warrant. It was apparent from the record that the trial court was of the impression that it could not look beyond the four corners of the warrant in order to determine if it had been issued before the search. The court further found that the trial court erred in failing to terminate the trial and in refusing to permit the State to file its notice of appeal from the order quashing the warrant and suppressing the evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of violating the ordinance in cases involving the sale or offering for sale of nine different magazines. They argued that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to allow them to take discovery as to what parts of the magazines were asserted to be obscene, that the ordinance was unconstitutional, and that the magazines were protected by the First Amendment. The court observed that Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 210(h), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110A, para. 201(h) (1975) provided that in suits for violation of municipal ordinances where the penalty was a fine only no discovery method could be used except by leave of court. Defendants never made a record of what the possible penalties were, so the court had to presume that the authorized penalty was a fine only and that Rule 201(h) applied. The ordinance was not overbroad. It was plain from the ordinance's use of the wording of Miller that the City recognized the limitations on the kinds of representations or depictions of sexual activity which obscenity laws could prohibit. Eight of the magazines were not protected by the First Amendment because the constitutional requirement of lack of serious value was satisfied.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) the uncorroborated, credible testimony of the security officer who identified the specific type of gun possessed by defendant was sufficient to sustain the conviction, (2) it was proper for the trial court to take judicial notice of the fact that defendant was under the age of 18 because this fact was readily verifiable from sources of indisputable accuracy, (3) the unlawful possession of firearms statute was not unconstitutional, and (4) the trial court had jurisdiction to enter a dispositional order even though defendant was not specifically adjudicated as a &quot;ward of the court&quot; because other language describing the same status was used.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of obscenity following jury trials. They contended that the searches and seizures were impermissible, that the Illinois Obscenity Statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-20 (1975) was unconstitutional, that a jury instruction given over objection was improper, and that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing them. The court concluded that it was not necessary for the trial judge to view personally the films prior to his determination of probable cause and issuance of a warrant for the films. The court held that para. 11-20 was constitutional because it adopted explanatory examples of what constituted patently offensive descriptions or representations of ultimate sexual acts. Defendants waived the jury instruction issue. Even if they had preserved it, the trial court properly instructed the jury that the State was not required to produce expert testimony concerning whether the films were obscene. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in light of defendants' exemplary records in sentencing them to 90 days in jail and fining them because the imposition of probation would have deprecated the seriousness, nature, and extent of the crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By this appeal, the realtor sought to vacate an order of the Department of Registration and Education of the State of Illinois and its acting director, which suspended his real estate salesman license. The order, issued after a full administrative hearing, concluded that the realtor had violated the Real Estate Brokers and Salesmen License Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 114 1/2, para. 115(b) (1973), in that he had been convicted of two counts of the offense of &quot;Interference with Commerce by Threats or Violence,&quot; a felony, in the federal district court, and for which the realtor had been sentenced to serve a term of probation for three years. On appeal, the court affirmed holding that while a license suspension could be a hardship, the Real Estate Brokers and Salesmen License Act was not a penal measure, to be strictly construed against the State, but a broad statutory system, interpretation of which had to regard the State's interest in protecting the public from the effects of improper conduct by real estate salesmen.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mayor revoked a license held by appellee licensee due to assault by the licensee's employees, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-1(1975). The licensee filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) on a common law writ of certiorari a request that the trial court reverse the revocation. The trial court did reverse the revocation. The mayor sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was licensed to dispense food and maintain a public place of amusement. At the commission's hearing, two patrons of the licensee's business testified that a waitress brought to their table unordered drinks and told the patrons that if they did not pay, two men seated at the bar &quot;wouldn't like it&quot; and the two men would have &quot;bashed their heads in.&quot; But the patrons in their earlier statement to the police did not state they were threatened with physical injury. The court held that the trial court erred by ruling that the mayor's findings were contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. It was for the hearing commissioner, as the fact finder, to determine witnesses' credibility and weigh the evidence. The patron's testimony was not inconsistent with his statements to the police. Any inconsistency was for the hearing commissioner to have evaluated. The evidence proved assault under para. 12-1. The threat was an immediate one. The bouncers had the present ability to inflict a battery. The fact that the patrons paid for the drinks should they have feared a battery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's ruling, which reversed the determination of the mayor to revoke the licensee's license upon a finding of assault by the licensee's employees. The court reinstated the mayor's revocation order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant fundraisers appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) which enjoined them from future solicitations in Illinois and ordered them to pay compensatory and punitive damages in plaintiff attorney general's fraud action. Defendant charities appealed the judgment dismissing their third-party complaint against the fundraisers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general filed suit against the charities and the professional fundraisers they hired to recovery money he alleged was solicited fraudulently through the mails and to enjoin future solicitation in Illinois. The charities were accused of spending more than the statutorily allowed maximum of contributions in expenses thus leaving too little money for charitable purposes. The trial court dismissed the action against the charities, found that the fundraisers defrauded the public, enjoined them from soliciting in Illinois, and ordered them to pay compensatory and punitive damages. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The trial court erred by construing &sect; 9(c) of the Illinois solicitation act as requiring the application of 75 percent of total receipts for charitable purposes as the statute allows the deduction of costs shown to have been legitimately and reasonably incurred. The trial court also erred by awarding the attorney general punitive damages because he did not seek that relief in his complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment enjoining the fundraisers from soliciting funds in Illinois and ordering them to pay compensatory damages was affirmed, and the case was remanded to determine the amount of compensatory damages. The judgment requiring the fundraisers to pay punitive damages and the judgment against one fundraiser was reversed.</SPAN></P>
