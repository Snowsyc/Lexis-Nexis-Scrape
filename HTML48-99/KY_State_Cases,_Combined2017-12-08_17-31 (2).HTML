</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The highway commissioner sought a declaration that highway funds could be spent to print and distribute road maps, bulletins, booklets, and advertisements concerning state highways. The chancellor sustained the finance commissioner's demurrer to the petition then dismissed it. The court reversed the chancellor's dismissal and remanded with instructions to overrule the demurrer and order the finance commissioner to pay such costs out of the highway funds. The court held that printing and distributing road maps could be considered as maintenance and administration of the highway system under Ky. Const. &sect; 230. The amount of gas taxes paid by outstate tourists and travelers more than paid for the cost. The constitutional provision was to secure road funds, not to curtail the road program. The court also held that magazine advertisements were covered expenditures as well, although it was a closer call. The court held that such advertisements could be used to notify outstate drivers of road conditions. The court did not consider whether Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 146.060 and 147.050 contravened various state constitutional provisions as the question had no application to the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, attorneys who defended a first son convicted of killing his parents, sought review of a judgment of a trial court (Kentucky), in favor of second son upon his petition under Ky. Rev. Stat. 381.280, to declare void a mortgage the first son gave the attorneys for his interest in property his parents owned at the time of their deaths to secure a note for the payment of their legal services, and dismissed their answer and cross-petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first son shot and killed his parents. He was charged with their murders and hired the attorneys to defend him. He executed and delivered to them a note for their fee, secured by a mortgage on his interest in the house and lot owned by his parents at the time of their deaths. He was convicted. The second son filed a petition alleging that the mortgage was void. The attorneys claimed that it was executed before the first son's interest in the property was forfeited by his conviction and that Ky. Rev. Stat. 381.280 was unconstitutional. Their demurrer to the petition was overruled, and a demurrer to their answer and cross-petition was sustained. Their answer and cross-petition was dismissed. The court affirmed and held that the first son's acts in shooting his parents resulted in their death. By those acts he forfeited any right to inherit from them. His conviction was a judicial determination that he forfeited that right. The acts of killing them took place immediately before they died so he forfeited his right to inherit immediately before they died, and no part of their estate vested in him. Therefore, his attempt to mortgage his interest in their property was without effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court on both the appeal and the cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court declined to permit the reply to be filed, adjudged the charges against the contestant were to be taken as true, and rendered judgment dismissing the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 122.070 required that, if a reply was filed, it was to be done within 10 days after an answer; (2) Ky. Const. &sect; 151 did not deprive the legislature of the power to deprive a guilty candidate of the right to challenge his successful opponent's election on the same grounds; (3) no reasonable excuse was offered for the contestant's delay in tendering his reply, and the trial court properly rejected it; and (4) Ky.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a recount case, appellant sought review of a judgment of a Kentucky trial court, which adjudged appellee to be the winner of an election for the office of county tax commissioner over appellant by a majority of two votes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed that the absent voting statute, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 126, was unconstitutional and discriminatory because it did not provide for absentee voting by the blind, illiterate, or disabled. On appeal, the court refused to consider appellant's claim because he did not show the law's alleged deficiency prejudiced him. He failed to show that any members of the class were actually deprived of their right to vote or that they would have voted for him. Appellant also claimed that the county clerk improperly accepted absentee ballots that were prepared in his office and personally delivered to him. The court disagreed. The provision in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 126.230 that a voter would &quot;mail&quot; the ballot to the clerk was a directory, not a mandatory, requirement. The execution and delivery of the ballots in the clerk's office was an irregularity that did not authorize the disfranchisement of voters in the absence of any showing of bad faith, misconduct, or fraud. As to ballots that were marked in the circles under both parties, there was no difficulty presented in determining the intention of the voters; thus, they were properly counted under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 118.280(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City passed an ordinance in which it proposed to annex a territory. The property owners, who lived in the territory, filed an action challenging the City's authority to annex the territory. The trial court peremptorily instructed a jury to return a verdict for the City. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81.110(2) the proceeding was barred by a former judgment that was adverse to annexation. The statute provided that if a judgment of a circuit court was adverse to annexation by a city, then no further attempt to annex the same territory could be made within two years after the rendition of the judgment. Evidence showed that within two years prior to the passage of the instant ordinance, a previous judgment in a suit between the same parties had been entered denying the City annexation of an area that embraced the same territory. Therefore, any further attempt to annex the territory was stopped by operation of the statute for two years from the date of the prior judgment. There was no evidence that the instant ordinance repealed by implication the prior ordinance under which the prior annexation was attempted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The federal employee claimed that he was immune from the payment of a tax under Louisville, Ky. Ordinance &sect; 1, which imposed a tax upon the privilege of working within the City of Louisville to be paid into a sinking fund of the City. An action was filed to determine the issue, and the trial court entered a judgment against the federal employee. The federal employee appealed and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the tax imposed under the ordinance was not discriminatory. It was imposed on federal employees and employees of the state, county, city, and privately owned businesses. The doctrine of extending immunity to the salaries of employees of one government from the payment of taxes by a coexisting government had been previously overruled by the United States Supreme Court.

Specifically, the neighbor desired to have a roadway built over the tracks so that he may drive into town by this short cut. As provided by the statute, commissioners were appointed to determine the necessity for the private passway. The commissioner determined that there was a necessity. A county court jury fixed damages for the loss of the right-of-way at $ 600. A circuit court jury reduced the award to $ 100. On appeal, the court reversed the award of the passway and held that the neighbor had failed to show that this particular roadway was a practical necessity for the accomplishment of any public purposes as provided by &sect; 381.580. The court noted that the evidence showed that the neighbor had a nearby alternate route to travel into town and, that, although that route was a prescriptive easement over adjoining neighbor's property, there was no indication that the adjoining neighbor, had any intention of depriving its use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Action involving the applicability of an amendment to Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 160.500 for fees to sheriffs in counties having a population of more than 75,000. The action was instituted by appellee board of education wherein it charged that an additional three percent allowed appellant sheriff for collecting the local school taxes constituted a diversion of school funds in contravention of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 180 and 184 and was, therefore, void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior case, the court held that the amendment to Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 160.500 was not applicable to sheriffs of counties containing a population of less than 75,000 who were elected prior to the effective date of the Act. The court affirmed. According to the pleadings and the proof, a fee of one percent was amply sufficient to cover the costs of collecting the local school tax and the additional three percent amounted to an excess of up to $ 60,000 per year. It was true that &sect; 160.500 referred to the allowance made a sheriff for the collection of local school taxes as a fee, but there was a marked difference between a fee in its true concept and a tax. The court found that no violence was done to Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 180 or 184 when a reasonable charge was made against a local school tax for its collection. However, the express mandates of those sections could not be overlooked when a school tax was under consideration because under them a tax could not be levied for school purposes and then used for other purposes. The additional three percent allowed the sheriff resulted in a diversion to purposes other than school purposes.</SPAN></P>

In the primary election, the contestant received 2,481, and the contestee received 4,407 votes. The petition charged, inter alia, that the contestee forfeited his right to be a candidate in the Republican primary when he filed as a candidate in the Democratic primary under the Non-Partisan Judicial Act, Kr.

The court held that the statute had been held constitutional in a prior Kentucky Supreme Court case and that the contestant's claim that it was unconstitutional was properly stricken from his petition. The court further held that all of the petition should have been stricken or the contestee's demurrer sustained to it since what could be regarded as material did not constitute a cause of action and that, in any event, there was no evidence to sustain the charges.</SPAN></P>

The new section made it a felony for a parent of a child under 16 years of age to abandon the child or not comply with the divorce order for child support or custody, or to take away the child when the parent did not have custody. The General Assembly intended to amend the title and the statute. Under Ky.

The courts presumed that a statute was constitutional but when the statute violated the Kentucky Constitution, it was the court's duty to set the statute aside.

A general demurrer was overruled and the agencies and officials refused to plead further. The chancellor adjudged ch. 47, pt. 3, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held Ky. Const. &sect; 3 had no application to the question since the construction of nonprofit hospital facilities was a public purpose. The court held that a private agency could be utilized as the pipe-line through which a public expenditure was made, the test being not who received the money, but the character of the use for which it was expended. The court opined that, because the construction was for the common good, the appropriations of tax money did not violate Ky. Const. &sect; 171. The court found that it was never the intention of Ky.

According to the court, the ordinance met the objections raised by the opponents of the previously rejected ordinance. The court also determined that sufficient notice of the election was given.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment creditor received his judgment against the non-resident under the motor vehicle law providing for substituted service of personal process by serving it on the Secretary of State. The trial court first granted the non-resident's motion for a new trial, and then granted the judgment creditor's motion to set aside that order. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the trial court correctly and properly sustained the non-resident's motion to set aside the personal judgment against him. The substituted service did not give the trial court jurisdiction of the non-resident's person so that a personal judgment could be rendered against him, pursuant to Ky. Civ. Code Prac. &sect; 419. The trial court had no jurisdiction of any rem in which the non-resident had any interest. Therefore, the judgment appealed from was not based on constructive but only on substituted actual service. No warning order attorney was appointed, nor was there any bond given as prescribed by Ky. Civ. Code Prac. &sect; 414, and such failures of practice, together with the absence of any jurisdictional rem, rendered the personal judgment in favor of the judgment creditor absolutely void.</SPAN></P>

The candidate contended that the election officers violated Ky. Res. Stat. Ann. &sect; 126.270(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate ran for election as the county coroner. The tabulation of the voting machines gave him a majority of 31 over another individual. When the count of the ballots of absentee voters had been added, the result was a majority of 119 for other individual, and the certificate of election was issued to that person. The candidate challenged the legal right to count any of these ballots based on the failure of both the county clerk and a member of the Board of Election Commissioners (Kentucky) to write their respective names on each ballot and of the Commissioners to detach the secondary stub from any of them before they were placed in the box. It was further charged that every ballot was exposed to the view of the election officers and their clerical aids with the secondary stub attached, thereby revealing for whom every absentee had voted. The court held that the election contest was unsustainable because the absentee voters were free from fault and the election officials' disregard of the rules for preserving the secrecy of the ballot under &sect; 126.270(1) could not destroy the voters' right of suffrage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued, inter alia, that the act amending Ky. Rev. Stat.

The court held that the title of the act was good, but reversed the judgment finding that the first four sections of the act were constitutional. The sections amending Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 76.080(7), (10), which dealt with sewer rates, were unconstitutional because the act failed to republish the revised sections, but merely stated the changes, in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 51. The section amending Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 76.060 was unconstitutional because it made a city's law director the director of the municipal sewer district in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 165, which prohibited a person from filling two municipal offices at the same time. The court found that the act was constitutional in that it provided for salaries for board members because this issue was a matter of legislative policy.</SPAN></P>

The landowner contended that application of the zoning ordinance to his property violated his constitutional rights and that the board's decision was arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner owned an old house that had a two-story carriage house at the rear corner of the lot. He used the first floor of the carriage house for a garage. The second floor had been used as servants' quarters by the prior owner. The landowner sought to remodel the second floor into a modern apartment that he could rent commercially. The city's zoning ordinance had certain open space and exclusive access requirements that the carriage house did not meet. The ordinance allowed buildings at the rear of lots to be used as servants quarters, but no separate residence could be established there unless the structure met the requirements. The court held that application of the ordinance to the landowner's property did not violate his constitutional rights. The city was free to make the distinction between use of the property as servants quarters and as a separate residence. The ordinance, enacted 15 years before the landowner purchased the property, was not retrospectively applied to the landowner's property. The Board's decision was within its discretion and entitled to great weight.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged judgments of the Edmonson Circuit Court (Kentucky), which ruled in favor of appellees, the Commonwealth of Kentucky and others. The suits involved were an action by the Commonwealth to assess alleged omitted property of the taxpayer, an action by the taxpayer enjoining the collection of taxes, and a challenge to the assessment on certain property. All the suits grew out of a dispute as to the boundary of the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue involved the uncertainty of the boundary line between two counties, with the taxpayer contending that his property was in another county, while the county officials asserted that the property was in their county. When the county attempted collection of the taxes, the taxpayer filed suits for injunctions. After the court ruled that the property was in the county, the county sought to assess back taxes. The court found that the county could not claim the back taxes because the &quot;omitted property&quot; contemplated by Kentucky assessment statutes was property which was not assessed at all, not property which by mistake and in good faith had been assessed in the wrong county. The court also held that assessments voidable by reason of irregularities were not subject to injunctive relief where the taxpayer had a right to appeal by other statutory methods. Finally, the court concluded that circuit court properly refused to award the county recovery on the bond or attorney's fees because, where the injunction was not merely in aid of the relief sought in the suits in which they were issued, but were the sole relief asked and were denied, no recovery on the bonds could be allowed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the judgment of the circuit court holding the property of the taxpayer assessable as omitted taxes with directions to dismiss the Commonwealth's petition.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that &sect; 23.040 did not violate Ky. Const. &sect; 234 by permitting each commonwealth attorney of the districts, who no longer resided in his former district, to retain his office if he moved his residence into a county of the changed district before the expiration of his term. Even if that provision was invalid, it was not such an integral part of the legislative scheme that the manifest purpose of the law would fail if it was deleted. Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23.040 did not violate Ky. Const. &sect; 131 because the act specifically provided for three terms of court annually in each county affected.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, active licensed practitioners, challenged an order of the Boyle Circuit Court (Kentucky) dismissing their petition for a declaration of rights between appellants and appellee unlicensed practitioner. The Kentucky Board of Veterinary Examiners issued appellee a license after the suit was filed. The trial court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 321.210(2), a section of an act regulating the veterinary profession, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that they had a sufficient property right to file the action and that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 321.210(2) was unconstitutional. The court decided the case on the second issue and found that the section was constitutional. The first issue was immaterial if appellee held a license that was issued under a constitutional statute. Appellants contended that &sect; 321.210(2) was unconstitutional because it violated Ky. Const. &sect; 51 when the subject matter was not included in the title of the act. Ky. Rev. Stat. Chapter 321 was titled An Act to regulate the practice of veterinary medicine, surgery, and dentistry in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The title clearly showed that it regulated the enumerated professions and included coverage of the professionals' qualifications. Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 321.210(2) was a grandfather clause and allowed appellee a license without an examination. The section was not arbitrary or unreasonable and was not a special act. It applied to all persons who practiced in the enumerated professions for one year before the enactment of the statute. The legislature had discretion in regulating the professions and its action was not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suit challenged the constitutionality of the act that reorganized three judicial districts into four judicial districts. The act was adjudged to be invalid because it violated Ky. Const. &sect; 138. Section 138 provided that each county having a city of 20,000 inhabitants and a total population of 40,000 or more might constitute a district. The case dealt with two counties, each of which had a population far in excess of the 60,000 basis of apportionment. The citizens took the view that under &sect; 138, a single county could not be made into a separate judicial district, regardless of the exigencies of the situation, unless it had a city with a population of 20,000. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The various provisions of the Kentucky Constitution relating to the creation of districts had to be construed together to give effect to every other constitutional provision. By giving due regard to population, territory, and business and based on the ground of necessity, the redistricting was entirely justified and was not violative of &sect; 138.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the city was planning to annex certain territory comprising a sanitation district undergoing the construction of a new sewer system, an emergency bill was passed by the Kentucky legislature re-enacting Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 220.530, a portion of the Act which provided that a city annexing an entire sanitation district shall become liable for the debts of that district. That action was in response to the court's previous ruling that &sect; 220.530 had been repealed by subsequent legislation and that the city, therefore, would not be liable on the bonds issued to cover the cost of the project. The lower court ruled that the Act was unconstitutional, and the court affirmed, holding that it was arbitrary under Ky. Const., &sect; 2 where it imposed such an oppressive term as to effectually deny the city of its statutory right to annex territory where it would require the city to illegally exceed its revenues or assume an unconstitutional debt by doing so. The court noted that the security of the bondholder required that the sanitation district collect charges from the system's users, and that the Act impermissibly converted that private obligation into a public one payable by the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fiscal court entered an order that provided for the issuance of revenue bonds for the construction of a jail building.

The county was to determine, on an annual basis, whether it elected to use the building. If the county chose to use the building, it paid operating costs and an amount necessary to retire the bonds in due time. The bondholders were to have a lien against the building. The taxpayer filed an action that challenged the issuance of the bonds. The circuit court rendered judgment in favor of the taxpayer, holding that the issuance of the bonds violated Ky. Const. &sect; 157, which prohibited local governments from authorizing indebtedness in excess of its previous year's income without an election. The county appealed. The court reversed, holding that the bonds did not create a debt against the county in excess of the permissible amount because the county was only obligated to pay for the building's use as it chose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question was the existence or nonexistence of power to exact payment for services being rendered to public property or to collect sewer rentals from that property. The court observed no express exemption of any property class or users of the sewer system. The instrumentality was operated and the service was rendered by an independent municipal corporation of limited powers, created by the joint action of the County and the City under an enabling act codified at Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 76.010 et seq. The court noted that the operation's revenue was derived solely from collections and was devoted wholly to the sewer system's maintenance and operation, and no taxing power was exercised. The court pointed out that for delinquent payments, no property lien resulted; the remedy was to cut off service and collect the unsecured debt. The court concluded that sewer rental charges were not taxes or special assessments but possessed commercial characteristics, so there was no reason to construe the comprehensive language as not meaning what it said, under general conceptions of lack of power of one government agency to impose burdens on another absent a positively expressed right.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court adjudged the bonds to be a binding obligation of the city, rendered a judgment against the city on defendants' counterclaim, and provided for the collection of an annual tax to pay the judgment and interest and to create a sinking fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">No sinking fund had been set up to pay the bonds, and the interest had not been paid for many years. After obtaining a default judgment in a common law action for debts assigned to him, a taxpayer filed an equity action to challenge the validity of the proposed bonds. The resulting judgment (prior judgment) recited jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter and the sufficiency of the proof and then adjudged the bonds to be valid. It declared the proposed indebtedness valid and binding, authorized the issuance of the bonds, and made them valid and subsisting obligations of the city that took the place of an outstanding floating indebtedness. The attack made on that judgment below was collateral. On review, the court held that the city was unable to have the prior judgment in its favor set aside as fraudulently procured and rejected arguments that city officials had no authority to enter an appearance in or defend the taxpayer's suit without the common council's express authorization. The court concluded that none of the attacks on the prior judgment amounted to a fraud upon the court such as to justify its nullification in a collateral or even a direct attack.</SPAN></P>

The merchant filed a motion asking the court to direct the circuit court to issue a temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted the ordinance which classified practically all occupations in the city engaged in business and fixed a license tax on the basis of the gross receipts from the business. In general, the ordinance followed the form which such ordinances had taken in cities which had adopted occupational license taxes for revenue or regulation purposes. The merchant's petition for a temporary injunction attacked the validity of the ordinance by asserting that its title was defective and that the city was not authorized to levy such taxes. Under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 84.100, the ordinance could not embrace more than one subject, which had to be expressed in the title. The merchant asserted that the title was misleading, did not show the nature of the exactions required by the ordinance, nor indicate its true purpose. The court held that the title clearly expressed the ordinance's purpose, which was limited to one purpose. Also, the city had the authority to levy the tax, pursuant to Ky. Const. &sect; 181 and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 84.190, which extended the power to enact ordinances imposing license taxes on trades, occupations, and professions to cities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of the trial court judgment which the heirs each had an equal interest in the undevised residential property and that the proceeds from the sale of that residential property were primarily liable for the applicable estate and inheritance taxes, as well as estate administration costs. The court on appeal affirmed that part of the trial court's judgment finding that (1) the inheritance and estate taxes should be paid from that relative part of the decedent's property going to each respective beneficiary, devisee, or legatee; and (2) the tax on the specific bequest to the appellant heir for the trust residue should be paid from the whole of that residue and not from undevised property. The court reversed that portion of the trial court's judgment decreeing the payment of federal excise tax realized from the sale of the undevised property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court determined that the police's search of defendant's car on the public highway without a search warrant was illegal and that the evidence seized by the Commonwealth as a result of such search should have been excluded. Under Ky. Const. &sect; 10, an automobile was not to be stopped on a highway and searched without a warrant unless a misdemeanor was being committed in the presence of the officer or such officer had probable cause to believe that a felony had been committed. The court found that although an arrest by an officer for a misdemeanor committed in his presence could not have been made on mere suspicion, the officer was permitted to act on knowledge coming to him through one or more of his senses. The court held that where the conduct of a person was such that any reasonable person would have concluded that a misdemeanor was being committed, the officer was permitted to make an arrest without a warrant. Because the police saw defendant transporting the alcoholic bottles in his car, the court found that they had requisite suspicion to search the car. The court further determined that the circuit court erred in discharging defendant.</SPAN></P>

The prosecutor had filed suit, after the Act of 1946, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 69.065, had become effective, against the officials for a declaration of rights and a mandamus to compel payment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecutor entered upon his duties as Commonwealth's Attorney for a term of six years. Two years later, he accepted a commission as an officer in the United States Naval Reserve and continued in active service for the next three years. He then resumed his office as Commonwealth's Attorney. Soon after the vacancy of the prosecutor's office was filled on a temporary basis, an opinion was passed down by the Commonwealth's highest court ruling that on becoming an officer in the armed forces of the country such an official did not abandon or forfeit his office. Due to complications, the state officials declined to pay the prosecutor the stipulated statutory compensation either for the time he was in the Navy or after his return. The state officials argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 3, 161, and 235. The court concluded that Act of 1946, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 69.065, did not offend the Kentucky Constitution and was applicable to the remuneration of the prosecutor. The court, however, held that the prosecutor was not entitled to the full sum he would have received had he performed the duties of his office during the period of his absence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee proposed to construct a sewer system at a cost of $ 2,000,000, for which it would issue revenue bonds. The two districts negotiated a contract by which it shall be connected with the city system, now under the control and management of Metro. The parties disagreed on the question whether Metro would have been liable for the debts and liabilities of appellee in case of annexation of the territory by the city. An annexation proceeding was pending. The trial court held that in the event of annexation, Metro would not have become liable for any of appellee's indebtedness, but all of its indebtedness would have become a general obligation of the city, payable from general tax revenues. The court disagreed, holding that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 220.530, pertaining to the annexation of a sewer district by the city and the resulting debt liability, was repealed by the later enactment of 1946, Ky. Rev. Stat. ch. 104. Thus, the city would not have been liable. By reason of the inapplicability of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 220.530 there was no provision of the statutes that would relieve the property in appellee from the obligation to liquidate its revenue bonds or to pay appropriate service charges.</SPAN></P>

The landowners had brought a declaratory judgment actions challenging the district's sewer charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners' and the district's respective predecessors in interest entered into a contract, which was made part of a judgment by agreement in a condemnation action, under which the district took a portion of a landowners' property to install a public sewer thereon, and the landowners had the right to use the sewer. For over 15 years, the landowners used the sewer without charge. Then the district sought to impose a sewer charge on the landowners. The landowners brought an action to bar the district's charges, but the trial court found for the district. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred, because the contract, in the context of the actual course of dealings, should have been construed to entitle the landowners to use the sewer without charge; and although the city had the general authority under its police power to impose charges for sewer usage, it could not simply abrogate the contract, in which the landowners had a property interest, without fairly compensating the landowners for what, under the circumstances, constituted a taking of property by eminent domain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the owner argued it was error to have confiscated his car where the conviction of the driver was void. The owner argued that under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 242.360, a valid conviction of the person arrested was a condition precedent to the right of the Commonwealth to have confiscated and sold the owner's vehicle. The court agreed and reversed the judgment. The owner argued that the conviction of the driver was void because he was not prosecuted by indictment in the circuit court. The court agreed. It held that a court had to have jurisdiction of the subject matter of an offense and of the person. The only authority of the lower court to proceed was based on an indictment. This was an essential element of the subject matter. This jurisdictional requirement could not have been waived by the driver. Thus, because the validity of the conviction depended upon jurisdiction, and because jurisdiction could not have been waived or conferred by consent or agreement, the question could have been raised at any time.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 532.080(5) (amended 1998), persons convicted of a Class D felony and found to be second-degree persistent felony offenders (PFOs) were not eligible for probation, shock probation, or conditional discharge, while under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.080(7 ),persons convicted of a Class D felony and found to be first-degree PFOs were eligible. In reviewing this classification on equal protection grounds, the court applied the rationale basis test and concluded that the classification scheme did not rationally further the state's legitimate goal of reducing prison over-crowding because there was no plausible basis for the classification and it excluded a class of persons similarly situated without a legally sufficient government purpose. The court held that second-degree PFOs were eligible for probation, shock probation, and conditional discharge. Thus, the trial court did not err in considering appellee for probation since he was a second-degree PFO.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed because statutory classification of previous felony offenders (PFOs) for purposes of determining probation eligibility was not rationally related to legitimate government purpose of reducing prison population; second -degree PFOs were eligible for parole, thus trial court did not err in considering appellee for probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued his employer in tort for work injuries claiming the worker's compensation act and amendments were unconstitutional. He also sued the manufacturer of the machinery involved in his injury. Following discovery, plaintiff learned that he sued the wrong manufacturer and amended the complaint, outside the limitations period, to add two different defendant manufacturers. The court granted defendants' summary judgment motions. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the Workers Compensation Act was constitutional since it was not compulsory, and that the Act's amendments did not change the effect of the exclusivity provision, thus plaintiff's remedy was exclusive against his employer under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.690(1). Under the facts of the case, the &quot;discovery rule&quot; did not extend the statute of limitations on the product liability claims nor did Ky. Rev.

Appellee had conceded as true the allegations set forth in appellant's complaint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the decision granting summary judgment to appellee transportation cabinet and issuing a permanent injunction requiring appellant billboard owners to remove the billboard. The court noted that the billboard was illegal where it had lost its nonconforming status because storm damage required more than routine maintenance to repair the billboard. The court rejected the argument that the regulations were without statutory authority, finding that the regulations relating to nonconforming billboards were enacted under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 177.890, which authorized the commissioner of highways to enter into agreements with the federal government for purpose of carrying out the national policy with regard to highways. The court further found that the regulations were not unconstitutionally vague and that the federal legislation mandated the adoption of more strict state standards. The court concluded that it was precluded from addressing the jurisdictional question raised by appellants where the matter was one of pure statutory construction not impinging upon the subject jurisdiction of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 342.320(2)(c) was constitutional. &sect; 342.320(2)(c) did not violate equal protection or due process because the disparate financial situations of an employer and a disabled employee amounted to a rational basis for &sect; 342.320(2)(c) to allow an employee to recover fees without extending the same privilege to an employer. Nor did &sect; 342.320(2)(c) offend an employer's right to appeal. The word &quot;appeal&quot; in &sect; 342.320(2)(c) was intended to refer to an ALJ's de novo review.</SPAN></P>

The fees were limited pursuant to the provisions of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.320(2)(a)(4). The court affirmed the award because Ky. Rev. Stat.

The contract for attorney services was entered into after the effective date of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 320; therefore, fees were limited pursuant to that statute. The court also held that Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee filed a resolution of injury claim with the Department of Workers' Claims. Appellee's claim was assigned to an arbitrator who ruled that appellee was entitled to temporary total disability income benefits. Appellant, appellee's employer, denied that appellee's condition was work related and sought de novo review by an administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ held that the arbitrator's decision was interlocutory and not appealable. The worker's compensation board (board) affirmed the ALJ's decision. On appeal, appellant contended that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 342.275 did not expressly condition the right to review on the finality of the arbitration proceeding. The court disagreed and affirmed the decision. The court reasoned that subjecting the arbitrator's interlocutory awards to immediate appellate scrutiny would undermine the legislature's goal of creating a simpler process and negate the goal of making the process less time consuming. Further, the court held that there is no purported right to appeal from an interlocutory ruling by an arbitrator because this right was not expressly granted in either the Workers' Compensation Act or the board's implementing regulations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a non-profit corporation, challenged the decision of the Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky), which affirmed the revocation of its charitable gaming license by the Justice Cabinet's Division of Charitable Gaming, following appellant's violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 238.550(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a non-profit corporation, had a charitable gaming license. The Justice Cabinet's Division of Charitable Gaming discovered that appellant had violated Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 238.550(4), by failing to retain the required 40 percent of adjusted gross receipts from its charitable gaming operations. Consequently, the Justice Cabinet issued a final order for revocation of appellant's charitable gaming license; the trial court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 238.550(4), and affirmed the administrative revocation. On further review, appellant did not deny that it violated &sect; 238.550(4), but rather maintained that the revocation was unconstitutional. The court found no merit in appellant's constitutional challenge to &sect; 238.550(4), as appellee, the Commonwealth, had an express and legitimate interest in insuring that gaming receipts were used solely for charitable purposes and that they were not unwisely or improperly diverted. The requirement that a significant portion of those receipts be retained and accounted for by the charity was rationally related to the state objective, and the requirement to retain 40 percent was not unreasonable.

The administrative law judge and appellee Workers' Compensation Board both declined to make a determination on constitutionality because the constitutionality of a statute was reserved for a court of justice. The appellate court held that because &sect; 342.320(2)(c) made a reasonable classification, it was not impermissible class legislation under Ky. Const. &sect; 59. Similarly, because &sect; 342.320(2)(c) was rationally related to a legitimate state objective, it was not a violation of equal protection or substantive due process, under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Furthermore, procedural due process was not violated because &sect; 342.320(2)(c) required notice and an opportunity to be heard.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was indicted and confined to a correctional psychiatric center for an evaluation of his competency to stand trial. Following the evaluation, the trial court held that appellee, due to mental illness, was incompetent to stand trial. Appellee was ordered confined to a state hospital pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 504.110(2) and Ky. Rev. Stat. ch. 202A. After he was declared competent, appellee pleaded guilty and was sentenced. The trial court gave appellee credit for the time he spent in the correctional psychiatric center and the state hospital. Appellant Commonwealth of Kentucky challenged the order granting appellee credit for the time he spent at the state hospital. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case. The trial court incorrectly determined appellee's hospitalization period to be time spent in custody within the meaning of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 532.120. Appellee was committed to the state hospital under &sect; 504.110(2) and ch. 202A. Although he was incompetent to stand trial, had he not met the criteria of ch. 202A, he could not have been involuntarily hospitalized and would not have been confined for the time periods with which he was credited.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also erred in denying appellant manufacturer's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because it had merely produced a component part which comported to state of the art standards when it was manufactured. The court otherwise affirmed the trial court's judgment. Appellant distributor breached its duty of ordinary care in distributing the defective truck. The statute of limitations, Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 304.39-230(6), did not bar the action against appellant distributor. Ky. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was indicted for, among other things, operating a motor vehicle on a license revoked or suspended for driving under the influence (OSL), third offense, a Class D felony under Ky.

Appellant Commonwealth of Kentucky challenged that decision. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case. Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 189A.090 did not include a time limitation on the use of prior OSL convictions to enhance subsequent convictions. Further, &sect; 189A.090 was on its face unambiguous, and the fact that the trial court had applied &sect; 189A.090 in an earlier case and denied a motion to suppress a prior OSL did not prove that &sect; 189A.090 was arbitrarily and discriminately enforced.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were government employees contending that appellee local government failed to make contributions to a pension plan pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 67A.520. Appellants sought review after the lower court determined that appellee had complied with the statute. Appellants asserted that appellee failed to make its required annual contribution to a pension fund and sought a judgment equal to the difference between the annual contribution they alleged was required by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 67A.520 and the contributions actually made by appellee. On review, the court agreed with the appellants that the Legislature contemplated that the fund was to be updated with proper payments. However, the court noted that a Board of Trustees (BOT) was appointed and authorized to dictate the contributions. The court noted that it did not have the authority to change the make-up of the BOT or to interpret the statute in such a way as to eliminate the responsibility of the BOT to establish the government's contribution rate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer challenged a judgment of the Workers' Compensation Board (Kentucky), which affirmed the decision of the administrative law judge and awarded workers' compensation benefits to appellee employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee employee worked in the coal industry and appellant was his last employer. Appellee employee filed a claim for retraining incentive benefits and claimed that he had contracted pneumoconiosis. The administrative law judge (ALJ) issued his opinion that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 342.315 did not apply retroactively to claims filed before the enactment and deduced that appellee employee suffered from pneumoconiosis. Appellee Workers' Compensation Board concurred with the ALJ's decision. Appellant challenged appellee board's decision and contended the statute was applicable and should apply to all claims. The court affirmed appellee board's decision and reasoned that the language of the statute was clear and that the presumptive weight provision was substantive, not procedural in nature and, hence, should not be applied retroactively to claims, such as appellee employee's, filed prior to the enactment of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court, awarding workers' compensation benefits to appellee employee, was affirmed. The court reasoned that appellee Workers' Compensation Board was correct in its determination and that the statute should not apply retroactively to claims filed before the statute's enactment. Moreover, because the statute posed substantial changes, it would be unfair to apply it retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant jailer appealed from a judgment of the Clinton Circuit Court (Kentucky, which found in favor of appellee fiscal court. The jailer alleged that his salary had been unlawfully reduced during his term of office in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 441.245(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In late May of 1993, the fiscal court reduced the salary of jailer from $ 26,000 to $ 15,000. Elected in November, the jailer began his duties in January at the $ 15,000 rate. The fiscal court then reinstated the $ 26,000 pay, but reduced it again to $ 12,000 when the county discontinued operation of the jail. The jailer filed a complaint, and the trial court determined that he was entitled to the $ 15,000 rate. On appeal, the court vacated the ruling, finding that the jailer was entitled to a salary of $ 26,600 according to the plain meaning of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 441.245(4), which governed a jailer's salary. First, even though his duties as jailer were modified after he assumed office, his compensation could not have been reduced during his tenure under Ky. Const. &sect; 161. Second, pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 441.245(4), except as provided in &sect; 441.245(5), the jailer's compensation for 1983 and subsequent years had to have been equal to the prior year's compensation and could only have been adjusted by the fiscal court for the change in the prior year's consumer price index. Therefore, the salary of $ 26,000, which was the salary the previous year, was proper.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded for a determination of the difference in compensation to which the jailer was entitled, which was $ 26,000, the rate for jailers for the year before he was elected.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that rewards should have been given to each staff member that had generated the reward. The principal had a reasonable expectation that he would have received his portion of the reward funds one they had arrived. The court determined that the wording of the statute showed the legislative intent to have rewarded the individual staff members and not the school itself.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 220.035 and refused to enjoin defendants from exercising any of the powers purportedly delegated to them under that statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the sanitation district had been formed, the legislature passed Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 220.035, which gave to county fiscal courts the substantial supervisory powers over the district's operation. The court agreed with the sanitation district that the powers to review, approve, amend, or disapprove its acquisition of realty, capital improvements and its budget as provided in &sect; 220.035 resulted in a significant shift in authority between the sanitation district and the fiscal court. Nevertheless, there was nothing in the Kentucky Constitution that specifically safeguarded those powers in the sanitation district. Section 220.035 did not purport to take any authority away from the cabinet, but merely allows fiscal courts to have concurrent oversight authority. The sanitation district contended that the statute was an improper delegation of legislative authority as it allowed the various fiscal courts to determine what the law was in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 60. However, the court believed it clear that such enabling legislation was constitutionally sound.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed an action seeking an adjudication that he was the sole heir and putative child of a decedent who had died intestate.

Following a jury verdict, the trial court entered a judgment that found plaintiff was not the heir of the decedent. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held plaintiff was not entitled to a summary judgment on the basis defendants failed to timely respond to his request for admissions where the trial court had permitted defendants to file their response out of time and it was within its discretion to do so. The court determined a statute that required a child born of wedlock to establish paternity by clear and convincing evidence, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 391.105, was not unconstitutional because important state interests justified treating legitimate and illegitimate children differently. The court noted the state had substantial interests in promoting the efficient administration of a decedent's estate and avoiding spurious claims arising out of paternity actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the three counts based upon the authorities cited by defendants. On appeal the commonwealth argued that the trial court lacked the authority to summarily dismiss the three counts prior to trial and the trial court's ruling was legally erroneous. The court reversed the dismissal of the three counts and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that if the trial court considered the evidence in reaching its decision it was in effect applying a summary judgment standing. Because a trial court lacked the authority to use a summary judgment procedure in a criminal case, dismissal of the three counts of the indictment on that basis would have been improper. The court also held that there were no constitutional violations regarding the charges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reassessments of the property owners' property significantly raised the property value of the parcels of land from the previous year. In support of their summary judgment motion, the property owners argued that the statutes governing property assessment were unconstitutional because they did not provide any guidelines or measuring sticks for determining the cash value of property. The court ruled that the trial court properly applied recent decisions to reject the property owners' challenge. Specifically, the court noted that a prior decision held that an assessor did not need to be instructed on any particular method of assessment so long as the resulting assessment was fair and equitable. The court further noted that another decision determined that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 132.450 was not unconstitutional merely because it failed to provide standards for tax assessments. The court emphasized that the property owners failed to address these prior instructive decisions. Moreover, the court observed that if the property owners believed that the assessments were too high, they should have followed the appellate process provided in the governing statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order denying the property owners' summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the tape of the minor changing her clothes appealed to a prurient interest in sexual conduct. The court held that &sect; 531.310 was constitutional because given the state's compelling interest in the protection of children, the sexual conduct by minors prohibited by the statute was not required to be patently offensive or of limited literary or artistic value in order to be obscene. The court found that defendant's actions violated Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 531.300(4)(d) because the video was taken for the purpose of sexual gratification and depicted the minor in a manner such that the predominate appeal of the tape was to a prurient interest in the sexual conduct of the minor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county filed an action against the coal company for its failure to pay local franchise taxes under &sect; 136.120. The coal company admitted to not paying the taxes, but alleged that it did not have to pay the taxes under &sect; 136.120 as a public service corporation because it was a private business entity. The trial court granted summary judgment for the county and found that &sect; 136.120 was constitutional as applied to solid waste disposal facilities. The disposal company appealed. The court affirmed and held that there was a rational basis for the inclusion of municipal solid waste disposal facilities with public service corporations for taxation purposes under &sect; 136.120. The court reasoned that the classification was reasonably related to the general assembly's goals for solid waste management. Further, the court concluded that the public service corporation property tax under &sect; 136.120 and the license fee under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 68.178 were not double taxation. The court also found that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 136.120 complied with Ky. Const. &sect; 51, which required that the title of an act agree with the body of the act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conveyance of certain property expressly reserved mineral rights beneath the land. Appellee successor grantor held title to the mineral rights. Appellant successor grantee brought tort action that sought compensatory and punitive damages after the successor grantor engaged in mining activities beneath the conveyed property. The Circuit Court, Harlan County (Kentucky) directed verdict in favor of successor grantor. The successor grantee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the successor grantees argued that the lower court erred in finding a clause within the deed that absolved the successor grantor from liability, in awarding the directed verdict, and in failing to permit the jury to determine whether the successor grantor conducted mining operations in an oppressive manner. They also argued that the punitive damage award should not have been granted and that they should have been to allowed establish their own damages. On cross appeal, the successor grantor argued that the lower court erred by submitting the successor grantees' equipment damage claim to the jury. The court found that the parties to the deed clearly agreed that at some point the mineral rights reserved might be mined and that any such mining would likely be by full seam extraction techniques which would leave no support for the coal or surface strata above the mined seam. Therefore, the deed's damage waiver clause was specifically intended by the parties to the deed and was valid and enforceable. As far as the successor grantor's argument, the court found that the lower court did err by failing to direct a verdict with respect to the equipment claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-employee suffered a non-work related hip injury. After returning to work, the ex-employee suffered another back injury which caused her to file a workers' compensation claim. The administrative law judge ruled that the ex-employee was 100 percent disabled, but that 40 percent of her disability was the result of the prior, noncompensable hip injury and an additional 40 percent of her disability was due to non-work spontaneous fractures. The ALJ directed that her benefits be reduced by 10 percent beginning at age 65 and by 10 percent each year thereafter until age 70. The board affirmed the ALJ's judgment, and the ex-employee appealed. The court affirmed the board's decision. The court found that the ALJ was correct in apportioning the ex-employee's disability because many of her injuries were due to non-work related causes. The court found that her non-work related injuries did not entitle the ex-employee to more or extended benefits because the benefits were compensation for lost wages. The court held that the limitation on benefits based on age was constitutional because persons over 65 had less earning capacity than those under 65, and benefits compensated for lost wages.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court entered an order denying the prisoners' request for class certification, joined the parties into one action, and dismissed their combined petitions for declaratory judgment. Only the prisoner appealed. The court stated that CPP 15.3 authorized the award of meritorious good time, but clearly granted discretion to prison administrators as to whether the award was given. Because the award of meritorious good time under CPP 15.3 was left entirely to the discretion of prison administrators, the court held that inmates such as the prisoner had no protected liberty interest at stake in its denial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state agencies and state officials, sought review of a judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) that determined that the Kentucky Charitable Gaming Act (Act), Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 238.500 -.995, was in part unconstitutional. Appellees, various charitable organizations and others, had previously filed declaratory judgment actions, which were consolidated, to determine the constitutionality of various portions of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charitable organizations filed declaratory judgment actions, which were consolidated, to determine the constitutionality of various portions of the Act. The trial court found several of the portions challenged constitutional, but found that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 237.570(1) violated Ky. Const. &sect; 226(2)(f) because the fee imposed on charitable gaming was used for regulatory purposes, rather than for charitable purposes. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's finding that portions of the statute were unconstitutional, holding that Ky. Const. &sect; 226(2)(f) gave the Kentucky Legislature the authority to pass laws necessary to assure the proper functioning of charitable gaming, including the regulatory fee in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 237.570(1), and that Ky. Const. &sect; 226(2)(d) only required that net proceeds be expended for charitable proceeds. The court also reversed the trial court's finding that tipping of volunteer charitable gaming workers was legal, based upon the amendment of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 238.540(4) to explicitly prohibit tipping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That portion of the trial court judgment that determined sections of the Act were constitutional was affirmed. However, that portion of the trial court judgment that concluded that sections of the Act were unconstitutional was reversed. All portions of the Act which the charitable organizations had standing to challenge were thus declared constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cabinet assessed additional sales taxes against the corporation and denied the corporation's request for a refund. The corporation challenged the Cabinet's assessment and the Board determined that the taxes had been properly assessed. On further review, the circuit court affirmed the decision of the Board. The corporation appealed from that order and the court affirmed. The corporation argued that the term &quot;cost of production&quot; as used in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 139.480(3) did not include the cost of the crude oil it purchased to process for customers and that such an inclusion was improper because it doubled the manufacturing costs of the crude oil. The court rejected the argument and held that because the corporation was involved in only one stage of production or processing, the cost of the crude oil had to be included in the corporation's single calculation of its &quot;cost of production.&quot; The court reasoned that it was only where the corporation, as taxpayer, had two discrete stages of production that it could have included the cost of materials in the first stage and would not have been required to include the cost again in the second stage.</SPAN></P>

Appellee school district cross-appealed the ruling mandating the exam was open for public review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents contended that the Kentucky Instructional Results Information System (KIRIS) assessment exam, which assessed student skills in reading, mathematics, writing, science, and social studies, asked questions that violated 20 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1232h(b). The court disagreed. The court also held, contrary to appellant's contention, that the content of the KIRIS exam questions did not advance or inhibit religion, nor did it foster any government entanglement with religion. The court held that the state's interest in the improvement of the educational system through the use of an assessment program such as the KIRIS exam was sufficiently compelling to require all students to take the KIRIS exam. Because of the importance of the KIRIS exam as a tool for measuring the efficiency and improvement of Kentucky schools, and its potential for abuse, the court held that the KIRIS exam should not be open for general public viewing without a special showing of necessity beyond simple curiosity as to its content.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed in part, and reversed and remanded in part.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant revenue cabinet requested interlocutory relief from an injunction issued by the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky), which prevented the revenue cabinet from issuing certain intangible property tax refunds unless certain conditions were met.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class action plaintiffs were successful in their action against the revenue cabinet for property tax refunds. The trial court entered an injunction that required creation of an escrow fund for payment of the class action plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. Claiming that the withholding of escrow funds from the property tax refunds would be too time consuming and costly, the revenue cabinet filed a request for interlocutory relief from the injunction requiring deposits into the escrow account from each refund issued. The court denied the request for interlocutory relief. The court found that the revenue cabinet had standing to bring its motion because it was attempting to avoid administrative and interest expenses. The court found that a substantial question regarding the common fund procedure for awarding attorneys' fees had been raised, that irreparable injury had been shown because the failure to withhold funds might cause unfairness in the payment of the fees, and that under the equities involved, including the public interest and alleged harm to the revenue cabinet, the issuance of the injunction was favored.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the revenue cabinet's motion for interlocutory relief from the temporary injunction that required the revenue cabinet to withhold a portion from each refund check to compensate for the class action plaintiffs' attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 508.140 in the Scott Circuit Court (Kentucky), after entering a Ky. R. Crim. Proc. 8.09 conditional plea of guilty, contending that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A domestic violence order was entered against defendant and when he continued his behavior against his wife, he was charged with first-degree stalking. He entered a conditional plea of guilty and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that when read in conjunction with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 508.130, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 508.140 defined the offense of stalking with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people could have determined what conduct was prohibited. Under any definition of the phrase, there was no &quot;legitimate purpose&quot; for defendant's conduct. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 508.130(2) specifically excluded constitutionally protected activity from the definition of a &quot;course of conduct&quot; that would have violated Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 508.140. Because Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 508.130(1)(b) required the course of conduct to be such that would have caused a reasonable person to suffer substantial mental distress, the meaning of &quot;seriously alarms, annoys, intimidates, or harasses&quot; was not determined by the victim's subjective feelings. All of the terms to which defendant objected were commonly understood by ordinary people.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Fayette Circuit Court (Kentucky). Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of two counts of trafficking in a simulated substance in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.350, one count each of trafficking in a controlled substance in the first degree, and being a persistent felony offender in the first degree.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was videotaped selling rocks of crack cocaine to an undercover police officer.

Defendant testified at trial that he did make the transactions but that he thought the substance he sold was &quot;flick,&quot; a street name for fake cocaine, and not cocaine. On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 218A.350 was unconstitutional because it failed to serve any legitimate government purpose. Defendant also argued that he was entitled to a directed verdict on the charge of trafficking in a controlled substance in the first degree, because the Commonwealth did not prove that defendant intended to traffic in a controlled substance. The court held that: (1) the validity of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.350 was a matter of first impression in Kentucky; (2) because there were rational reasons based upon the police power to support &sect; 218A.350, it was not unconstitutional; and (3) because under the evidence as a whole, it would not have been clearly unreasonable for the jury to find guilt, defendant was not entitled to a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the claim and the applicant sought review. The court held that regardless of which statute of limitations applied, the applicant could not maintain an action pursuant to &sect; 161.164(4) because that statute protected only current employees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction and sentence entered by the trial court upon a jury verdict that convicted defendant of first-degree manslaughter, and claimed that improper procedure was employed to appoint a special judge, that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, and that it was error to deny him exemption from stricter probation and parole standards as a victim of domestic violence. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court failed to address any error in the appointment of the special judge, as defendant failed to object to the authority of the one who appointed the special judge when appointment was made and was subsequently barred from raising the issue for the first time on appeal. Defendant's failure to serve the attorney general with a copy of his challenge to the validity of any statute barred appellate review of defendant's vagueness claim. The trial court properly denied exemptions from restrictions on probation, as there was no evidence that defendant had been a victim of domestic violence or that defendant actually feared the carrying out of threats made by the victim.</SPAN></P>

The defendant's sentence for each substantive offense was enhanced pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.992 because he was in possession of a firearm at the time the offenses were committed.</SPAN></P>

Just prior to the defendant stopping, the officer saw him throw a bag out of the car window. The officer placed the defendant under arrest for attempting to elude police. A search of the defendant's person produced cash and prescription medication. The bag thrown from the car contained small plastic bags of pills, and the search of the car revealed a loaded handgun and marijuana. Prior to trial, the defendant sought to dismiss the charges, arguing that the police officer lacked the statutory authority to arrest him. He also filed a motion to suppress the evidence found as the products of an illegal search and seizure. The trial court denied both motions. On appeal from the defendant's conviction, the court affirmed. The court found that the officer was authorized to make the arrest. The court also found that &sect; 218A.992 was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad and did not violate the double jeopardy prohibition, as double jeopardy did not result when a court allowed the same prior convictions to be used to enhance the penalty for multiple subsequent convictions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the action, ruling that the taxpayers lacked standing to maintain the action. The funds for the fiscal year were immediately disbursed. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that: 1) because disbursements for the following year were pending, and the legislature was likely to continue such disbursements, the issues raised in the appeal were not moot; 2) caselaw supported the taxpayers' contention that status as a taxpayer was sufficient to confer standing; 3) the taxpayers met the requirements of standing by alleging that the expenditure was unconstitutional, that they and other taxpayers were injured by the government action in the alleged illegal expenditure of their taxes, and they were appropriate parties as taxpayers to bring this action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, several counties and a county association, challenged a judgment of the Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky), which granted appellee Commonwealth of Kentucky's motion for judgment in appellants' action for an interpretation of Ky. Const. &sect; 254 and an order in the nature of mandamus, requiring the Commonwealth to reimburse the counties for expenses for housing convicted felons under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 431.215(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the Commonwealth was liable for the counties' expenses for housing convicted felons in county jails pending their transfer to a state penitentiary before the five-day lapse between sentencing and the Commonwealth's liability to pay the counties under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 431.215(2). Appellants argued that the term &quot;convicts&quot; as used in Ky. Const. &sect; 254 referred to one who had confessed in open court to a felony, one who had pled guilty to a felony, or one who had a jury verdict of guilt returned on an indictment for a felony. The court held that the word &quot;convicts&quot; in &sect; 254 meant one who was convicted and sentenced to a state facility for a felony and that it did not include one who had confessed or pled guilty or one who had been found guilty by a jury. The court further held that the Commonwealth was obligated to accept financial responsibility for the financial burdens at the time that a sentence was imposed. Additionally, the court held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 431.215(2) was unconstitutional under Ky. Const. &sect; 254 to the extent that it allowed the Commonwealth to delay reimbursement to county jails for five days after the entry of judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling as to the definition of &quot;convict.&quot; However, the court reversed the ruling that the Commonwealth was allowed to delay reimbursement to county jails for five days after the entry of judgment. The court further remanded the matter for further proceedings as to an order of mandamus requiring the Commonwealth to begin reimbursement immediately.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers argued that the property was still held for a public purpose since it would be turned over to the airport at the end of the lease term.

The employee worked for appellee employer, a Kentucky coal corporation, for a year and sought income or retraining incentive benefits after he allegedly contracted coal workers' pneumoconiosis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a heavy equipment operator in Virginia's coal mines for 13 years. Thereafter, he took a position with the employer in Kentucky where he worked for another year. He then filed a workers' compensation claim, seeking income or retraining incentive benefits. Though the administrative law judge found that the employee suffered from coal workers' pneumoconiosis, he also found that the employee had not met the jurisdictional requirements of &sect; 342.316(3)(b), which provided that the employee had to work for at least two years in Kentucky to receive benefits. It was undisputed that the employee was exposed to the hazards of coal workers' pneumoconiosis for only one year in Kentucky. The Board denied benefits. On appeal, the court held that benefits were properly denied, finding that &sect; 342.316(3)(b) was rationally related to a legitimate state interest. The court further found that the employee's right to occupational disease benefits was purely statutory in nature and did not fall under the ambit of Ky. Const. &sect; 14. Additionally, the court held that &sect; 342.316(3)(b) did not conflict with Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 342.610(1), 342.640(1), and 342.690(1).</SPAN></P>

Another doctor read two x-rays as showing pneumoconiosis and three x-rays as negative. Additional doctors found pneumoconiosis by x-ray. On review, the court affirmed. It found that the ALJ had not only relied on the positive x-ray readings but also the employee's 21-year employment history of working in a coal mine. The ALJ was warranted in finding that the employee met his burden of proving category 1 pneumoconiosis and was entitled to retraining incentive benefits.

The court held that the benefit of encouraging coal workers who have contracted pneumoconiosis to leave before coming disabled was rationally related to the legitimate governmental objectives of affording protection to all of the state's industry by preventing an economic drain caused by special fund assessments for compensation claims related to pneumoconiosis.

The Board affirmed the ALJ's award. On appeal, the employer claimed that the statute concerning RIB awards was unconstitutional under Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 2 and 59. The court disagreed and affirmed the Board's decision. The court first held that the statute did not violate due process under Ky. Const. &sect; 2. The court held that because the statute involved regulation of economic matters, it had to be rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective. The court held that the statute was rationally related to the legitimate state objective of protecting against an economic drain of a special fund for compensation claims. The court then held that the statute did not amount to special legislation in violation of Ky. Const. &sect; 59. The court held that the statute lawfully encouraged coal workers who had contracted occupational pneumoconiosis but who had not yet sustained a significant respiratory impairment to leave the industry before they became disabled. The court concluded that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The injured motorist filed a claim for benefits and was paid basic reparations in October 1991. In July 1993, the injured motorist filed an action in Kentucky to recover for his personal injuries. The statute of limitations that he relied upon was Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 304.39-230(1), which called for a two-year limitations after the last payment of benefits. The driver relied upon a borrowing statute,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.320, which mandated the use of the Ohio limitations period in the matter. Under the Ohio statute, the limitations period had run, and, therefore, the circuit court dismissed the action. On appeal, the injured motorist claimed that the borrowing statute denied him of his right to free travel. He also claimed that the time was tolled because both parties had left Ohio. The court affirmed the circuit court's finding and held that the borrowing statute and its effect were constitutional. As the forum state, Kentucky properly applied the law of Ohio, which had an interest in the multistate activity.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the drug testing was not an impermissible invasion of the drivers' constitutional rights. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment, finding the regulations were proper. The court found that the statutes were enacted to further a legitimate state interest in the safe transportation of public school children and that the public interest in determining a driver's ability to drive safely at the time of the accident was a compelling reason to dispense with a hearing prior to testing.</SPAN></P>

The court granted reversal of the verdict. The court reasoned that the witness through which the ALJ's opinion was introduced had no familiarity with it whatever. As a result, the court found that the evidence was not properly authenticated and was not properly admitted. However, the court held that upon remand if the ALJ's opinion was properly authenticated it would be admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation maintained that &sect; 342.732(1)(a) was unconstitutional because it was special legislation and was violative of due process. The court affirmed the decision. The court determined that for a law to be constitutionally general, it had to apply to all in a class and there had to be distinctive and natural reasons inducing and supporting the classification. The court explained that the Workers' Compensation Act, and as a corollary Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 342.732, was not special legislation even though it applied only to certain employers and employees. The court noted that legislative classifications could have been used to regulate employer/employee relations where the classification was consistent with correcting an abuse or problem, which the legislature sought to cure. The court concluded that &sect; 342.732 and the classifications created therein were rationally related to a legitimate state objective. The court found that &sect; 342.732 was constitutional because it furthered the goals of lessening the economic drain on the Special Fund caused by claims due to coal mine employment, reducing workers' compensation payments, and providing an alternative to total disability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the trucking corporation asserted that the dismissal of its indemnity action was inappropriate because such claims were neither collateral nor dependent and thus remained cognizable under the Board of Claims Act, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44.070 et seq. Alternatively, the trucking corporation contended that if Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44.070(1) precluded indemnity claims against Commonwealth, the statute was unconstitutional. The court found that as immunity with respect to indemnification and contribution actions was not specifically and expressly waived under &sect; 44.070(1), it was expressly preserved by the terms of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44.072. The court noted that both indemnity and contribution depended upon liability by one or both parties to the original claimant who suffered the original loss. Therefore, both indemnity and contribution were &quot;dependent on loss to another and not the claimant,&quot; as provided for in Ky. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44.070(1). The court concluded by holding that indemnity was no longer cognizable under &sect; 44.070(1) and the statute was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

The fund and the employers filed cross-appeals from the board's decision to permit one widow to file an independent action for dependent benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widows filed claims for disability benefits based on their husbands' exposure to asbestos more than a decade before. The widows' claims were abated pending a supreme court decision, which did not give an amended 20-year statute of limitations for asbestos claims retroactive affect. Based on that decision, the board dismissed the widows' disability claims because the version of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316(3)(a) in effect at the time of last exposure contained a five-year statute of repose. The court affirmed the dismissal of the disability claims, holding that the five-year statute of repose was not unconstitutional. The court reversed the board's finding that widow one had the right to bring an independent dependent claim under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.750 because her husband's claims were not merely time barred by the statute of limitations, but rather were forever barred by the repose provision. Because a repose provision was substantively different than a statute of limitations, the employer and the fund were entitled to rely on the repose provision to free them from any liability for compensation after the passage of five years from the husbands' exposure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the board's decision affirming the dismissal of the widows' disability claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state of Florida suspended the driver's license in response to the notification by the state of Kentucky that his license had been suspended for driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUI). The driver returned to Kentucky and complied with all but one of the requirements for the restoration of his Kentucky license. He did not produce, as required by 601 Ky. Admin. Regs. 12:020, &sect; 2, a clearance letter from Florida showing that the license issued him by that state was no longer suspended. The driver argued that &sect; 2 denied him the equal protection of the laws because it treated applicants with suspended out-of-state operator's licenses differently than those applicants with suspended Kentucky licenses. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the driver. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that &sect; 2 bore a rational relationship to the state's interests. There was a strong governmental interest in protecting the public from drivers whose licenses had been suspended for DUI offenses and in preventing &quot;license shopping&quot; by nonresidents with suspended out-of-state licenses trying to obtain Kentucky licenses before their suspension period had ended.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment. The court determined that there was no ambiguity in the wording of &sect; 150.090(1). The court explained that statutes were to be construed according to the plain meaning of the words contained therein.

The judgment declared that a quadrennial tax revaluation plan (QTRP) established by the PVA violated Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 2, 171, and 172.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The QTRP was prepared by the PVA in an effort to comply with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 132.690 which required, in addition to the yearly assessment of real property, that all real property be physically examined at least once every four years. The QTRP broke the county into four geographic sections; the physical exam of realty in each section was scheduled for a particular year. The assessment of the taxpayer's property, examined in the QTRP's second year, was increased. The taxpayer argued that because two other sections would not have their property examined until years three and four, the QTRP violated Ky. Const. &sect; 2, which prohibited the State from exercising arbitrary power over property, and Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 171, 172 which required that the assessment of realty be uniform. Reversing the judgment, the court declared that absolute equality was not essential to the validity of a tax assessment, and given the manpower limitations of the PVA, the QTRP was not unreasonable, and did not show an intent to discriminate which would be necessary to finding that it violated the Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 2, 171 and 172.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment granted by the trial court to the property owner and remanded the case with directions that a judgment be entered upholding the challenged quadrennial tax revaluation plan.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the lower court's decision because the tax imposed by the city was arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious; and hence, unconstitutional. The court found that the ordinance under which the tax was created was prohibited special legislation since it violated the equality mandate of the Kentucky Constitution. The court held that the general assembly of the state might by general laws only have provided for this species of revenue. The court noted that if a few, or any number of persons less than all, who followed a designated trade, occupation, or profession were exempt, while others were taxed, then the law would not have been general, but rather special and local. The court found that this equality provision was violated and special legislation was created because several businesses similar in nature to the corporation, but listed in a separate city ordinance, were not required to pay the license fee.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 140.310(1) because the niece was not a &quot;qualified person&quot; as defined by Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 140.300(5).

Stat. &sect; 64.345(2) provided that, in counties with a city of the first class and in counties with an urban-county form of government, an order of the chief judge of the circuit court should fix the necessary office expenses of the sheriff. Ky. Rev.

The trial court declared that the statutory provisions were unconstitutional on the ground that they unreasonably interfered with the function of the judicial department. The sheriff appealed the judgment. The court, which disagreed with the trial court, nevertheless held that the statutory provisions were an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to a judicial officer in the light of modern circumstances. The court found that the statutory provisions set no standard set by which a circuit judge should set the number and compensation of deputies.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with promoting a sexual performance by a minor, in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat.

Both defendant's appealed the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 531.310 and 531.320. The court held the statutes were constitutional. The court held &sect; 531.310 was not overbroad because it might criminalize nudity, holding that the remainder of the statute would remain intact and that the jury was properly instructed that the phrase exhibition of genitals meant in an obscene manner. Likewise, the court held that &sect; 531.310 was not unconstitutionally vague because the definition of the word obscene contained the phrase prurient and did not further define the word. The court also held that the statute was not invalid because it did require an element of scienter. The court affirmed the conviction of defendant who pled guilty, but reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial for the other defendant, holding that the prosecutor's misstatement of law regarding the test for insanity constituted reversible error.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed that conviction on appeal. The court reasoned that the record supported the determination that defendant consciously and voluntarily intended to be absent from his trial, and that there was no deprivation of his constitutional right to confront his accusers. The court also held that defendant was not deprived of his right to counsel because there was no contention that his first attorney could not have withdrawn or that defendant could not employ his own attorney. The court further determined that there was no wrongful deprivation of a right to a jury trial because defendant never requested one and there was no right to a jury at common law for the offense of breaching a public duty. The court also concluded that the government did not breach any duty that it had to disclose exculpatory evidence because defendant indisputably possessed the information on which he based that claim, and that defendant had to comply with &sect; 522.030 because it was never effectively and finally declared to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

While a hearing was being held on the noncompliance notice, an inspector who had just observed the plant illegally dumping waste, personally served a cessation order on the plant's representative who was at the hearing. About three weeks later, upon receipt of the cessation order by mail, the plant commenced the required reclamation. The cabinet then assessed a penalty for failure to timely remedy the cited violations. The court reversed the finding that the cabinet's penalty assessment was in error and held that Ky. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.221 provided gasoline dealers a credit against the excise tax imposed on fuel-grade alcohol, with a higher credit allowed on purchases of alcohol distilled in the state and a lower credit given on qualified purchases of fuel-grade alcohol from other states. Qualified purchases were from states that gave reciprocal tax benefits for fuel-grade alcohol produced in Kentucky. Ohio's similar reciprocal fuel tax credit statute was found to discriminate against interstate commerce and was held unconstitutional. The companies sought a refund for a two-year period for the difference between the total tax credit for out-of-state and in-state purchases. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The statute was applied nonretroactively because it did not decide an issue of first impression whose resolution was clearly foreshadowed, retroactive application would limit the legislature's future attempts to legitimately tax interstate commerce, and it avoided inequitable results. The companies were only entitled to refunds of contested taxes paid for a one month period from the time the statute was held unconstitutional to the end of the quarterly tax period.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 281.650 was part of a comprehensive scheme of regulation of motor carriers that operated within Kentucky. The fee schedule was held unconstitutional as applied to carriers regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), and the carriers, who were ICC-exempt, filed an action alleging that &sect; 281.650 was unconstitutional in that it imposed an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce and violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees, and the carriers sought review. The court affirmed as to the question of undue burden, but it reversed and remanded as to equal protection. The evidence consisted of conflicting affidavits concerning the administrative procedures for handling permits for ICC-exempt carriers and ICC-regulated carriers, and a genuine factual dispute existed which precluded entry of summary judgment on that issue. The carriers were entitled to fully explore and test the basis upon which the Commonwealth justified the disparate treatment of exempt and regulated carriers and to attempt to prove their theory of improper post-hoc rationalization in full-blown adversarial context.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was not a taking that required compensation because the companies did not have a reasonable expectation of continuing indefinitely to provide sewer services and because they were privileged to sell sewer services only as their permits from the state allowed. The court found that there was no physical taking because the county never physically occupied any of the premises owned by the companies. The court found that the companies did not have legal title to the sewer mains because the developers of the subdivisions where the sewer mains were located paid for the installation of the sewer lines.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked as a coal miner for 14 years.

The employee ceased work because of a stomach ailment, and during his evaluations, he was diagnosed as having coal workers' pneumoconiosis. He was told to avoid further dust exposure, and he filed a claim for benefits. The ALJ determined that the employee was totally disabled from coal workers' pneumoconiosis and which ordered the employer to pay 60 percent of the employee's benefits. The Board affirmed the award, and the employer appealed, arguing that there was a mixed versus single exposure. The court affirmed, holding that the ALJ concluded, and the Board agreed, that the previous employment was not sufficient to contribute to the disease, even though the physician who diagnosed the employee was apparently not aware of the limited exposure to sand and dust and fumes. The employer failed in its burden to show that the evidence was so overwhelming as to have compelled a finding in its favor, and based on all the evidence, there was no error in the ALJ's findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor was injured when a free-standing basketball hoop fell on him while he was playing on a school playground. The minor and his friends had removed the cement counterweights from the goal's base in order to tip the supporting structure. The court partially affirmed and partially reversed the judgment below. The trial court properly found that Kentucky's &quot;recreational use statute,&quot; Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.190, which limited a landowner's liability, applied to the situation. Here, the bishop showed that he condoned of the public making use of his property because he left the gates open so children could enter without having to scale the fences. However, the court reversed the grant of summary judgment because questions of fact remained regarding whether the Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.190(6) exception for willful or malicious failure to guard or warn of a dangerous condition applied. The court noted that willful could include acting with indifference to the natural consequences.

Defendant was convicted, and the trial court sentenced him to 10 years. On appeal, defendant argued that the statute imposed strict liability because it did not require that he possess a mental state. Alternatively, defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional as overbroad and vague because it potentially applied to conduct that was not prohibited. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court found that &sect; 508.025(1)(b) required that a prison inmate inflict physical injury upon an employee of the detention center. Thus, the statute necessarily contained within it the element that a prison inmate intentionally or wantonly inflict such injury. Further, &sect; 508.025(1)(b) was not void for being overbroad because it did not prohibit any constitutionally permissible conduct. Further, the statute was not void for vagueness because it applied to the unique situation within prisons and provided the minimal guidelines necessary to govern law enforcement.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that under Ky. Rev. Stat.

Additionally, no certificate of environmental compatibility was required under Ky. Rev. Stat.

Finally, the provisions of the condemnation statute were not unconstitutional and the power of condemnation had been lawfully delegated to the power company pursuant to Ky.

The trial court entered judgment for the truck driver. The driver and his wife alleged that the trial court erred in denying their motion for a directed verdict, in directing the jury that the driver's medical bills were paid by a collateral source, and in not instructing the jury on the sudden emergency doctrine. In affirming the decision, the court found that the driver and his wife were not entitled to a directed verdict. There was evidence that the driver was not keeping a proper lookout and the truck driver did not make sudden left turn. The trial court's collateral source instruction was proper under Ky. Rev. Stat.

The court held that: (1) a subject foreign to the title of an act, under Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners attempted to prevent surface mining on the property. Subsequently, the previous owner signed an agreement permitting the hauling of coal mined from adjoining tracts. The previous owner identified himself as the owner. The trial court characterized a 1903 deed as a broad form deed, granting rights to the mineral owners. It contained a waiver of damages clause. The court found that since the right to control the surface passed to the mineral owner in 1903, the previous owner had no rights to reserve. He had only a practice of receiving payment for the use of the surface by the mineral owner or lessee. It was unenforceable and illusory. Thus the previous owner had no right to prohibit surface mining prior to his sale to the owners. No right in the surface owner to limit the method of extracting the mineral was recognized until the ratification of the broad form deed amendment. At that time, the owners had the right to restrict the use of the surface in mining. The court held that the previous owner's attempted reservation of surface royalties for use of the surface was of no effect because of the operation of the 1903 deed and the subsequent ratification of the amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sought review of a judgment from the Bell Circuit Court (Kentucky), which dismissed, for lack of timeliness, appellants' motion to intervene in an action that ultimately resulted in appellee county's imposition of a tax on appellants to pay the debts of appellee refuse disposal district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1984, after a receiver was appointed for appellee refuse disposal district, appellee bank was granted a default judgment in an action against appellee refuse disposal district to recover loan proceeds. Thereafter, appellee refuse disposal district filed for bankruptcy, but bankruptcy was rejected on the ground that appellee refuse disposal district had taxing authority to satisfy its debts. In 1989, the circuit court ordered appellee county to satisfy appellee bank's default judgment through a tax levy, whereupon appellant taxpayers moved to intervene, claiming the debts had violated the &quot;pay as you go&quot; plan of public financing established in Ky. Const. &sect; 157. Following the motion's dismissal for lack of timeliness, review was sought, and the court reversed. Noting the equitable nature of taxpayer actions, the court held the doctrine of laches had not barred intervention because the 1984 litigation had been insufficient to put appellants on notice of an unconstitutional public indebtedness. The court also held the 1984 judgment had not been res judicata because the receiver, who had refused to defend against the judgment, had not adequately represented appellants' interests.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 177.830-177.890, as it read in 1981.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that the sole issue raised was whether an amendment to the Billboard Act enacted by the General Assembly in 1990 as House Bill No. 816 changing the definition of &quot;urban area&quot; should be given retroactive effect so as to authorize the continued prosecution of these actions which were begun under the Billboard Act before the 1990 amendments. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 446.080(1) provided that no statute was to be construed to be retroactive, unless expressly so stated. The court found nothing in House Bill 816 which expressly stated that the new definition of &quot;urban area&quot; was to have be retroactively applied to a situation where penalties were sought for actions which took place in 1981 and which were then illegal based upon a definition which the Kentucky Supreme Court subsequently found to be unconstitutionally vague. Thus, the court affirmed the judgments of the trial courts dismissing the actions.</SPAN></P>

The treasurer had been replaced at the expiration of his term.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The treasurer was appointed to his position for the county, but when his regular term expired, the fiscal court appointed a replacement. The treasurer objected, expressing that he had fully expected to continue in his position after his current term. The next day, the county attorney officially notified him that he was to prepare all accounts and make a settlement with the fiscal court. The treasurer filed an action for reinstatement, demanding that he be allowed to continue in his position until just cause was found for dismissal or he resigned. He moved for summary judgment. The motion was granted, and appellants sought review. The court reversed, with directions for the trial court to enter summary judgment in favor of appellants. The appointive process mandated by law constituted a permissive form of patronage. The treasurer was a high-level officer of county government, and case law did not mandate that he be reappointed by reason of preference or otherwise. The refusal to reappoint him and instead made a patronage appointment of his replacement was consistent with Kentucky law, and the fiscal court's actions were consistent with federal precedent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicant appealed from a summary judgment of the Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) dismissing his complaint for injunctive relief and damages for employment discrimination against defendant corrections cabinet and others. He alleged constitutional and civil rights violations under both state and federal law. The complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim and it was found to be time-barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicant, a corrections cabinet, alleged discrimination under state and federal law against the corrections cabinet and others after he was disqualified under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 196.037, 61.300(3) from holding a peace officer position, for which he applied, because he had a prior felony conviction. The lower court found his claims time-barred and that he failed to state a claim. The court of appeals reversed on the time-limitations issue. The claims were not totally barred by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 413.140(1)(a), 344.450. The applicant's disqualification for a peace officer position in 1983 was a discrete act, but one which was repeated in 1986 and 1990. Thus the filing period for a claim began anew each time he applied for the same position and was rejected for the same reasons. The court affirmed on the merits that the complaint failed to state an actionable claim for discrimination, as &sect; 61.300 or &sect; 196.037 applied to all former felons, regardless of race, and there was no established protected class involving persons with felony records. The court further declined to find &sect; 61.300 or &sect; 196.037&nbsp;unconstitutional, facially or as applied to the applicant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court erred as a matter of law in holding that plaintiff applicant's 1990 claims and 1986 claims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations. The judgment in the applicant's action, against defendant corrections cabinet and others for discrimination, was otherwise affirmed. The applicant failed to state an actionable claim as the disqualifying statute applied to all former felons, and they were not a protected class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customers had lost money when the broker's actions caused a property on which the customers were building a home to be foreclosed upon by a mortgagee.

The court disagreed and affirmed the decision of the circuit court. The court agreed that the hearing officer specifically found that the broker violated Ky. Rev.

Further, the court agreed that the broker violated 201 Ky. Admin.

The court ruled that the commission's findings of fact were amply supported by the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board resolved to levy taxes sufficient to obtain full funding. The board decided to employ both property and utility gross receipts license taxes. After the tax was levied, the taxpayers successfully sought a levy recall election. On appeal, the school board argued that the trial court's interpretation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 160.470(12), 157.440(1), and 160.597 was flawed in light of caselaw. The court found that the tax levied by the school board was authorized by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 160.613, 160.614. Thus, facially, the recall procedure contained in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 160.597 was applicable unless the &quot;notwithstanding&quot; provisions in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 160.470(12)(a) and 157.440(1)(a) removed taxes levied according to those statutes from the recall procedure.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, appellant Revenue Cabinet of the Commonwealth of Kentucky sought review of orders from the Franklin County Circuit Court (Kentucky), which awarded costs and attorneys fees to appellee claimants in their successful class action challenging the constitutionality of the statute relating to a tax on unmined coal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants, in a consolidated class action, filed suit against government officials, challenging the constitutionality of the statute relating to a tax on unmined coal. After the trial court awarded costs and attorneys fees to the claimants following success on the merits, the revenue cabinet sought review. The court reversed to the extent of an enhancement and remanded for a re-calculation of the award absent a multiplier. The excessiveness of the award was attributable to the multiplier applied by the trial court. This was a clear abuse of discretion as there was no authority for this type of enhancement in Kentucky. The court affirmed the award. The trial court correctly relied on Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 453.260 in justifying the award. The court could not say that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys fees and costs to the appellees. The statute limited the award to $ 10,000 to each party. The case was a class action in which the members of the class consisted of potentially every taxpayer in the state of Kentucky. Each class member was considered a party. That being so, the award was well within the $ 10,000 per party limit.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because the highest FVC value and the highest FEV1 value exceeded 80 percent of predicted, the employee was limited to retraining incentive benefits pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.732(1)(a). Given the undisputed facts of this case, together with the language of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.732(2), the court held that benefits should properly have been awarded pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.732(1)(a) not &sect; 342.732(1)(b). The determination that he employee had a 75 percent respiratory impairment was contrary to the medical evidence and the statutory mandate that the highest FVC or FEV1 value be utilized in determining and establishing the impairment. Regardless of the category of testing utilized by the ALJ, the medical evidence in this case required a finding of greater than 80 percent of the predicted value, since the highest values in both the FVC and FEV1 test categories exceeded 80 percent of predicted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's last exposure to asbestos was on or around November 1, 1976.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316(3) applied to asbestos-related claims filed on or after July 15, 1986. The court agreed with the employee's claim. The court ruled that the employee was entitled to compensation because the clear language of &sect; 342.316(3) granted it to him, and because the clear and unambiguous language of Ky. Rev. Stat.

Further, the court noted that the Consumer Protection Act had been previously found constitutional. Finally, the court found that the circuit court's order of restitution against the corporation did not violate the Contracts Clause of the United States Constitution, because any contract induced by unfair, false, misleading acts or practices was is no contract, ab initio, and therefore not protected by the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 132.020(11), 132.220 as opposed to the method of taxation provided for in &sect; 132.487.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governmental subdivisions contended that they had the right to tax automobiles held for sale, but never registered in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The trial court ruled in favor of the dealerships. The court affirmed the judgment. No tax was to be levied on vehicles until they were registered and, if that resulted in eliminating the taxation of those that were in inventory as of the assessment date, then so be it because the General Assembly had provided an alternative time of assessment. The taxing scheme was not unconstitutional under Ky. Const. &sect; 171. Although the statutes exempted dealers who held vehicles for resale from payment of the tax, this was not a &quot;halving&quot; of a classification. It was only a method of fixing the time and the person responsible for payment of the ad valorem tax on all motor vehicles. Section 171 empowered the General Assembly to divide property into classes and to determine what class or classes would be subject to local taxation. The court had no authority to entertain the subdivisions' counterclaims for the assessment of ad valorem taxes on the dealerships' new and used cars for prior years.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the circuit court erred in failing to provide a psychiatric examination, in denying his motion for a continuance, and failing to permit him to introduce statistics on denial of parole at the sentencing phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that despite the mandatory language of Ky. Rev. Stat.

P. 8.06 to have him examined for mental competency. The court found that defendant failed to file written notice of his intention to introduce evidence of mental illness or insanity at the time of the offense at least 20 days before trial. The court held that defendant's prior suicide attempt and his six-month long psychiatric evaluation, coupled with his counsel's representations, were sufficient under Rule 8.06 and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 504.100 to have required postponement of trial until the issue of defendant's capacity to stand trial could have been determined. The court held that such a determination could have been made only after a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist examined defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged a judgment from the Henderson Circuit Court (Kentucky), which determined that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.135 barred the employee's personal injury claim against appellees, manufacturers, installer, and owners. Appellees contended that they were entitled to summary judgment. The employee contended that she was injured from emissions of carbon monoxide over an extended period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for a hospital for a number of years as a medical technologist. The owners contracted with the installer to put in an exhaust vent fan system for the laboratory where the employee worked. The employee asserted that the manufacturers supplied the system in an unreasonably dangerous condition, that the installer negligently selected and put in the system, and that the owner failed to exercise reasonable care for persons lawfully on the premises. The sole issue on appeal was the constitutionality of &sect; 413.135. The court noted that if the statute was constitutional it would bar the employee's claim because suit was not filed until more than seven years after installation. The court found that the statute violated Ky. Const. &sect; 51. The court observed that the statute was unconstitutional because its title concealed more than it revealed the nature of the act. The court pointed out that the statute was not a traditional statute of limitations, which cut off actions after they accrued, but rather a statute of repose, which served to extinguish actions before they even arose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, guardian ad litem for the unknown heirs, two groups of putative heirs, and civic organization, each appealed the decision of the Kenton Circuit Court (Kentucky), which held for appellees, city, trust company, and others, finding that heirs had no right, title, and interest in a park because the deed retained to the donor family a right of re-entry, rather than reverter, and that restrictions in deed were in essence void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision that original deed to the city did not create a possibility of reverter because it was not expressly stated or inescapably implied that there was a right of reverter. The deed as a whole provided for a right of re-entry upon condition broken. The Kentucky Perpetuities Act of 1960, specifically Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 381.218 through 381.223, made any right of entry invalid at the time of the trial, as no re-entry had been exercised by the donor's heirs, and no declaration of intention to preserve that right had been filed for record with the county clerk. The court reversed the decision to set aside the original restrictions, finding that it was error to set these restrictions aside in a wholesale manner. The donor had the right to impose on the gift any condition so long as it was not against public policy. The court instructed the trial court on remand to determine which, if any of the conditions, were either against public policy, or which usages of the property would conform to the restrictions but still be convenient and comfortable, according to changed conditions, without violating the conforming use doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part the decision that the deed did not create the possibility of reverter, and reversed in part the decision that set aside the deed restriction in a wholesale manner. The court remanded for the trial court to consider the deed restrictions and conditions to determine if they conformed to public policy or whether there were changed circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The summary judgment dismissed the racetrack operator's complaint that challenged the constitutionality of statutory provisions that regulated intertrack wagering and the simulcasting of horse races.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees intervened as defendants in the racetrack operator's action to challenge the constitutionality of statutory provisions that regulated intertrack wagering and the simulcasting of horse races. The trial court overruled the racetrack operator's motion for summary judgment, granted appellees' motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court reversed the summary judgment against the racetrack operator. The court determined that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 230.377(5) was unconstitutional under Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 59, 60. The court found that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 230.377(5) provided an exclusive right of first refusal for simulcasting for the county in question than was imposed on tracks that were located in other counties in the state. The court concluded that there was no justification for treating the county differently than any other county and that there was no reasonable basis for the county's classification. The court found that Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 230.377 remained enforceable to the extent that it authorized simulcasting and placed its regulation and administration under the jurisdiction of an appropriate state racing commission.</SPAN></P>

He filed an action alleging that his house had been constructed in a negligent, defective and unworkmanlike manner. Builder defended, claiming that the action was statutorily barred, and the trial court granted summary judgment dismissing the action. On appeal, the court held that even though the defects might have been latent for more than seven years, the action was barred by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.135, noting that this statute, as amended, no longer violated the constitution because it now applied to all persons within the class covered by the statute. As such, there was no longer any distinction made between those who provided goods and those who provided services. Hence, the statute could be constitutionally applied to this action. Further, the title to the statute adequately set forth the subject of the act. As such, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment for the builder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The findings against the licensee stemmed from a complaint issued by the board's executive director.

The board's decision that the licensee violated its code of professional practice and conduct was also affirmed. The license suspension was for a period of five years. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded with directions that the license be reinstated. The court stated that the board's minimum standards of practice were not effective until September 10, 1985, and three of the five findings against the licensee concerned plats that were completed prior to that date. The court held that it was improper for the board to apply its regulations retroactively against the licensee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four times a year, the pharmacist sold his excess drugs to a wholesaler. Included in these sales were birth control pills, the invoices for which were stamped by the manufacturer, &quot;For clinic use only. This merchandise is not intended for resale or distribution.&quot; As a result, the Board found that the pharmacist had violated Ky. Rev. Stat.

The Board therefore suspended the pharmacist's license. The circuit court affirmed the Board's decision. On appeal, the court reversed the Board's findings and conclusions. The court held that the Board erred in disciplining the pharmacist under the statutes pertaining to manufacturers and wholesalers, as, by definition, he was neither a manufacturer nor wholesaler. The court further held that there was no evidence in support of the Board's finding that the public was being, or was likely to be, deceived, defrauded, or harmed by the resale of birth control pills. Hence, the pharmacist's actions vis a vis the birth control pills did not amount to unprofessional conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board member argued that &sect; 160.180 was unconstitutional because it did not state the penalty. The court stated that although &sect; 160.180 did not specifically state the penalty to be given, the penalty could be determined from the statute as a whole. Therefore, the court held that the statute was not unconstitutional. The board member also argued that the Commonwealth was estopped from bringing the ouster action because it waited 26 months to initiate it. The court maintained that acts invoking under the estoppel doctrine must have resulted in prejudice. Prejudicial acts complained of by the board member included the inability of witnesses to recall a board meeting, which allegedly affected his defense. The court noted that the board minutes clearly indicated that the board member voted for his relative. Therefore, no prejudice to the board member was shown. The board member also argued that the Commonwealth failed to amend its complaint to include his new term in office. The court noted that the complaint attempted to oust defendant from his original term. The trial court disqualified the board member for actions that occurred one year into his first term, so there was no error.</SPAN></P>

The circuit judge found no violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 95.015 and 61.310(4). The court also had no difficulty harmonizing the local ordinance with the statutory framework. The fact that it imposed more stringent guidelines as to off-duty work did not, in and of itself, pose constitutionality problems. The additional limitations were reasonable and rationally related to the end sought to be accomplished. The ordinance did restrict, by placing certain limitations upon, the right of the officers to serve as policemen, and these limitations were not unlawful. The city had a legitimate interest in preserving public trust and confidence in its police force, and to that end requiring them to refrain from working in environments, which could lead to conflicts with their official duties, could not be considered unreasonable. The officer had not been deprived of any constitutional right, and therefore the guarantees of due process and equal protection did not come into play.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the prisoner was returned to prison for a new conviction and not because he violated a technical condition of his parole. Therefore, he was not entitled to a final revocation hearing because his loss of liberty derived not from a parole violation warrant, but from his subsequent conviction. Affirming the denial of his petition for habeas relief, the court concluded that there was no need for a preliminary hearing because the subsequent criminal conviction conclusively established the parole violation and the prisoner was not eligible for parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant's counsel's request for attorney fees was approved by the ALJ. Pursuant to &sect; 342.320(2)(c), the Special Fund was required to pay its portion of the fee in a lump sum and to deduct the amount of the fee from the weekly benefits payable to the claimant in equal installments over the duration of the award or until the amount of fees was recouped. In paying the fees, the Special Fund deducted from the claimant's award a lump-sum attorney fee discount in addition to the deduction for the fee itself. The claimant asserted that the Special Fund was not entitled to take into account the present value of future payments and deduct the discount. The ALJ agreed. The Board affirmed on the ground that no discount was provided under &sect; 342.320(2)(c), which provided the third method of paying attorney fees under &sect; 342.320(2). The court affirmed, finding that, because the Kentucky Legislature omitted to provide in &sect; 342.320(2)(c) for the &quot;commuting&quot; of funds, i.e., a discount, unlike that provided in &sect; 342.320(2)(a), the court could not read into the statute what it believed to be equitable when the statute was clear on its face.</SPAN></P>

The inmate filed a complaint with the Board for negligence, and the Board entered an order dismissing the claim on the grounds that there was no negligence. The inmate requested a hearing, and the Board dismissed the claim. He challenged the dismissal to the circuit court, which dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. Affirming, the court held that creation of the Board afforded the inmate with a hearing, even though the results were not to his liking. The court found that the original cause was vested in the Board, which was not a court. The court ruled that Ky.

On review, the court found no prejudice to the wife's rights under Ky. R. Crim. P. 16 when some amendments to the original indictment were made. She did not persuade the court that she should have been granted a directed verdict on based on a lack of a legal duty to prevent a child's rape or that her actions were nothing more than benign neglect. The court found that the evidence was to the contrary. The court also affirmed her husband's conviction. The court rejected his claim that he was having hallucinations when he made a confession or that he was not liable for the criminal offenses.

The district court had declared Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 510.100 to be violative of the Kentucky Constitution and dismissed the charge of criminal solicitation of sodomy in the fourth degree against the accused.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court declined to reach the merits of the constitutional challenge, but rather dismissed the appeal on the grounds that it was procedurally improper because prior approval from the Attorney General was not obtained. The court noted that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22A.020(4)(b) specifically stated that criminal cases appealed to the circuit court were to be taken in the manner provided by the rules, except that the record on appeal was to be transmitted to the Attorney General, who was to determine that review by the court of appeals was important to the correct and uniform administration of the law. The court held that the Attorney General's role in reviewing appeals before they were docketed in the court of appeals was a purely administrative act designed to eliminate frivolous, vexatious, or meritless appeals. Therefore, because the Attorney General's role was purely administrative and because of the constitutional right of both parties to have an appeal pursuant to Ky. Const. &sect; 115, the exercise of judicial responsibility was not dependent upon who the prosecutor was, and it was error for the circuit court to dismiss the appeal on procedural grounds.</SPAN></P>

She brought an action against the university hospital and its physicians. The hospital was owned by the commonwealth but was operated by an agency, which utilized the hospital to provide practical training for students. Her action against the physicians was dismissed on grounds of sovereign immunity and lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the Kentucky Board of Claims Act, Ky. Rev. Stat.

The court held that the physicians in the university hospital had no special protection by means of sovereign immunity because &sect; 44.070, which purported to extend sovereign immunity to the personal liability of the its employees, violated the state constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county fiscal court determined that a number of county roadways were in need of significant repair.

The taxpayer alleged that the arrangement violated &sect; 157, which prohibited a county from becoming indebted in an amount in excess of its annual budget. In affirming the trial court's order that dismissed the taxpayer's action, the court ruled that because the county could not be held responsible for the debt incurred by the corporation, it circumvented the constitutional prohibition of &sect; 157.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents contended that a service charge imposed by the MSD to fund a comprehensive storm water drainage system was actually a tax that the MSD had no authority to impose. The residents contended that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment, by holding the service charge was not a tax, by holding that the charge did not violate Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 76.090 and by failing to certify the class action. On appeal, the court disagreed with all of the resident's contentions and affirmed. Summary judgment was proper because the only crucial issue was whether the service charge was a tax. Kentucky's Supreme Court had previously held that the legislative act that created the MSD was constitutional and that charges for sewer service were not taxes. The court found that reasoning applied to the MSD's responsibilities for drainage as well, pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 76.080 and 76.100. The service charge did not violate the equal protection provision of the Constitution because the charges were based on a reasonable and rational classification that was uniform for all residential property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under 605 Ky. Admin. Regs. 1:150, the commission attempted to regulate the sales of vehicles by established dealers that occurred at temporary or off-site locations. Off-site sales of motor vehicles were increasingly common where dealers joined forces and held sales at a location away from their usual places of business. The regulation restricted off-site sales by requiring that the sales occur in the same municipality as the dealer's place of business and by authorizing the discretion of the commission to grant or deny temporary sales location permits. The circuit court issued a permanent injunction barring the enforcement of the regulation. The circuit court found that the regulation's stated purpose was not its true purpose. Rather, the regulation was anti-competitive in nature. The regulation greatly affected the sales of car rental agencies of their used car fleets. Pursuant to the Ky. Const., &sect; 2, the legislature could not arbitrarily interfere with private business or prohibit lawful occupation. The court agreed with the conclusion of the circuit court that the commission had no legitimate basis for promulgating the regulation in question.</SPAN></P>

The court also stated that &sect; 177.841(2) specifically provided for certain signs recognizing the need for using certain advertising devices and directional signs.

The word &quot;shall&quot; in Rule 24.03 imposed a mandatory burden upon the party challenging the constitutionality of a statute to notify the Attorney General of the challenge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Air Pollution Control District of Jefferson County (APCD), appealed an order of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky), which held that &sect; 7 of District Regulation 8 providing for the payment of a $ 6 mandatory testing fee under the Vehicle Emissions Testing Program was unconstitutional. Appellee citizens cross-appealed the order insofar as it did not find the entire regulation unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislative body of a county activated the APCD in 1952. The APCD promulgated on January 5, 1983, a Regulation 8 creating a Vehicle Exhaust Testing Program (VET) for the county. Section 7 thereof required the owner of each vehicle to pay an inspection fee to the private contractor who performed the required inspection. In a citizens' action, the trial court held that &sect; 7 was unconstitutional but that the remainder of Regulation 8 was constitutional. On appeal by both parties, the court held that &sect; 7 was also constitutional. In so ruling, the court stated that Regulation 8 and its VET program amounted to a reasonable exercise of the APCD's extensive power to prevent and reduce air pollution. Ken. Rev. Stat. ch. 77, construed as a whole, was sufficiently broad enough to confer such power on the APCD. Section 7's exemptions for vehicles that could not brought into compliance with the regulation without costing in excess of certain specified sums and for non-residents did not violate equal protection. The fact that the fee charged for testing included a profit to the private contractor did not violate Ken. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77.205.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order on the appeal by the APCD and affirmed it on the appeal by the citizens.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant's term as a county judge/executive, disagreements arose between himself and the county attorney. While presiding over two fiscal court meetings, defendant made false accusations against the county attorney. Defendant first argued that his statements were personal in nature and not official acts. The court disagreed and held that defendant's verbal attacks were launched during fiscal court meetings while he was presiding as county judge/executive. While the statements were personal in nature they were made at a public meeting. Defendant also contended that the State failed to introduce any evidence that he knew he was committing a legal wrong in making his statements. The court decided that the evidence demonstrated that defendant knew he was acting as the presiding officer of the fiscal court and that knowledge was sufficient for conviction. Defendant next asserted that the jury instructions were erroneous but the court determined that the instructions, when read in combination, fully explained the law. Finally, the court held that there was no First Amendment or due process violation, the speech was not protected, and the evidence was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the father's motion for discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1971, appellee mother gave birth to a child out of wedlock. In 1984, the mother instituted a paternity action against the father. The father pleaded the statute of limitations and laches as a defense, but later acknowledged his paternity and agreed to pay $ 35 a week in support commencing March 1986. The trial court granted the mother's motion for arrearages from the child's date of birth, totaling $ 21,327. The circuit court affirmed the order, finding that the father failed to affirmatively plead laches below. The court reversed, finding that the defense of laches was affirmatively set forth in the father's answer and sufficiently raised as a defense at the hearing for arrearages. Further, although Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 406.031 did not apply retroactively, it was essentially a codification of the common law doctrine of laches. Therefore, laches was a valid defense in the paternity action seeking past support and it was inequitable to allow the mother to receive arrearages for all of the years when no steps were taken to determine paternity.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) the class of first time registrants was not a suspect class; (2) defendant had no fundamental constitutional right to receive notice of the statutory provisions governing financial responsibility for motor vehicle registrants; (3) the state had a legitimate interest in furthering financial responsibility for torts committed with motor vehicles; and (4) defendant failed to demonstrate that he was subjected to invidious discrimination by the provisions of Ky.

The trial court upheld the cabinet's order. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that the cabinet did not set forth specific and sufficient findings of fact. A finding which consisted of nothing other than a repetition of the legal requirements as set out by a statute failed to meet the requirements of due process. The finding did not contain sufficient adjudicative facts to permit a court to conduct a meaningful review of the proceeding to determine the question of whether the action of the commission had or had not been arbitrary. The only evidence reviewed by the hearing officer and adopted in the final order was the proposed penalty assessment. The cabinet's findings were a mere restatement of the legal requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action arose out of a complaint that the advertisers were maintaining commercial billboards within view of an interstate highway in violation of Ky.

Stat. &sect; 177.841(2) was enforced by the Department of Highways in an unconstitutional manner The court held that the general assembly's power to regulate billboards was within its police power. The court also held that there was no evidence to support the conclusion that &sect; 177.841(2) was enforced in an unconstitutional manner because &sect; 177.841(2) was enforced statewide in every highway district in which it could have been applied, there was no indication that the advertisers were singled out for enforcement or that others in the same class were allowed to remain in violation of the law. The court noted that the only billboards in the advertisers' district that remained in violation of &sect; 177.841(2) were those owned by the advertisers. The court stated that the mere fact that a higher percentage of legal actions were prosecuted in some districts than in others did not amount to selective enforcement.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reduced the interest rates on the judgments from the higher rates on the notes to the rate specified in Ky. Rev.

The creditor contended that the judgment interest should have been set at the note's rate of interest through maturity and beyond. The court held that the judgment interest rates should have been set at the rates stated in the notes. The court also held that the exception for written obligations in &sect; 360.040 was constitutional because the exception applied equally to all persons who entered into written obligations containing interest accrual rates and the exception was necessary for &sect; 360.040 to comply with the contracts clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movants desired to place advertising signs along a freeway in the county. Although the movants were legally qualified to erect the signs, the responsible county officials initially declined to issue the required permits because of action pending before the fiscal court, which sought to amend the applicable ordinances. When the new ordinances were passed, movants were prohibited from obtaining the permits for their signs at the desired locations. The circuit court refused to issue a temporary injunction requiring the county to allow the signs to be erected, but on appeal, the court granted movants relief from the circuit court judgment. The court held that the fiscal court could not amend the ordinance by resolution because only an ordinance could amend and ordinance. Movants were legally entitled to have their permits issued, but the permits were denied through resolutions that were illegal. Consequently, the circuit court abused its discretion in failing to grant movants' request for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to the charges of making harassing communications in order to test the constitutionality of &sect; 525.080. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment that affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant, and upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 525.080. The court held that the difference between &sect; 525.080 and Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 525.070 was the manner in which the harassment occurred, which was the factor that insulated Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 525.080 from being unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 525.080 did not concern face-to-face communications in a public place, but rather related to a person's right to privacy. The court determined that the fact that &sect; 525.080 was not limited to &quot;fighting words&quot; did not render it overbroad because that phrase had no bearing on &sect; 525.080. Further, the statute was neither overbroad nor did it prohibit legitimate free speech. Rather, &sect; 525.080 controlled the manner that was used that intruded on an individual's right to be left alone and not the thoughts or ideas that were conveyed. The court held that the meaning of &sect; 525.080 was clear and it provided a reasonable opportunity to know what actions were prohibited.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that after review of the statute, there was no expression of a legislative intent to create a crime of failure to utilize emergency equipment.

The decedent died and left appellee estate consisting of 48 percent farm land with the balance composed of stocks, bonds, cash, and a pickup truck. The revenue cabinet determined that the estate did not qualify for the agricultural evaluation so it assessed at fair cash value and issued a tax deficiency. The court observed that estates where the farm land's fair cash value exceeded 50 percent of the gross taxable estate were assessed on an agricultural basis while, where they did not, the property was assessed at the fair cash value. Because each class was taxed equally, and the legislature had not acted arbitrarily, the law was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only evidence linking defendant to a break-in at a dental office was a fingerprint obtained off of a pane of glass from the broken window in the office.

The officer who took the original fingerprints did not testify at trial and there was no direct evidence that defendant was the person whose fingerprints were on the card. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court and found that the custodian of the records should not have been permitted to testify. The court reasoned that the testimony regarding the identification made pursuant to the fingerprint card was prejudicial as hearsay and was a violation of defendant's constitutional right of confrontation as provided in U.S. Const. amend.

The property owners appealed and the plumbing company moved the court to dismiss the appeal. The court denied the motion to dismiss the property owners' appeal. The court held that although the rule provided the movant was to serve notice, the statute was silent but indicated service was a function of the court. The court found that remand was not appropriate under the circumstances of the case as (1) the plumbing company had not demonstrated how it had been prejudiced by the property owners' failure to notify the attorney general, (2) having failed to raise the issue of noncompliance in the trial court, it waived the right to object and, (3) the appeal would probably be resolved on grounds other than constitutional ones.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney challenged an order from the McCracken Circuit Court (Kentucky), which sanctioned him pursuant to Ky. R. Civ. P. 11 for his filing of a motion to vacate the circuit court's judgments, which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee Department of Housing and Urban Development and ordered a judicial sale. The attorney argued that the judgments were erroneous on the record because they did not dispose of his client's claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bank filed a mortgage foreclosure action against the attorney's client. The Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was named an additional defendant because it had a second mortgage on the property. The attorney averred numerous affirmative defenses to the complaint, alleging violations of federal and state laws protecting consumers. The bank and HUD filed a joint motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. HUD sought to sanction the attorney, alleging that his motion to vacate the orders violated Ky. R. Civ. P. 11. The trial court granted the sanction. The court reversed. It found that the attorney's motion to vacate objected to the summary judgment and order of sale because the trial court did not pass upon his legal arguments. The court observed that the order granting summary judgment made no ruling that the bank and HUD were entitled to judgment as a matter of law, so the order on its face was fatally defective under Ky. R. Civ. P. 56.03 and the attorney did not violate Ky. R. Civ. P. 11. The court held the motion to vacate was warranted by existing law, was not interposed for an improper purpose, and the order imposing sanctions was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to entry of the judgment, the ex-husband argued that venue was improper to exercise jurisdiction. The ex-husband contended that three factors relevant to determining jurisdiction when competing forums were available - the county of the parties' marital residence prior to separation; the usual residence of the children; and the accessibility of witnesses and the economy of offering proof - did not support the trial court's exercise of jurisdiction. On review, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that state law allowed actions to be brought where either party resided, and noted that the ex-wife resided in the trial court's jurisdiction. The court then held that, despite the relevancy of the factors raised by the ex-husband, the ultimate decision of whether to exercise jurisdiction rested within the trial court's discretion and the trial court did not abuse that discretion. The court noted that the trial court granted the-husband's motion to take testimony of witnesses in the other forum in order to reduce inconvenience and expense. However, the ex-husband did not take advantage of this opportunity.</SPAN></P>

Appellants brought an action against the taxpayers for delinquent real estate taxes, and a judgment and order of sale of the property of the taxpayers were entered. The taxpayers paid the monies to prevent the sale, and then the court reversed the original judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the original judgment and order of sale had been entered by the circuit court, the court had reversed the judgment with directions to the circuit court to dismiss the complaint. The basis for the reversal in the first appeal had been that the governmental bodies had not strictly complied with the revenue statutes in maintaining the action. After the circuit court vacated its original judgment and dismissed the complaint, the taxpayers filed a motion for an order of restitution in which they sought the refund of the monies they had paid to prevent the sale, and the circuit court ordered the refund of those monies. The court reversed the order of the refund, holding that the taxpayers were required to strictly comply with Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 134.590 and seek a refund of taxes paid. The original judgment did not change the character of the claim against the taxpayers, which was a claim for due and unpaid taxes. Rather, the judgment was a vehicle for the circuit court to enforce the payment of the taxes. When the taxpayers paid the monies, they were paying their taxes and they had to seek a refund pursuant to &sect; 134.590, so the circuit court could not order the refund itself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order of the circuit court that had required the refund of the monies, and the court remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

Defendant testified that he did not recall any of the events that transpired because he had been rendered unconscious, and on appeal the court reversed his convictions. The court held that the instructions on third-degree assault and resisting arrest did not place him in double jeopardy because the elements to the two offenses were not the same. The court found that under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 508.025 and 508.040, no mitigation was allowed for assaulting a peace officer while under extreme emotional disturbance. However, the court found that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on defendant's culpable mental state, as the jurors should have been instructed that they could find defendant not guilty if they believed that he was unconscious of his acts.</SPAN></P>

He brought an action alleging negligence against, inter alia, the municipality and the community center, both of which were granted summary judgment by the trial court. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.190 entitled the municipality and center to immunity from liability. The court initially noted that although there was a lease between the parties, it was essentially an employment contract pursuant to which the center was paid to manage and oversee the facility, and that they were within the coverage of &sect; 411.190(1)(b). The court held that both parties were entitled to the blanket immunity because the swimmer had not paid a fee at the time of injury, which was an exception to the statute's protection. The fact that fees were charged at some times did not change the result. Additionally, there was no showing of wilful negligence which would have taken the matter out of the statute's coverage.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Authority was entitled to an injunction permanently restraining the Secretary from taking any action to enforce the Prevailing Wage Law against the Fulton County Jail project or any other local jail project financed from the proceeds of the bonds. The court found that &quot;state funds,&quot; as defined in Ken. Rev. Stat. &sect; 446.010(31) did not include bond proceeds, which had always been trust funds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The will of the deceased established two trusts and named the bank as trustee of both. Trust B was a residuary trust and included real estate. The income generated from Trust B was to be paid to the deceased's wife, for life, with all income exceeding her needs to be paid to their two children, the income beneficiaries. The next level of beneficiaries was the heirs of the income beneficiaries, the remaindermen. The will gave the bank the power to sell the entrusted. The purchaser contacted the bank offering to purchase 100 acres. A representative of the bank's trust department contacted the income beneficiaries to determine if they wanted to sell the land. They agreed to sell. An action was filed in the circuit court seeking judicial approval of the sale. The remaindermen resisted the sale. The sale was approved and the court reversed. The court ordered the land sold at a public auction and held that the facts manifested a breach of duty by the bank to not only the remaindermen, but to the income beneficiaries as well. Further, a conflict of interest existed which should have precluded judicial approval of the sale because the purchaser was a substantial customer of the bank.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant administratrix challenged the judgment from the Bourbon County Circuit Court (Kentucky), which entered summary judgment and dismissed part of an amended final judgment in favor of defendants, construction companies and football coach, in a wrongful death action filed by a student athlete's estate after he was electrocuted while using a whirlpool bath at his high school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The coach modified the high school's existing whirlpool, resulting in wiring deficiencies which caused the death of a student. On appeal by the administratrix, the court held that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the construction companies based on the five-year statute of limitations of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.135(1), since a recent Kentucky Supreme Court decision held that the statute violated the state constitution. Nevertheless, the administratrix had waived her right to appeal the issue because she failed to raise the issue in the trial court, and she failed to notify the attorney general of her constitutional attack on the statute before judgment, pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 418.075 and Ky. R. Civ. P. 24.03. In addition, the court held that under the facts of the case, the administratrix could not have recovered from the construction companies because there was no proof that their negligence, if any, was a substantial causative factor in the death. Instead, the court held that the administratrix should have been granted a directed verdict against the football coach for his negligence in failing to install a ground fault interrupter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of the construction company after holding that the administratrix had waived her right to appeal the unconstitutionality of a statute. However, regarding the football coach, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case after holding that a directed verdict should have been granted in favor of the administratrix against the football coach for his negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The paternity action was dismissed by the district court on statute of limitations grounds. Before the district court dismissal order was entered, the mother timely filed a notice of appeal and statement of appeal. The father's attorney filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that the attorney was not served copies of the notice or statement of appeal, and that he was unaware of the appeal until the father informed him. The circuit court dismissed the appeal and the mother filed a motion to vacate, which was denied. The mother then filed a motion for discretionary review. The court found that the motion for discretionary review was not timely filed because it was filed later than 30 days after the appeal was dismissed. Thus Ky. R. Civ. P. 76.20(2)(a) required the court to dismiss the action. The mother argued the time for filing a motion for discretionary review should have been extended to include the time for the motion to vacate. The court stated that the civil rules did not provide that the running of time for filing a motion for discretionary review was terminated by the motion to vacate.</SPAN></P>

In sustaining the dismissal, the trial court stated that its review was based on substantial evidence, not whether it agreed with the decision or whether it would have reached a different result. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the trial court's ruling was erroneous because it was based on the wrong standard of review. An amendment to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 95.460(2) required that the case be tried as an original action in the trial court. The court held that the legislature intended to give discharged policemen a right of review substantially greater than the review of administrative tribunals.

Rather, the court determined that the son, as an illegitimate heir, had the same amount of time to claim his rights under the intestacy statute as did a legitimate child.

The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court, and remanded with directions to remand to the board of tax appeals. The court held that the taxpayers were subject to unitary taxation under the Act, because the taxpayers' activities were considered a single unitary business.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sections 189A.070(1), (2) provided for revocation of a person's driver's license when convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other impairing substance. Movants contended that the statute's disparate treatment of drivers under the age of 18 and those over that age offended both the state and federal constitution. Particularly, movants alleged that the statute has created a &quot;suspect classification.&quot; The court rejected movants' arguments and upheld the statute's validity. Automobile drivers under the age of 18 did not constitute a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis. The statute passed the rational basis test. The legislature reasonably regarded minors, person between the ages of 16 and 18, as a class requiring closer supervision. There were distinctive and natural reasons, based upon a consideration of maturity, or rather a lack thereof, for making such a classification. Section 189A.070 did not contravene the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 150.390(2) prohibited individuals from casting any form of illumination on deer or rabbit while in the possession of a weapon that could be used to kill the game. Defendant asserted that the statute was unconstitutional because it was overly broad. The court agreed and reversed. On its face, the statute could be construed to condemn a variety of constitutionally protected conduct. For instance, an individual driving down a public roadway with his lights on fell within the ambit of the statute if he happened to be in possession of a firearm. As the statute was overbroad, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility had an easement across a field where children in the minor's neighborhood played. The utility maintained a transmission tower on the easement for the transmission of electricity over high-voltage wires. There were no fences or any other barriers preventing access to the tower. Despite the presence of warning signs, the minor and his friends climbed the tower and created a platform on the tower with a piece of plywood bracketed by the wires. The minor was injured when electricity arced from the wires and struck him while he was standing on the platform. In the subsequent personal injury action, the trial court entered summary judgment for the utility. On appeal, the court held that: (1) under either Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 381.232 or the common-law trespass rule, the utility was not liable for the minor's injuries because the transmission tower was a dangerous location and the utility had posted obvious warning signs; and (2) the minor's ignorance of the possibility that electricity might arc through the air did not create a hidden dangerous condition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer was assessed taxes by appellee, the State of Kentucky, under Ken. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 141.120(9), which was upheld by the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky). The taxpayer challenged the assessment and the State cross-appealed the judgment that the statute of limitations barred assessment of taxes for another year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether the procedure set forth in &sect; 141.120(9) was an unconstitutional violation of both the Commerce and Due Process Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. On cross-appeal, the issue was whether the circuit court acted correctly in ruling that the State's attempt to assess taxes for the 1973 year was effectively barred by the statute of limitations. The court held that the taxpayer failed to present clear and cogent evidence that the business income generated by it and attributed to the State was out of all appropriate proportion to the business transacted within the State. Although the taxpayer argued that most of its revenue resulted from interstate travel in states other than Kentucky, the record reflected the fact that the taxpayer had its corporate headquarters and corporate domicile in the jurisdiction and both owned and leased real property there. Furthermore, it benefited from workers' compensation and unemployment insurance laws of the State. The court also concurred with the findings of fact of the circuit court that the statute of limitations barred the assessment for the year 1973.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the constitutionality of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 233 entitled &quot;Abatement of Houses of Prostitution.&quot; The appellants argued that the terms &quot;lewdness,&quot; &quot;assignation,&quot; and &quot;prostitution,&quot; were too vague to be constitutionally acceptable. The court held that the definition in the penal code was appropriately relied upon by the trial court in characterizing the conduct at the establishments as prostitution. Regardless of the definition of prostitution elsewhere in state statutes, however, the court did not believe the term &quot;prostitution&quot; was vague. The court held that &quot;prostitution&quot; had meant, for centuries, the commercial gratification of sexual desires. The court held that there was overwhelming evidence of prostitution with respect to the first business, and that the judgment would not be disturbed. The court would have been inclined to hold that the circuit court erred as a matter of law in determining the second business to be a public nuisance. However, as the circuit court in that case did not order the seizure of the fixtures, and as the period for which the club was ordered to be closed had by then expired, the court concluded that the issue was moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court concerning the first business was affirmed. The appeal from the judgment of circuit court which had ordered the closure of the second business was dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>

The board argued that the employee did not have the required status in the full-time position to appeal his dismissal to the board as he had not yet fulfilled the probationary period. The court reversed the judgment that upheld that decision. The court stated that the employee had completed his probationary period when he was hired as a part time employee and it was uncontested that he had worked essentially full-time hours prior to officially being made a full time employee. In addition, when a change was made to provisional full-time, the employee's hours, duties, and responsibilities were not altered from those he was assigned as a part-time employee. The court held that the board's decision was arbitrary because the employee was already working for the state when he became a full time employee doing the same job he had been doing as a part-time employee, therefore the second probationary period did not apply. The court stated that the board had applied a technical requirement of its policies to relieve the employee of his statutory rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the trial for the other three offenses, defendant neither took the witness stand nor offered witness in his own behalf. However, in the opening statement and closing argument, defense counsel claimed that it was defendant's brother who committed the robbery. At the trial of the handgun charge, the same trial counsel indicated in his opening statement that it was defendant's co-indictee who committed the robbery. Defendant testified for himself, stating first that he was riding around aimlessly with the co-indictee and then admitting on cross-examination that he knew a car was to be stolen. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for the handgun charge. The prosecutor questioned defendant concerning his silence at the first trial. The court held that the cross-examination was not a violation of defendant's Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination. The grossly inconsistent defenses presented on defendant's behalf permitted the cross-examination. There was nothing in the policy of the law against self-incrimination that required the extension of immunity to any trial or tribunal other than that in which defendant preserved it by refusing to testify.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that his refusals to be sworn and to testify were protected under the Fifth Amendment, that the sentences were improper, and that he could only have been convicted of one count of contempt rather than two. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court held that it was in the trial court's discretion to determine whether defendant's testimony would have been incriminating. The trial court held an in camera hearing, examined the evidence, and allowed defendant to present his concerns. Thus, the decision that the testimony was not protected was not an abuse of discretion. The duration of the sentences imposed were not erroneous. The trial court was compelled to find Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 421.140&nbsp;unconstitutional as an impermissible limitation on the inherent powers of the courts. Defendant's argument regarding whether the sentences should have been imposed concurrently was not preserved for appeal. The court reversed on defendant's final assertion of error, holding that defendant's two refusals to testify in the same case within a two hour period was considered only one contempt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court dismissed the State's paternity action on behalf of the mother against the father pursuant to Ky.

The circuit court determined that &sect; 406.031 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution because it treated children born out of wedlock differently than marital children. The U.S. Supreme Court had upheld the rights of children born out of wedlock in every facet of the law and ruled that they have been accorded the same rights as marital children.
