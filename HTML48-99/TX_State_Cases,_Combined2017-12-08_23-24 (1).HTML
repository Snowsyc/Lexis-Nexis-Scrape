</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment from the Criminal District Court No. Two of Tarrant County (Texas), which convicted appellant, on a jury verdict, for sexual assault in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.011(a)(2)(A) (1989), and sentenced appellant to prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for sexual assault under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.011(a)(2)(A) (1989). Appellant sought the court's review asserting that &sect; 22.011(a)(2)(A) was unconstitutionally vague, that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on accomplice witness testimony, and by allowing evidence of unadjudicated extraneous offenses under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07 (1993). The court held that a defendant could not successfully challenge a statute for vagueness when it clearly applied to his conduct. Here, the evidence established that appellant penetrated the victim's vagina, conduct which was clearly proscribed by &sect; 22.011(a)(2)(A). Further, because appellant's victim, as a minor, could not legally consent to statutory rape, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.14 (1979), which required corroboration of accomplice testimony, did not apply. Judgment of guilt was therefore affirmed. However, where evidence of unadjudicated extraneous offenses were admitted during the punishment phase of trial, and where the court could not say without a reasonable doubt that error did not contribute to appellant's punishment, judgment of punishment was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

Judgment of punishment reversed and remanded where evidence of unadjudicated extraneous offenses was erroneously admitted during the punishment phase of appellant's trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation sought review of a judgment from the District Court of Travis County (Texas), which dismissed its suit for judicial review of appellee railroad commission's order assessing civil penalties and requiring appellant to plug four oil wells. Dismissal was based on appellant's failure to comply with Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 81.0533(b) (Supp. 1993) requiring prepayment of the penalty as a prerequisite for judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Texas railroad commission ordered appellant corporation to plug four wells and to pay an administrative penalty. Appellant timely complied with all the prerequisites for judicial review of appellee's order except one: appellant failed to make a cash deposit or post bond to cover the penalty assessed, as required by Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 81.0533(b) (Supp. 1993). The trial court dismissed the case based on appellant's failure to comply with &sect; 81.0533(b). On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's ruling and remanded for judicial review of appellee's order. The court held that the prepayment provision of &sect; 81.0533(b) violated the open courts provision of the Texas Constitution, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, by unreasonably restricting access to the courts. The court likewise stuck down the forfeiture provision, Nat. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 81.0533(d) (Supp. 1993). However, the court found that the manner of judicial review set forth in Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 81.0533(e) (Supp. 1993) did not violate appellant's right to a jury trial as guaranteed by Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 15, because judicial review of administrative orders was not constitutionally mandated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Concluding that the penalty-prepayment and forfeiture provisions authorizing the dismissal of appellant corporation's suit were unconstitutional, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for judicial review of appellee railroad commission's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants airport board, joint board of two cities and airlines sought review of the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee cities finding that their local ordinances were not preempted by federal and state law and that appellants did not have the power of eminent domain over them. The court affirmed the judgment. There was no express preemption in the federal legislation of any local control over construction and expansion of major public airports. In addition, the court held that the local law could not be preempted based on safety because safety was not a main concern in expanding the airport. Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration, in approving the project, plainly stated the local ordinances involved were not preempted. In addition, the local ordinances were not preempted by state rules because appellees were home rule cities and there was no legislation limiting appellees authority with regard to the airport expansion. Finally, appellants did not have the power of eminent domain over appellees host cities because appellees power of eminent domain was not preempted with unmistakable clarity in clear and compelling language.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant trespasser belonged to a church group that fed homeless people at a building and a park owned by the City of Forth Worth, Texas. One Sunday the city leased the building and the park to a private for-profit group and the church group was informed that no other group could use the building on that Sunday. Appellant returned to the building on the day of the lease to protest the exclusive use of the park and the ignoring of the plight of the homeless. Appellant was arrested for criminal trespass, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.05 (1989), and asserted that his rights under the U.S. Const. amend. I were violated. The court disagreed and held that the property was a nonpublic forum on the day of the lease because the private for-profit group's use did not embrace any indicia of a traditional public forum. As such, speech could be restricted as long as regulations were reasonable and did not attempt to suppress expression because of appellant's opposition to a speaker's views. The record showed that the trespass statute was applied without discrimination and not for the primary purpose of suppressing appellant's speech; thus it did not violate appellant's rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction of appellant trespasser for criminal trespass. Appellant was denied relief because his freedom of speech rights under the federal constitution had not been violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal before his trial for delivery of a controlled substance filed a pro se application for a writ of habeas corpus that claimed he was denied his right to a speedy trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI. The trial court denied the motion and appellant argued that pre-trial habeas corpus relief was the only appropriate remedy to correct his violation of the speedy trial rule. The court agreed with appellee state that habeas corpus relief was not proper because appellant's adequate remedy at law was by a direct appeal from the denial of a pretrial motion to dismiss, after a trial on the merits. The court stated that a pretrial appeal was not necessary to correct the denial of the right to a speedy trial despite the prolonged delay suffered by appellant. An appellate court reviewing this type of claim was better able to assess the relevant facts after they have been developed in both a pretrial hearing and the trial itself. In light of that, the court dismissed the appeal, holding that the denial of the right to a speedy trial could not be challenged through a pre-trial writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court held that the open court provision served to prevent the legislature from abrogating common-law causes of action only. Appellants sought to recover in wrongful death and survival actions, which were purely statutory. The open courts provision was inapplicable to statutory causes of action; therefore, appellants were bound by the absolute two-year limitations period.</SPAN></P>

Montgomery County (Texas), which entered summary judgments in favor of appellees mother, father, and step-father of the minor child on appellant's claims of negligence and gross negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant minor child was injured when the motorcycle on which she was riding with another crashed. She was riding without a helmet and without permission of appellee mother. Through a next friend, appellant brought suit against appellees for negligence and gross negligence relating to appellant's riding a moped owned by appellees mother and step-father, and failing to provide a helmet for appellant to wear while riding the moped. The court affirmed the trial court's summary judgment in favor of appellees. The court held that parental immunity prohibited the suit against appellees, and that appellant's cause of action did not fall into a recognized exception to the parental immunity doctrine. The court also held that the fact that appellee mother had insurance coverage was not admissible on the issue of her negligence, per Tex. R. Civ. Evid. 411 and Tex. R. Civ. P. 38(c), and the existence of such insurance did not vitiate the parental immunity doctrine. The court also held that appellant failed to demonstrate a breach of any duty owed to appellant, or that appellant's motorcycle accident was foreseeable by appellees, since none gave her permission to ride the motorcycle.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellant failed to plead that the application of the statute of limitations to her would be unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee employee filed grievances seeking back pay for performing functions of a position that paid more than the title he was given. A hearing examiner for appellant city conducted a hearing and concluded that appellee's grievance was fully justifiable. Appellee then requested appellant civil service commission (commission) to review the record. Appellant commission reviewed the record and remanded to the hearing examiner to determine if appellee had performed the work and that if he was performing the work longer than 90 days he was entitled to back pay. The hearing examiner answered that appellee did perform the work. Appellant commission subsequently filed a second ruling that denied appellee back pay. The district court reversed and granted summary judgment in favor of appellee. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held the first order issued by appellant commission was a final order that created a property right. The court found that the fact that the order was conditional did not fail to make it final. The court held the second order of appellant commission defied the finality of its earlier ruling and was entered improperly and without jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that appellant's claim for a stay of the injunction pending review should have been granted, but the failure to grant the stay was not erroneous since it was not reasonably calculated to cause an improper judgment. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because the injunction was not directed to speech, but toward compliance with a zoning ordinance which was content neutral.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that plaintiff had not met the burden of proving that defendant's zoning ordinance was an unreasonable exercise of its police powers where defendant's decision was based upon aesthetic concerns and surrounding property values. The court also held that plaintiff also failed to prove that the junkyard was entitled to be treated as a pre-existing non-conforming use because the use was not lawfully existing at the time that the city first exercised its authority to annex the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent died intestate. Appellant heir, decedent's daughter, was declared sole heir and was granted all of decedent's property. Eight years later, appellee claimant filed a bill of review, claiming to be decedent's illegitimate child. The probate court ordered a new trial to determine whether appellee was decedent's heir. Appellant sought review of the probate court's order, arguing that the probate court erred in retroactively applying a statutory amendment after decedent's death, that the original judgment was voidable and not void, that appellee's claim was barred by the statute of limitations, and that the probate court failed to apply the proper standard for a bill of review. The court reversed the order of the probate court. The court stated that statutes that were in effect at the time of decedent's death were unconstitutional as applied to appellee. Because of this unconstitutionality, however, appellee was entitled to petition the court for a determination of heirship at the time of decedent's death. Since the statute of limitations was four years for contesting heirship, appellee's claim was barred since the claim was filed eight years after the original judgment.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed that that the trial court erred by not granting it a directed verdict on the defense of governmental immunity, by awarding exemplary damages, and that insufficient evidence existed for the submission of evidence to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee former employee was injured on the job while in the employ of appellant municipality. Appellee pursued a workers' compensation claim against appellant, and appellee was subsequently fired. Appellee filed suit against appellant, claiming that under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

Appellant sought review, claiming that it was entitled to governmental immunity, and that the jury erred in awarding exemplary damages to appellee. Appellant also argued that the trial court wrongfully excluded evidence. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8309h a municipality was subject to the provisions of the Texas Workers' Compensation Act and therefore, appellant was not entitled to governmental immunity. The court further held that exemplary damages were properly awarded because appellant engaged in willful and malicious conduct toward appellee, and that remittitur of the exemplary damages was not warranted because appellant's damages were reasonably proportionate to the injury suffered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of judgment to appellee employee. The court held that the workers' compensation act allowed appellee to pursue a cause of action if he was fired for pursuing a workers' compensation claim, and that the workers' compensation act applied to appellant municipality and did not grant it governmental immunity. The court further held that exemplary damages were warranted because appellant acted willfully toward appellant.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was removed from office and he brought suit against appellees. The trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed and found that appellant was not an employee at will because the charter provision stating the judge serve for a length of time decided by the council was limited by statute to a minimum of two years. Although removal was prior to the end of the two-year period, the court held that the charter and ordinances expressly gave appellees the power to appoint the judge, the objective of which was to establish the office and qualifications, and that incidental to that power was the implied power to remove the judge if his performance was unsatisfactory. The court found that a municipal judge of a home-rule city whose position was created by a city did not have the protections of judges of courts established by the constitution or created by the legislature; therefore, appellant was not entitled to a hearing with all the formalities required to remove district court judges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of the offense of theft of property. Appellant sought review of the judgment with seven points of error. Appellant attacked the sufficiency of the indictment arguing that the trial court erred in not quashing the indictment because it failed to allege that the property was appropriated &quot;unlawfully&quot; nor facts necessary to the same conclusion. The complaint arose because the state did not adhere to the accepted practice of following the statute to allege that appellant &quot;unlawfully&quot; appropriated the property. Within the indictment were allegations charging that property in the custody of a law enforcement agency was explicitly represented by a law enforcement agent to appellant as being stolen and he appropriated the property believing it was stolen by another. The court affirmed appellant's conviction. The indictment imparted sufficient notice to appellant that the appropriation alleged was unlawful. Further, because appellant did not explain to the trial court, nor offer a reason on appeal, why the absence of &quot;unlawful&quot; from the indictment impacted his defense, it cannot be said that the claimed notice deficiency prejudiced his substantial rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant church sued appellee city after its building flooded with raw sewage from a sewer line owned and operated by appellee. The trial court granted summary judgment based on appellee's sovereign immunity. The court reversed. Although a municipality was generally immune from liability for its torts in the performance of governmental functions, it could be liable for the creation or maintenance of a nuisance in the course of the non-negligent performance of such functions. If the nuisance was caused by the negligent performance of a governmental function, the municipality was protected from liability because of governmental immunity. Appellant also asserted a cause of action under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 for the taking, damaging or destruction of its property for public use. Because fact questions existed about what caused the backup, whether appellee intentionally or negligently failed to correct the cause of the backup, whether the condition rose to the level of a nuisance, and whether appellee intended to take acts which resulted in the taking, damaging, or destruction of any interest in the property, appellee was not entitled to summary judgment on this cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted murder. The jury affirmatively found that defendant used or exhibited a deadly weapon during the commission of the offense or during immediate flight therefrom and sentenced him to 15 years imprisonment. Pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) (1993), the jury charge was required to include a parole instruction because the judgment contained an affirmative finding of a deadly weapon. Although defendant did not object to the omission of a parole instruction from the charge, on appeal he cited it as error requiring a reversal. The court affirmed. The error was a charge error, not a statutory error. Where defendant did not object to the omission at trial, the appropriate standard on appellate review was whether the error was so egregious and created such harm as to deny defendant a fair and impartial trial. The omitted instruction was intended to benefit the prosecution by increasing the length of sentences, and its omission did not harm defendant. The facts supported the sentence defendant was given, and the error was not so egregious and did not create such harm that defendant was denied a fair and impartial trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court granted summary judgment for appellee City of Cleburne on appellant church's claims for nuisance and for an unconstitutional taking of its property due to a flooding of its building from appellee's sewer. On appeal, the court noted that, generally, a municipality was immune from liability for its torts in the performance of its governmental functions. Appellant argued that its claims for nuisance and for a taking under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 fell within exceptions to the governmental immunity doctrine. The court held that appellee could be liable if the nuisance arose out of its non-negligent performance of its functions. The court indulged every reasonable inference and resolved all doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact in appellant's favor. The court held that, because fact questions existed as to what caused the sewer backup and whether it rose to the level of a nuisance, summary judgment was not proper. Proof of a non-negligent nuisance could provide a basis for recovery for an unconstitutional taking under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. Summary judgment was not proper on that issue, either. The court reversed and remanded for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, city and police chief, challenged a decision from the 200th Judicial District, Travis County (Texas), which found Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.06 (1989), criminalizing private, consensual relations between adults of the same sex, unconstitutional and enjoined appellant city's policy of not hiring lesbian and gay applicants. Appellee job applicant challenged the trial court's order finding that the state was immune from suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee job applicant was denied a job as a police officer because she admitted to being a lesbian during a job interview. Appellee successfully challenged the constitutionality of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.06 (1989), which criminalized consensual relations between adults of the same sex, and obtained an injunction against its enforcement. Appellants, city and police chief, sought review. Appellee challenged the finding that the state was immune from suit in her action. The court found, based on its decision in a 1969 case, that Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 65.011 conferred on the district court jurisdiction to entertain a challenge to the constitutionality of the statute and to grant an injunction against its enforcement. The court also found that the state was immune from suit without its consent, but that a suit seeking relief from a government official's conduct was not one against the state. Finally, the court determined that appellant police chief's claim of qualified immunity was not before the court because that issue related to a claim for damages and not to a claim for injunctive relief. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in all respects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because the trial court had jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of the statute criminalizing consensual relations between adults of the same sex, the injunction was appropriate because appellee job applicant satisfied the two equity requirements for injunctive relief, and, although suit could be brought against a state official, the state was immune from suit without its consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee water district instituted eminent domain proceedings against appellant land owner to acquire a strip of property for a private road. The proceeding was undertaken after appellant refused to convey the right-of-way to appellee. The trial court entered a judgment in which appellee received a fee simple title to the land and appellant received payment. Appellant sought relief from the condemnation. On appeal, the court found that the district court had jurisdiction to review the substantive issues of the case once appellee determined that the taking was necessary to serve the public. This jurisdiction was not lost when the original reason for a condemnation changed as the case was never tried on the theory of a new purpose. The court found that the trial court erred in denying appellant's motion for a new trial as appellant had no power to condemn appellee's strip of property to create a private road, either expressly or by necessary implication, from the statutes defining its eminent domain power; any implication to the contrary arising from the statute would violate Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the pretrial denial by the 371st District Court of Tarrant County (Texas), of appellant's motion for writ of habeas corpus. In his challenge, appellant contended that the statutes, under which he was indicted for investing funds to further the commission of aggravated manufacture of a controlled substance, were unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, indicted for investing funds to further the manufacture of a controlled substance, petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, which the trial court denied. Appellant sought review, arguing that the statutes under which he was charged were unconstitutionally vague because the word &quot;further&quot; was so broad and elastic that it made the same conduct criminal under several sections. The court affirmed the denial, finding that the statutes sufficiently identified the proscribed conduct so as to put appellant on notice of what was forbidden. In affirming, the court overruled appellant's argument that the law was vague because the same conduct would violate more than one provision, finding that different punishments authorized by more than one applicable statute did not detract from the notice of what conduct was proscribed. The court also overruled appellant's argument that he had no notice that financing the purchase of phenylacetic acid was unlawful because that chemical was not a controlled substance, finding that the chemical was a precursor of, and therefore included in the definition of, controlled substance in Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.103(3), (5).</SPAN></P>

Appellants perfected appeals, praying that the court set bail at $ 10,000 under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.15. Subsequently, the state failed to announce readiness to prosecute within 90 days of appellants' indictments, and second writs were filed requesting a personal bond or reducing the amount of bail required, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.151. The trial court again denied habeas corpus relief, and appellants filed second appeals. Upon consolidation of the appeals, the court noted that the state had admitted that it did not announce its readiness to prosecute within the required 90-day period under art. 17.151. Because the state failed to make its proof of a prima facie showing of readiness, art. 17.151 required that appellants be released either on personal bond, or that their bail be reduced to an amount they could afford to pay.

On review sought by appellant, the court affirmed his conviction.

The court held that the state did not need to eliminate every reasonable hypothesis other than guilt to prove the mens rea of the offense. The court concluded that the state established that appellant intentionally or knowingly possessed the cocaine where the evidence showed that appellant was putting his belongings in a bag that also contained the cocaine. The court held that the impact court was a constitutionally permissible extension of the district courts. The court found that appellant failed to object to the fruits of the warrantless search of the athletic bag found near appellant, and thus waived any constitutional error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tax debtor was arrested for possession of more than seven grams of a controlled substance.

Tax Code Ann. &sect; 112.108, which prohibited declaratory judgments as to the constitutionality of a tax assessment absent strict compliance with tax code requirements. The trial court granted appellee's plea and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the order of dismissal, holding that &sect; 112.108 allowed a taxpayer to assail the constitutionality of a tax assessment only upon strict compliance with the statutory requirements of the Tax Code. The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act did not repeal the jurisdictional requirements of the Tax Code; and &sect; 112.108 deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief to a taxpayer, such as appellant, who failed to comply with those jurisdictional requirements.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs made a claim under the policy. Defendant denied the claim, because of an exclusion in the policy for settling damage not caused by plumbing leaks. Plaintiffs brought an action for breach of contract and claims under the Deceptive Trade Practices--Consumer Protection Act (DTPA), Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. &sect; 1741 et seq., and Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.21. The trial court found that defendant was monetarily liable to plaintiffs under the policy. The reviewing court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court found that because defendant failed to timely object to the insufficient notice of the trial setting, it did not preserve the error for review. What caused the settling damage to plaintiffs' home was a jury question, and the jury was entitled to determine which expert witnesses it believed. The court concluded that the discretionary treble damages provision of the DTPA meant that the mandatory treble damage provision of Tex. Ins.

The trial court awarded appellee worker total and permanent compensation benefits arising out of his workers' compensation claim against the insurance company for injuries suffered in the course of his employment. His attorney sought review of the portion of the judgment awarding attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee worker was employed as a day laborer and was injured when a 250-pound metal form fell on him. Appellee sustained severe injuries and underwent abdominal surgery. After numerous complications and additional hospital stays, appellee returned to work despite the fact that he was still weak from his injuries. He then suffered a stroke from which he never fully recovered. At the trial, the primary point of contention was whether the original injury caused appellee's total incapacity. Appellant insurance carrier argued that the stroke was the sole producing cause of disability. The jury agreed with appellee that the original injury was a producing cause of his total and permanent incapacity. In affirming the judgment, the court ruled that once appellee proved that the work-related injury was a producing cause of his incapacity, the insurance company was liable for the entire disability to which both the injury and the stroke contributed. The court also ruled that the trial judge was authorized to award attorney fees and to divide the fee between appellee's two attorneys.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court awarding appellee total and permanent compensation, on the ground that ample evidence supported a finding that appellee's incapacity was permanent in nature. The court also ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it apportioned the award of attorney fees between appellant attorney and the lawyer who succeeded him and actually tried the case.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that potential client did not request any communication from appellant, nor did she designate someone to do so for her. The court held that Tex. Penal Code &sect; 38.01(11) (1992) contained no statutory exceptions for the state to negate in the indictment. Appellant's plea to the indictment after the amended version was read was effective to join the issue. The court found that the evidence showed that appellant was offering the attorney's legal services to potential clients, thus showing indirectly that she too sought an economic benefit. The court concluded that appellant did not object to the relevancy of alleged hearsay testimony. The charge as given adequately protected appellant's right to have the jury determine whether or not potential client or someone acting on her behalf requested the communication. The barratry statute was not subject to an overbreadth claim because appellant failed to show that she was engaged in protected speech activity. The court held that the statute was not impermissibly vague as applied to appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank and appellant bank associates challenged the judgment of the 44th Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas), which was entered in favor of appellee debtor in appellee's malicious prosecution action against appellants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on appellant bank associates' testimony, appellee debtor, who was in bankruptcy, was indicted for hindering a secured creditor. That indictment was later quashed. Appellee sued appellant bank and appellant bank associates for malicious prosecution. The jury awarded appellee actual and punitive damages. Appellants challenged the judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, and reversed in part. The evidence was sufficient to show that appellants acted without probable cause and with malice in instituting criminal proceedings against appellee, and that appellants presented false testimony to the grand jury. Appellee's doctor's testimony was sufficient to support the award of future medical expenses for appellee's post-traumatic stress disorder. The jury was properly instructed that all factual issues were to be determined by the preponderance of the evidence standard. The award of exemplary damages was supported by the evidence and was not the result of the jury's passion or prejudice. The award or prejudgment interest on future damages was authorized by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5069-1.05, &sect; 6, but the award of prejudgment interest on punitive damages was improper.</SPAN></P>

Sufficient evidence supported the jury's findings. Prejudgment interest on future damages was proper, but prejudgment interest could not be recovered for punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of denial of her pre-trial application for writ of habeas corpus, contending that her prosecution for perjury was barred by equitable estoppel, that the statute tolling the statute of limitations was unconstitutional, and that the preindictment delay in the case ran afoul of both the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution and the due course law guarantee of the Texas Constitution. On appeal, the lower court judgment was affirmed. In support of its ruling, the court held that denial of a pre-trial writ of habeas corpus could be appealed under certain circumstances, such as when the defendant was accused of violating a facially unconstitutional statute. With respect to the instant case, however, the perjury statute in question was facially valid. Accordingly, the court found that it did not have jurisdiction to review appellant's unconstitutional challenge to the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, decedent's surviving sister, sought review of an order of the 134th District Court of Dallas County (Texas), which granted summary judgment to appellee nursing home in appellant's survivorship, deceptive trade practices, and breach of fiduciary duty claims against appellee following decedent's death from injuries sustained when falling out of appellee's second story window.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with appellee nursing home that the limitations period had expired when appellant, decedent's sister, brought her survivorship suit following her brother's fall from a window at the facility. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01, provided that no health care liability claim could be filed, regardless of the complainant's legal disability, unless initiated within two years of the tort; thus, appellant's or decedent's unsound mind could not toll the statute. And even though &sect; 10.01 did not abolish fraudulent concealment as a basis for extending limitations, appellant failed to show appellee's intention to conceal the injury, given that she was timely advised of the incident. Thus, no factual issue for summary judgment purposes was raised. And because appellant still had 22 months after discovering the injuries to sue, &sect; 10.01 did not unconstitutionally deprive her of access to the courts. Further, &sect; 12.01(a) barred express warranty causes of action based on the care appellee was to provide. And because appellant's breach of fiduciary duty claim was a recast health care liability claim, the expired limitations period also applied to that claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed granting summary judgment to appellee nursing home in survivorship, express warranty, and breach of fiduciary duty claims by appellant, decedent's surviving sister, following his death from window fall, as appellant's or decedent's unsound mind, appellee's alleged fraudulent concealment, or open courts doctrine did not toll limitations period, and as warranty and breach of fiduciary duty causes of action were also time-barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ordered appellant to turn over a cause of action asserted against appellee to the appellee in partial satisfaction of a judgment that appellee held against appellant. Appellant challenged the trial court's turnover order, arguing that application of Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code &sect; 31.002 was unconstitutional as applied to him under these circumstances. In setting aside the trial court's turnover order and rendering a judgment that appellee take nothing, the appellate court concluded that appellant had a cognizable common law cause of action against appellee and that appellee's reliance upon the turnover statute resulted in its being able to extinguish the cause of action against itself. By requiring appellant, as a judgment debtor, to turn over his cause of action against appellee to the appellee, the judgment creditor, appellee became the holder of a cause of action against itself, and appellant was effectively deprived of his right to seek adjudication of his cause of action without receiving any value in return for it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxing entities challenged the judgment of the 79th Judicial District Court of Brooks County (Texas) that granted summary judgment in favor of appellee taxpayers in their action seeking a refund of taxes for the years 1985 through 1987 on the grounds that appellees paid taxes for the same piece of property for the same years. Appellants also challenged the denial of their motion for summary judgment by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of trial court granting summary judgment in favor of appellee taxpayers. Appellees moved for summary judgment claiming that they were entitled to a refund because they erroneously paid taxes on another's behalf as a result of an honest mistake. Appellant taxing entities did not dispute the fact that appellees erroneously paid taxes for the same piece of property, but based their motion for summary judgment on other grounds, which the court rejected. The court held that a payment made without knowledge of all relevant facts was not voluntary. The court also held that appellees were not required to file a &quot;protest&quot; under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 41.01-41.70, 42.01-42.43 (1992) to exhaust their administrative remedies. Further, the evidence demonstrated that appellees applied for a tax refund, thus complying with Tex. Tax. Code Ann. &sect; 25.25(c) (1992). Moreover, Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 31.31 (1992) authorized a mechanism for obtaining a refund even if the payment made by the taxpayer matched the amount shown as &quot;due&quot; on the bill. Finally, the court held that appellants' estoppel by rendition argument was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment granting summary judgment on behalf of appellee taxpayers and denying appellant taxing entities' cross motion for summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's son, a student in appellee school district, had a ponytail in violation of the school's hair length rule. As punishment, the student was placed in a separate classroom, isolated from the student body, and taught by a substitute teacher. Appellant filed an action against appellee for violation of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3a, and for intentional infliction of emotional distress. She sought an injunction, a declaratory judgment, and damages. Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, finding that summary judgment was improper on the constitutional claim because the requisite balancing test required a factfinder's assessment of the constitutionality of the rule and a consideration of the weight of the evidence. Summary judgment was improper on the statutory causes of actions because, under statute, the reasonableness of the rule was inherently an issue for the finder of fact. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment on appellant's claims for actual and exemplary damages because sovereign immunity barred those claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of the County Court at Law #2, Jefferson County, Texas, which convicted him of the misdemeanor offense of disorderly conduct for noise. Appellant claimed that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.01(a)(5)(1992) was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and sentence of the trial court, which convicted appellant criminal defendant of the misdemeanor offense of disorderly conduct for noise because it found that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.01(a)(5)(1992) was not vague. The court examined appellant's argument that the words &quot;makes unreasonable noise&quot; were overly vague. The court found that the word &quot;unreasonable&quot; was widely used and well understood. Therefore the court determined that the statute clearly and precisely delineated its reach. Furthermore, the court found that pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.04 (1989) the police properly warned appellant that she would be arrested for her loud and disturbing communication if she did not cease the disturbance. Appellant was arrested after she was warned; thus, the court held that she had fair notice of the proscribed conduct. The court held that &sect; 42.01(a)(5) was not unconstitutional because it was not vague and when read in conjunction with &sect; 42.04 it did not encourage arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court that convicted appellant for the misdemeanor offense of disorderly conduct for noise.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city sought review of a writ of mandamus issued by the 225th District Court of Bexar County (Texas), which held that defendant was required to bargain collectively with plaintiff, the San Antonio Park Rangers Association, because park rangers were, as a matter of law, policemen who were entitled to collective bargaining pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5154c-1, &sect; 5(a) (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the San Antonio Park Rangers Association, filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel defendant city to bargain collectively with its park rangers. Pursuant to Tex. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 5154c-1, &sect; 5(a), policemen were granted the right to organize and bargain collectively with their public employers upon adoption by a city. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5154c-1, &sect; 3(2) (1987) defined &quot;policeman&quot; as a sworn, certified full-time paid employee, whether male or female, who regularly served in a professional law enforcement capacity in the police department of any city, town or other political subdivision within the state. The trial court found that park rangers were policemen who were entitled to collective bargaining with defendant under the statute and ordered defendant to bargain collectively with its park rangers. The court reversed the trial court's finding and dissolved the writ of mandamus. The court reviewed the statutory language and the legislative intent of the statute and ruled that the term &quot;policemen&quot; in the statute excluded the San Antonio Park Rangers Department and that the park rangers had no collective bargaining rights.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, appellants' sixth point of error, which complains that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment against these parties is overruled in part.  Summary judgment was improperly granted against all other defendants because collateral estoppel does not apply, and there is a question of fact regarding whether each of the three foods present on Susan Trapnell's plate are suspected of containing sulfites actually caused or contributed in causing her death. Points of error one through five are sustained.  Judgment is accordingly REVERSED in all respects against all defendants except Univar, Van Waters, and McKesson; judgment is AFFIRMED for these three defendants with respect to their defenses against the adult plaintiffs.  <BR></SPAN></P>

On review, the court reversed the summary judgments, except those based on limitations. The court found that: collateral estoppel did not apply, because the issue of whether sulfites were present was not, inter alia, fully and fairly litigated and because preclusion would have violated appellants' right to a jury trial; a question of fact existed regarding the comparative causation of each food product; the government contractor defense was not proven, because summary judgment evidence did not include evidence supporting any of the elements of that defense; and the statute of limitations was a bar to appellants, husband and mother's causes of actions for wrongful death and loss of consortium but not for appellant child's.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from the order of the County Court at Law No. 1 of Hidalgo County (Texas) that granted defendant attorney's motion to dismiss two charges of barratry, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.12(a) (1989), upon an indictment and information that alleged defendant had procured another to solicit for him certain employment to prosecute suits and collect claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attorney was charged by indictment and information with two counts of barratry, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.12(a) (1989), for allegedly procuring another person to solicit for him certain employment to prosecute personal injury suits and collect claims. Defendant moved to dismiss on several grounds. Without specifying the grounds therefor, the trial court granted the motion and dismissed the charges. The state appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that the charging instruments were defective in that they failed to allege with sufficient definiteness the manner and means that defendant procured another to solicit employment. At the same time, the court also ruled that &sect; 38.12 was not overbroad and the term &quot;procure&quot; was not vague. The statute did not infringe upon free speech rights and did not contain an unconstitutional mandatory presumption with respect to intent because Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 2.05 made all presumptions permissive. The charging instruments sufficiently alleged the requisite intent to obtain economic benefit and they were not required to identify by name the persons solicited, since procurement was the forbidden act, not solicitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal order was affirmed because the charging instruments failed to allege with sufficient definiteness the manner and means of procurement; however, the statute did not violate defendant's free speech rights or contain an invalid mandatory presumption, the term &quot;procure&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague, the charging instruments adequately alleged intent, and identification of the persons solicited was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent rented a house owned by appellee landlord. The house was leased and managed by appellee manager through appellee management company. Decedent died from smoke inhalation during a fire in the house. Appellant administratrix filed a survival action against appellee landlord and, eventually, all appellees. After appellees filed special exceptions, appellant's sixth amended petition in part asserted claims of negligence, breach of the implied warranty of habitability, and violations under Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 92.255 to 92.256, known as the state smoke detector statute. Appellees subsequently filed motions to dismiss, and appellee manager filed a motion for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations. The trial court entered judgment for appellees,. Consequently, appellant sought review, in part arguing decedent's mental incompetence excused her non-compliance with &sect; 92.259(a). On review, the court affirmed the dismissal because the conditions imposed by &sect; 92.259(a) were conditions precedent to appellees' liability for failure to install a smoke detector, and without evidence of decedent's compliance, there was no basis of liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that granted the motions to dismiss of appellee landlord, appellee manager, and appellee management company, because the request and notice provisions of the smoke detector statute were conditions precedent to liability for failure to install a smoke detector, and decedent's mental status did not excuse her non-compliance with the conditions; thus, appellant administratrix was unable to assert a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

Appellant alleged the state failed to prove venue, but the court found that appellant had waived the point of error because, at the punishment stage, appellant admitted he was guilty. Appellant contended that he was denied counsel of choice at his second trial. However, appellant was not entitled to be represented by counsel who had been disbarred. The lower court did not abuse its discretion by granting a mistrial due to manifest necessity then it learned that appellant's counsel had been disbarred. Thus, jeopardy had not attached at appellant's first trial and his retrial was not barred by double jeopardy. Appellant's allegation that the state violated Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

Appellant challenged the judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court was not required to submit appellant's special plea of double jeopardy to the jury as no evidence supported the plea. Double jeopardy did not bar appellant's prosecution for the offense of UUMV because fleeing and UUMV were not the same offense under the Blockburger test. The State's indictment did not rely on appellant's conduct of fleeing to establish an essential element of UUMV.

He made the confession after his rights had been read to him and after choosing not to exercise his right to have an attorney or to terminate the police questioning. A jury found him guilty of murder. Defendant raised several errors, including that the trial court erred in submitting an instruction to the jury on parole, arguing that it exceeded the authority given to the legislature under the state constitution. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that an instruction, which tracked the language of the parole statute did not exceed the scope of the authority granted by a constitutional amendment. The amendment provided that the legislature should have authority to enact parole laws and laws that required or permitted courts to inform juries about the effect of good conduct time and eligibility for parole and mandatory supervision on the period of incarceration served by a defendant convicted of a criminal offense.

The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees, and appellants sought review. The court held that Chapter 2 of the Alcoholic Beverage Code provided the exclusive cause of action for providing an alcoholic beverage to a person 18 years of age or older and that liability could only be imposed upon appellees if it was shown that at the time of the sale it was apparent to appellees that the individual being sold the alcoholic beverage was obviously intoxicated to the extent that he presented a clear danger to himself and others, and the intoxication of the recipient of the alcoholic beverage was the proximate cause of the damages suffered.

The court held that appellant timely perfected its appeal by filing it within 10 days after the commission's final decision and requesting that the decision be set aside. The trial court erred in setting aside the commission's order merely because the testimony was conflicting or disputed. The trial court was only required to review the reasonableness of the administrative order, not its correctness. The trial court also erred in ruling that the commission's order was void because it stated that the officer was indefinitely suspended as opposed to permanently dismissed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to the charges of possession of marihuana, possession of a taxable substance on which the tax had not been paid, and delivery of marihuana. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal complaining that the statute involved was unconstitutional. In his first point of error, appellant contended the trial court erred because, by making the tax demand, the state acknowledged marihuana as an item in the stream of commerce. The court found no merit in appellant's argument that if the state chose to tax a substance, it had to declare it legal no matter who possessed it. Appellant further asserted the trial court erred in refusing to quash the indictments because marihuana, a wild-growing plant, could be cultivated in organized agriculture, a pursuit with special protection under Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 19, but appellant cited no authority for the proposition. Appellant alleged in his third point of error that the legislature violated the constitution when it enacted a personal property tax on the contraband, which the court rejected because appellant failed to show how the tax rate for marihuana based on weight was unfair.</SPAN></P>

It further found that the trial court abused its discretion when it granted habeas corpus relief to the real party in interest because in an extradition request, the trial court was limited to determination of whether the extradition documents on their face were in order; whether petitioner had been charged with a crime in the demanding state; whether petitioner was the person named in the request for extradition; and whether petitioner was a fugitive.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the decision without first paying the tax allegedly owed. The trial court dismissed the action for want of jurisdiction. The court affirmed the decision and held that the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-13a, &sect; 19 (1992), did not confer a direct right of appeal to taxpayers because the law did not repeal the jurisdictional requirements of the tax code, which required payment of the tax. The court held that Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 112.051 did not violate appellant's due process rights or equal protection rights under the federal constitution. The court held that the right to challenge taxing authorities derives from statute and was not a common law cause of action, and thus, failure to pay the tax before appealing did not offend the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court held that the restrictions placed on equitable relief or declaratory judgments did not offend due process or equal protection provisions because no cause of action existed at common law to challenge the collection of tax revenues.</SPAN></P>

Appellants alleged negligence, inverse condemnation, and violations of the Texas Water Code resulting in damage to and loss of their real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted summary judgment against appellant property owners and in favor of appellee city in an action arising from alleged water erosion of appellants' property. On appeal, appellants contended that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment against them on their claim of negligence. The court found that appellants' property damage claim was governed by the two-year statute of limitations pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.003(a) (1986). Appellants first experienced and discovered water erosion in 1986, but did not file suit until December 13, 1990, well outside of the limitations period. Appellants' appearance before the city council did not constitute actual notice under the Texas Tort Claims Act. Because appellants failed to meet the notice-of-claim requirements under both the city charter and the Texas Tort Claims Act, their claims were barred as a matter of law. The maintenance of the storm sewer of which appellants complained was a governmental function. Consequently, appellee was not liable for alleged negligence because the claim did not arise under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 101.021 (1986). The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment below against appellant property owners and in favor of appellee city, on the grounds that appellants' negligence claim was barred by the statute of limitations. Appellants failed to meet the notice-of-claim requirements under both the city charter and the Texas Tort Claims Act, thus their claims were barred as a matter of law. Appellee also had governmental immunity against appellants' claim.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that the statute was void for vagueness and for overbreadth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested after he arranged for and purchased $ 6,000 worth of cocaine from undercover officers. Appellant was convicted under Tex.

Appellant contended that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and conviction and held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The court held that persons of ordinary intelligence could readily understand the terms &quot;funds,&quot; &quot;invests,&quot; and &quot;finance,&quot; so that one could determine with reasonable precision what specific conduct was prohibited. The court held that the statute also gave sufficient notice to law enforcement personnel so as to prevent arbitrary enforcement. The court held that the statute was not facially overbroad as there was nothing to show that it penalized speech or conduct which was protected by U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant pled guilty to two charges of possession of less than 28 grams of cocaine and pled true to two enhancement paragraphs in each indictment, he contended that his pleas were not voluntary. The court reviewed the record and found that the trial judge questioned appellant extensively about the voluntariness of his pleas and established on the record that appellant understood that his guilty pleas would not entitle him to a special deal. After reviewing all of the facts and circumstances, the court found that appellant's pleas were voluntary, and overruled his points of error. The court also overruled appellant's allegation that the trial court erred in failing to admonish him as to the consequences of a guilty plea for a noncitizen, as the record contained no evidence that appellant was not a U.S. citizen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant sought review of the 23rd District Court, Brazoria County (Texas), which convicted him of aggravated robbery with two enhancement paragraphs. Appellant argued that an out-of-court identification was overly suggestive, that the state used peremptory challenges to eliminate minority jurors, and that appellant should have been granted a directed verdict on the enhancement paragraphs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant sought review of his conviction in the lower court for aggravated robbery with enhancements. The evidence showed appellant had pointed a gun at a man, taken his checkbook, and then fled. Appellant was apprehended, and the man was taken to identify him at a single showup. The court examined whether the single showup was unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable misidentification. The court found that the witness' opportunity to view appellant at the time of the offense, the degree of attention, accuracy of prior description, level of certainty, and length of time between the offense and confrontation were sufficient that the identification did not result in irreparable misidentification. The court held that although the state's use of peremptory challenges did present a prima facie case of discrimination, the lower court's denial of appellant's Batson motion was not clearly erroneous because the state offered explanations for its challenges. The court found that the lower court properly limited the jury's consideration of enhancement paragraphs to those containing the date of the offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant water supply corporation sought review of the lower court's dismissal of its cause of action against appellees, Texas Department of Health and a solid-waste disposal operator, claiming appellee department amended a permit without a public hearing. The lower court severed appellant's claim for judicial review of the permit pursuant to the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (APTRA), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The court found appellee department had made no decision regarding the alleged amendments to the permit, and had jurisdiction to enforce the terms of its permits, to review disputed design revisions, and to determine when a proposed modification would require amendment. Because there had been no final administrative finding, the court held that appellant was not entitled to judicial review, and affirmed the lower court's dismissal.</SPAN></P>

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) closed the bank and became holder of appellee's note. The FDIC sold the note to appellant.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee on the grounds that appellant's action was barred by the four-year limitations period found in Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.

On appeal, the court reversed the decision and remanded for further proceedings. When appellant purchased the note from the FDIC, he became vested with the same rights as the FDIC on the note.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Corporate appellant sought review of a sales tax deficiency assessed by appellee comptroller without first paying the taxes allegedly owed. Appellant argued that Tex.

Appellant contended that payment presented an impossible condition that foreclosed the opportunity for a meaningful appeal. The court determined that the jurisdictional requirements of the legislation did not offend appellant's other constitutional rights to open court. The court further determined that no classification of taxpayers was imposed that denied equal protection. The court held that the government had found it necessary to adopt stringent measures for the collection of taxes and that the statutory scheme was rationally related to government's legitimate interest in securing its finances. The court affirmed the order of the lower court dismissing appellant's action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state brought an action to obtain forfeiture of a 1985 Cadillac limousine owned by defendant. Police officers inventoried the limousine because they were going to have the vehicle towed after determining that the vehicle had been used by several people who appeared to be intoxicated on a substance other than alcohol. Officers found a prescription bottle containing tablets, a baggie containing a white powdery substance, a piece of foil containing a brown powdery substance, a metal measuring spoon containing a white powdery substance, and other assorted drug paraphernalia. Field tests showed the brown substance was heroin and the white substance was cocaine. A judgment of forfeiture was ordered. Defendant appealed on grounds of insufficiency of evidence. The court found the evidence adduced at trial showed it was more probable than not that the limousine was instrumental in the possession and abuse of cocaine by a number of individuals, including defendant. The court affirmed the judgment of forfeiture and held that the trial court did not err admitting into evidence the affidavits of co-arrestees, which contained statements against penal interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder after being tried jointly with his codefendant. On remand, the court addressed the admissibility of a tape-recorded statement and the harm appellant may have suffered by the parole charge. The court held that the tape recorded statement could not be redacted to exclude references to codefendant because the statement was 26 minutes long and contained 24 references to codefendant, expressly implicated codefendant, and was highly inculpatory of both defendants; therefore, the tape was properly excluded because admission would have violated codefendant's confrontation rights. The court also held that it was harmless error to give the parole charge. Although the statute on which the instruction was based was declared unconstitutional after appellant's trial, a new version was enacted and therefore appellant would receive the same jury instruction at any new punishment hearing. The court also determined that the jury assessed punishment based on the aggravating circumstances of the crime because it was particularly heinous and concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the parole law instruction did not contribute to the punishment assessed.</SPAN></P>

When the individual failed to appear, the bond was declared forfeited, and an interlocutory judgment of forfeiture was signed. The trial court overruled appellant's request for a remittitur holding that Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

Final judgment was entered against appellant finding that he was jointly and severally liable to pay the bond plus court costs. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment for two reasons. First, appellant was not entitled to a remittitur under art. 22.16(a) because it was unconstitutional, and under the constitutional portion of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 22.16(d) (1989), the trial court acted within its discretion when it denied to remit the forfeited bond prior to entry of a final judgment of forfeiture.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus challenging a judgment from the 177th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of aggravated sexual assault of a child. Appellant contended that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 21.02(6) and 20.03 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment convicting appellant of aggravated sexual assault of a child and denied habeas corpus relief on appellant's claims that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 21.02(6) and 20.03 were unconstitutional. Appellant argued that article 21.02(6), allowing the use of the term &quot;on or about&quot; in an indictment, was void on vagueness grounds and that article 20.03, authorizing the state to present offenses to the grand jury at any time except during their discussions of indictments, denied him an examining trial. The court noted that a law was vague only if it failed to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct was forbidden. The use of the term &quot;on or about&quot; sufficiently alerted appellant to prepare his defense for any time within the applicable five-year statutory period. Although Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 16.01 provided the right to an examining trial before indictment, it did not preclude the presentation of a case to a grand jury without an examining trial. The purpose of an examining trial, to determine probable cause, was as timely accomplished by presenting evidence to the grand jury as by an examining trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied habeas corpus relief and affirmed appellant's aggravated sexual assault conviction. The court concluded that the laws at issue were constitutional. One law was not vague because it sufficiently apprised appellant of the need to prepare his defense for any time during the statutory period. The other law did not deprive appellant of an examining trial right because such a right was not implicated in a grand jury indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the 232nd Judicial District Court, Harris County, Texas, which convicted defendant of illegal investment and assessed punishment at 25 years confinement and $ 300,000.00 fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of illegal investment and on appeal argued that he was denied his right of confrontation, that the trial court committed reversible error by admitting evidence of extraneous offenses, that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence seized in violation of his constitutional rights, that the trial court failed to instruct the jury of the permissible conditions of probation, that he was denied his right to due process of law and a fair trial. The court affirmed and held that confrontation was never considered as an absolute and that hearsay testimony by a co-conspirator may be admitted if other evidence presented sufficiently substantiated its content. The court held that the trial court did not err by failing to include all statutory terms of probation over objection. The court held that absent a showing of good cause, the trial court correctly refused to consider defendant's motion for new trial because it was filed untimely. The court held that extraneous, unadjudicated offenses were admissible during the punishment phase of defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of illegal investment because a recorded statement by co-conspirators was admissible when the proponent of the statements showed by preponderance of the evidence that a conspiracy existed. The court held that where officer made legitimate stop for actual violation of law, officer was free to enforce law and detain defendant for violation, and after impoundment of vehicle, inventory search was legal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient was injured in an automobile accident, and he was treated by appellee doctor for various injuries. Within weeks after appellant was discharged from the hospital, he went to see another physician concerning problems with his right arm.

More than two years later, appellant was told that he had suffered loss of mobility in his right elbow due to the failure of appellee doctor to diagnose properly his broken elbow. Appellant sued appellee doctor for medical malpractice. The court held that appellant knew within weeks of his discharge that appellee had breached the required standard of care resulting in injuries, which was well within the two-year statute of limitations under the medical liability and insurance improvement act. The court held that appellant had a reasonable opportunity to discover the wrong and bring suit, therefore the granting of summary judgment by the trial court was proper since there was no genuine issue of material fact concerning the time when appellant discovered the nature of the injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sheriff challenged a conviction from the 258th District Court, Polk County, Texas, for nepotism under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5996a, based upon the assertion that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and violative of the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sheriff's two children were employed with the sheriff's department before appellant was elected to be sheriff. Appellant promoted one child and gave both raises. Appellant was convicted of nepotism under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5996a. The appellate court reversed. The court observed that &sect; 1(a) of art. 5996a generally prohibited appellant from employing family members. But &sect; 1(b) of art. 5996a excepted family members that were previously employed, than &sect; 1(c) of art. 5996a prohibited appellant from participating in any decision regarding the employment status of a family member. The appellate court held that as applied to a sole officeholder, like appellant, the statute was unconstitutionally vague, because it criminalized any act taken by appellant with respect to employed family members including decisions to dismiss family members for criminal conduct. The appellate court indicated that while the legislature may not have intended that result, a literal reading of the statute required that result.</SPAN></P>

The trial court charged the jury with a parole instruction pursuant to Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (Supp. 1992). The instruction was about the possibility of parole. Defendant appealed. On appeal, defendant argued that the instruction violated his constitutional rights including his right to due process guaranteed by U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV.

The court held that the Texas Constitution had been amended to permit the legislature to pass laws that required or permitted the courts to tell juries about the effect of good conduct time and eligibility for parole. Tex. Const. art. 4, &sect; 11 (a). The court held further that a jury's consideration of parole and commutation laws did not violate federal due process. The court rejected defendant's argument that he had to be given an opportunity to present evidence on the parole laws in light of the instruction.

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann., arts. 6166g and 6184n, &sect; 5 (1979), for expenses incurred by an inmate released on emergency medical reprieve.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee brought suit against appellants, Texas Department of Corrections (TDC) and the State of Texas, to recover expenses incurred by an inmate released on emergency medical reprieve. Appellee's sole contention was that appellants were liable under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 6166g and 6184n, &sect; 5 (1979). Both sides sought summary judgment, and the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee. Appellants sought review and argued that while on reprieve the inmate was not considered a prisoner and as such, appellants were not liable for the expenses. The court held that under art. 6184n, &sect; 5, the inmate was a prisoner of appellant TDC while released on emergency reprieve and appellant TDC was responsible under art. 6166g for treatment. Further, appellants knew the inmate needed medical care and were not harmed by appellee's lack of notice. The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of appellee because appellants had a statutory duty to provide medical care to an inmate on emergency medical reprieve and that duty was not excused by appellee's lack of notice of the inmate's admission or the inmate's financial responsibility provision in the governor's proclamation.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed an identical lawsuit on April 11, 1985, and the trial court granted summary judgment based on limitations. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion for continuance, because appellant failed to rebut the presumption that appellee effected service of its summary judgment motion in compliance with Tex.

The court also held that appellant was not entitled to hybrid representation and that the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction where officers repeatedly asked appellant to leave the premises and he refused. On appellant's remaining points of error, the court overruled because appellant failed to preserve error, failed to support his claims, made mere assertions, or failed to comply with rules of procedure in directing the court to the error about which the complaints were made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the 248th District Court of Harris County (Texas), which convicted defendant of aggravated sexual assault, found defendant guilty, and assessed punishment at confinement for life.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of aggravated sexual assault and assessed punishment at life imprisonment. Defendant appealed contending that there was insufficient evidence, prosecutorial misconduct in the nature of a statement made to the jury outside the record, and an improper jury charge on parole. The court found that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, indicated that a rational trier of fact could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecutor's comment on defendant's written statement which was never admitted into evidence was permissible closing argument and the jury could properly consider the existence of good conduct and parole time but could not consider how it could be awarded or forfeited. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of conviction was affirmed because the trial court properly concluded that a rational trier of fact could find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The state's comments regarding defendant's statement, which had not been admitted into evidence, were permissible closing argument and the charge was proper because the jury was not permitted to calculate the effect any good time conduct and parole had on defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in striking a prospective juror for cause because the veniremember was unable to remain unequivocal when stating that sympathy would not play a part in her decision. The court held that appellant was not entitled to have the jury indicate whether guilt was due to loss of physical or loss of mental facilities. The court determined that the imposition of dual jail and restitution center terms was not unconstitutionally excessive since the combined total amount of time did not exceed the maximum sentence allowed by law. The court held that the imposition of 180 days detention as a condition of probation pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Pro. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 12 (1992) was proper. The court also held that it was not unreasonable for the trial court to order appellant to pay the cost of alcohol and drug testing every day while he was on intensive probation and that the trial court was not required to make an express finding of appellant's ability to pay for the testing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged defendant with the offense of hindering a secured creditor, a jury was empanelled and sworn, defendant pleaded not guilty, and during testimony of the first witness, defendant objected to two exhibits, a security agreement and loan agreement. State challenged the trial court judgment, contending that it erred in sustaining defendant's objection. The court dismissed the state's appeal, finding that jeopardy attached when the jury was empanelled and sworn, preventing the state's appeal. Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 44.01(a)(1), which permitted state to appeal any trial court order concerning an indictment or information that effectively terminated the prosecution in favor of the defendant, did not apply to this appeal because jeopardy had attached. The court also noted that the indictment was dismissed on the state's motion, and the state should not be able to take advantage of a resulting error on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees, Texas Commission on Jail Standards (Commission) and executive director in appellant parent's lawsuits for injunctive and declaratory relief and for damages under the Texas Wrongful Death Act, the Survival Statute, and the Texas Tort Claims Act arising out of their son's suicide in Tom Green County Jail. Appellant alleged negligent and reckless acts and violation of the Texas Constitution for failing to adequately supervise, to maintain standards and to take preventive measures to diminish a life-endangering situation. The court affirmed the summary judgment for appellees because the jail system structure and the applicable statutes vested responsibility and supervisory duty for county jails with the county commissioners' courts, not the Commission. The court held the Commission did not owe a duty to appellant and successfully negated an element of appellant's claim. The court concluded that the legislature enacted Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 511.009 (1990) and other statutes with full knowledge of the existing law and responsibilities and purposefully withheld mandatory enforcement duties from the Commission.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees and denied appellants' motions for partial summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the present action was barred by res judicata and could not be asserted in an equitable bill of review because it arose out of the same facts and involved the same parties as the federal court actions, the judgments in the federal court actions were final and on the merits, and the claims asserted in the present action were or could have been asserted in the federal court actions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of criminal nonsupport of his minor child under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 25.05 (1989). He argued that because the court refused to grant his motion to dismiss the information, he was denied due process and equal protection and was ordered imprisoned for debt. He also urged that, because the information failed to define the word &quot;support,&quot; the court erred in denying his motion to quash. The court affirmed his conviction. It held that the information was sufficient to charge the commission of the offense in ordinary and concise language and in such a manner as to give a person of common understanding notice of the particular offense with which he was charged and to enable the court, on conviction, to pronounce the proper judgment. The court further held that imprisonment assessed as punishment for violation of a statute was not an unconstitutional imprisonment for debt, that the trial court's jury instruction that did not require appellee state to prove ability to pay was a correct statement of the law as amended, and that the jury verdict was not contrary to the law or the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a teacher of retarded children, was convicted of failure to report child abuse after two aides held a child's hand under hot water as punishment. She sought review, contending that Tex. Fam.

The court affirmed, holding that the statutes were not unconstitutionally vague because they gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of the requirement to file a report with the appropriate agencies when he had cause to believe that a child was being abused. The court further held that the photographs were properly admitted because they were relevant to the attending physician's testimony and were not unduly prejudicial. The court also held that the jury charge did not fail to set out all essential elements of the offense merely because it did not specify every agency to which a person could report suspected child abuse, and that the information was not defective because it tracked the language of the applicable statutes.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, lower court judgment was affirmed. In support of its ruling, the court held that once a governor had granted extradition, a court considering release on habeas corpus could do no more than decide whether the extradition documents were in order on their face, whether the petitioner had been charged with a crime in the demanding state, whether the petitioner was the person named in the extradition request, and whether the petitioner was a fugitive. With respect to the instant case, the court noted that the state met its burden of proving that a judicial determination of probable cause had been made.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the sentencing decision from the District Court of Travis County, 331st Judicial District No. 87403 (Texas), which on remand for resentencing of appellant's sexual assault conviction admitted evidence of appellant's &quot;prior conviction&quot; for burglary. The burglary conviction arose from actions after the sexual assault, and the evidence was entered after the first sexual assault sentence but before resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was sentenced on remand to 80 years for aggravated sexual assault. As his main challenge to the resentencing decision, appellant argued that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence of appellant's conviction for burglary, which arose out of actions after the sexual assault and which was entered after the original sentencing for sexual assault. The court rejected appellant's argument, finding that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 44.29(b) &amp; 37.07, &sect; 3(a) (1992) worked together to render admissible evidence of a final conviction occurring before the date of the punishment retrial. The court also denied appellant's request for reversal based on prosecutorial comments. First, the trial court had sustained appellant's objection to some of those comments, and appellant had not requested any additional relief below. Second, appellant had not even objected to other comments, which were therefore waived on appeal. The court also rejected appellant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims addressed to the merits of the original guilt determination, as they had already been denied in the first appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the sentence, imposed upon appellant pursuant to resentencing, of 80 years for aggravated sexual assault. The trial court did not err when it admitted, during the punishment retrial, evidence of a burglary conviction arising from acts committed after the assault and entered after the original assault sentence. Appellant's remaining arguments had been either waived or addressed in the first appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed an order of the 9th District Court of Montgomery County (Texas), which granted appellee's motion to suppress evidence in a case for the first degree felony offense of engaging in organized criminal activity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed an interlocutory appeal after appellee's motion to suppress evidence was granted in the state's case charging appellee for the first degree felony offense of engaging in organized criminal activity. At issue was the search of a wrecker service which contained an office, residence, garage, and apartment. On appeal, the court affirmed and was unwilling to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion based upon controverted evidence because the regulatory inspection authorized by the licensing scheme extended only to documentation. The search conducted by the officers in this case was not in furtherance of the regulatory scheme and exceeded the scope of a legitimate search. Appellee's cross-point regarding the court's failure to grant appellee's request to suppress evidence from two subsequent searches of the property was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because in an appeal by the state under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.01 (1992), appellee had no right to an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of appellee's motion to suppress evidence because the search of wrecker service property was not in furtherance of a regulatory scheme and exceeded the scope of a legitimate search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant challenged an adjudication and disposition of a juvenile court action alleging appellant committed murder. Appellant was adjudicated under the state's determinate sentencing statutes. The jury found appellant used a deadly weapon and assessed disposition at 30 years. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the determinate sentencing statutes and asserted that the several actions by the trial court constituted reversible error. Appellant specifically complained that the determinate sentencing scheme provided that a person could serve time in the penitentiary or be punished without ever being convicted of a crime, it denied appellant bail, and that it violated the separation of powers doctrine. The court noted that appellant did not argue impropriety, only the potential for impropriety. No error was shown to have occurred, and thus, nothing was presented to the court for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling of the trial court finding appellant used a deadly weapon and assessing disposition at 30 years when appellant did not preserve certain issues for review on appeal and the determinate sentencing statutes furthered a compelling state interest.</SPAN></P>

The motion was based on appellant's failure to provide a complete statement of facts, and the points were that the trial court erred in denying his motion to change venue, in allowing his cross-examination on certain matters, and in its factual and legal conclusions concerning the venue hearing. The court affirmed, holding that appellant failed to timely prosecute his appeal, because he absented himself for more than three years from the jurisdiction, and the court reported had already destroyed any notes concerning appellant's case. Appellant had not showed compliance with the requirements to obtain a reversal of his conviction due to the incomplete statement of facts. He used all his peremptory challenges, did not request additional challenges, and did not challenge any of the selected jurors for cause.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and co-defendant were charged with aggravated robbery by indictment, which alleged a prior conviction for enhancement purposes and both pled true to the enhancement paragraphs. Evidence of co-defendant's prior conviction and the date of the offense were presented, showing the present offense was committed before co-defendant's sentence for the prior conviction expired. Both were tried and convicted in the same trial. Defendant alleged state's argument during the punishment stage was improper since it invited the jury to consider parole laws in assessing punishment and the trial court's denial of a jury charge on parole was reversible error. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that since prior enhancement convictions must occur sequentially, state was allowed to argue the date of indictment and prior sentences but it did not directly mention or allude to the parole laws and merely summed up the evidence, and that Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 37.07(4)(a) required a parole charge and the failure to give the charge was harmless error since it was not calculated to injure defendant's rights and defendant suffered no actual harm from the omission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their divorce decree, appellant ex-wife received the couple's home in return for the execution of a promissory note and deed of trust to appellee ex-husband. Appellant made very few payments under the original agreement and two subsequent modifications, and appellee sought to foreclose on the home. The court found that the parties' agreement incorporated into the divorce decree constituted part of a valid and binding final judgment. The court held that appellant's claim that the lien was unconstitutional was an impermissible collateral attack on a final judgment because it claimed the judgment debt was rendered voidable by an erroneous interpretation of substantive law. The court found appellant's assertion that the interest charged in the modified agreements was usurious to be meritless. The court noted that interest charged on past due interest was not usurious and appellant's forbearance from seeking additional child support was not a &quot;charge&quot; within the meaning of the usury statutes. The court affirmed the award of summary judgment to appellee and the denial of appellant's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was convicted of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault. He appealed his conviction. The court found that a conviction for aggravated kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault required proof that appellant used or exhibited a firearm. There was sufficient evidence that appellant used or exhibited a firearm because complainant testified that appellant pointed a gun at her and threatened to kill her, and a gun was found in appellant's possession. The court found the jury instruction as to good conduct time and parole was proper because Tex. Const. art.

The court held that the jury instruction provided the jury with relevant information and eliminated the risk that the jury would be misled by the usual meaning of phrases such as &quot;20 years&quot; and possibly assess punishment at a meaninglessly low level. The court held that the constitution did not prohibit the state from accurately characterizing its sentencing choices. Appellant objected to the instruction regarding a deadly weapon. The court noted that appellant was indicted for causing the death of the complainant by shooting him with a deadly weapon, namely, a firearm and, therefore, when the jury found appellant guilty as charged in the indictment, they necessarily found that he used a deadly weapon in the commission of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant surety provided statutory public official bonds for the trustees of a hospital district that was declared unconstitutional in an action filed by appellee taxpayers. Appellees were awarded attorney fees and sought to collect them from the bonds. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court ordered appellants to pay the attorney fees. Appellants claimed no liability because the bond did not explicitly provide for attorney fees and the trustees did not perform any acts unfaithfully. The court affirmed, finding that the bond was broadly worded to include any damages awarded against the trustees in the unfaithful performance of their official duties. In addition, the court found that the trustees had held meetings in violation of the Open Meetings Act, which supported the trial court's finding that the trustees had unfaithfully performed their duties and thus triggered the bond. On appellees' cross-motion for attorney fees under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 38.001(8) (1986), the court found that appellees were incidental beneficiaries at best to the surety contract, so they were not entitled to additional attorney fees based upon the contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for burglary of habitation with the underlying felony of aggravated assault. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that both the indictment and the jury instructions were proper, despite appellant's contention that they failed to require a culpable mental state on the element of entering complainant's habitation knowing that it was without effective consent. The court found that there was no implied consent to break and enter an apartment merely because appellant and complainant had dated. Additionally, no egregious harm resulted from the omission of the word &quot;intentionally&quot; from the jury charge because there was no evidence that appellant did not intend to enter the apartment. The trial court did not err in limiting cross-examination of the complainant because evidence regarding the intimacy of her relationship with appellant was not relevant to appellant's right to break into her apartment. The limitation of appellant's cross-examination of a witness was proper because that testimony was not relevant as to whether appellant had consent to enter the apartment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's burglary conviction because there was no error in the indictment or jury charge as to his culpable mental state, and the trial court's limitation of the cross-examination of two witnesses was not in error where neither witnesses' testimony was relevant to the issue of the complainant's consent to appellant's entry into her apartment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a conviction for speeding by the County Court at Law #2 of Denton County (Texas). Based upon religious beliefs, appellant contended that the fine assessed in Federal Reserve Notes consisted of unlawful money and, as such, the Texas state laws imposing fines payable with Federal Reserve notes for traffic violations violated the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury found appellant guilty of speeding and assessed a $ 200.00 fine. Appellant's religious convictions led him to believe that Federal Reserve Notes were not lawful money. Thus, on appeal, appellant asserted that the trial court erred when it imposed a fine, based upon state law, that consisted of appellant paying a fine using Federal Reserve Notes because it was unconstitutional. Appellant also asserted that the trial judge and the prosecutor violated their oaths of office in enforcing unconstitutional statutes. The court affirmed. The court ruled that Congress had the power under the United States Constitution to establish a national paper currency; had delegated this power to the Federal Reserve System; and had designated the Federal Reserve Note as legal tender. Thus, the court held that Federal Reserve Notes were lawful money, and Texas statutes and the Texas State officers that imposed fines payable with Federal Reserve Notes for traffic violations were constitutional. The court stated that although appellant was entitled to his personal opinions, he was not entitled to set himself up as separate and apart from the laws of the land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court that assessed fines in Federal Reserve Notes against appellant for speeding. Appellant was denied relief because there was no violation of appellant's constitutional rights when he was assessed a fine payable in Federal Reserve Notes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer sought review of a judgment on verdict by the 2nd Judicial District Court of Cherokee County (Texas) that awarded appellee worker's compensation benefits on the basis that appellee was injured in the course of his employment on May 8, 1989, and that such injury produced total incapacity from said date until July 24, 1989, and partial incapacity from July 25, 1989 until July 25, 1993.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court awarded appellee workers' compensation benefits for an injury that occurred in the course of his employment. The jury found for appellant insurer on its affirmative defense that appellee unjustifiably refused employment that was reasonably suited to his incapacity and physical condition and had been secured for him in the locality where he was injured. Appellant sought review, claiming that the trial court improperly entered a judgment on the jury's verdict by including an award of partial incapacity benefits during the period of unjustified refusal found by the jury. The court held that that there was ample evidence of probative value to support each element of the affirmative defense pleaded by appellant, and that it was reversible error under Tex. R. Civ. P. 301 for the trial court to disregard the jury's findings in regard to appellant's affirmative defense absent a motion to disregard a jury finding and/or render a judgment non obstante veredicto.The trial court judgment was reversed and set aside to the extent it awarded appellee workers' compensation benefits for the period in which the jury determined that he unjustifiably refused to return to work.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of a judgment from the County Court No. 2, Galveston County (Texas), which denied appellant reimbursement under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 14.062 for child support of appellee's child. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in construing Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.42(a) to bar collection of reimbursement for a period prior to the date of filing suit to establish paternity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded a judgment denying appellant state's claim for retroactive child support reimbursement pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 14.062. The trial court construed Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.42(a) (statute) to restrict collection of retroactive support under &sect; 14.062 to the date of filing of a suit to establish paternity. The court disagreed with this construction. Interpreting the statute in such a manner would lead to unconstitutional discrimination against illegitimate children because they would be denied support from their natural fathers that legitimate children received. Therefore, upon a finding of paternity, temporary orders for child support could be awarded retroactive to the date of filing of the petition, and upon final adjudication, the trial court could award child support retroactive to the time of birth. The judgment was reversed, child support reimbursement was awarded to appellant, and the cause was remanded for a determination of the amount of post-judgment interest and an appropriate amount of periodic or lump sum payments on that judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction from the County Criminal Court No. 4, Dallas County (Texas) for driving while intoxicated. Defendant claimed, among other things, that the state failed to establish probable cause to arrest him and, therefore, the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of his intoxication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for driving while intoxicated (DWI). The court affirmed the conviction. The court addressed only defendant's claim that the state failed to establish probable cause to arrest him and, therefore, the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of his intoxication. Defendant was arrested after he was observed accelerating his car from a stop light to the point that the tires were unable to grab onto the pavement, thereby making a screeching noise burning off, in violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d, &sect; 185(a) (1977). The trial court concluded that because defendant was not in any &quot;drag racing&quot; type of competition at the time, section 185 did not apply. The court ruled that section 185 did apply to the case, and that defendant's warrantless arrest fell within one of the enumerated exceptions to the warrant requirement, in that he was observed while in the commission of a misdemeanor offense committed in his presence. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 14.01(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for driving while intoxicated. The arresting officer had probable cause to arrest defendant for violating the statute that barred the exhibition of acceleration; the trial court erred in holding that the statute did not apply. Thus, because both the initial stop of defendant and his subsequent arrest were lawful, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence of his intoxication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee adoptive parents filed an action seeking termination of appellant birth mother's parental rights and an order of adoption. The trial court terminated appellant's rights and appointed appellees as joint managing conservators. Appellant sought review. The court reversed. The court held that appellant's actions in executing an affidavit of relinquishment of her parental rights, in accordance with her earlier decision to give up the child for adoption, did not constitute evidence under the abandonment statute of Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 15.02(1)(A) (1992). Appellant was not disregarding her parental obligations, but was instead attempting to affirmatively provide for the child's welfare through others. To hold that her actions constituted abandonment would cause &sect; 15.02(1)(A) to be unconstitutionally overbroad and a violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 15.03(d) applied to allow appellant to revoke the affidavit of relinquishment after the 60-day irrevocability clause had expired and before her parental rights were terminated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, as superintendent of a school district, executed a document purporting to amend a lease/purchase agreement to a lease agreement for a climate control system. By doing so, he hoped to avoid questions about whether he had complied with statutory competitive bidding dictates required for purchase agreements. Defendant was convicted of two counts of tampering with a governmental record in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 37.10(a),(c). On appeal, the reviewing court rejected his claim that the state failed to prove that he acted with the specific intent to defraud or harm. The court found that a rational trier of fact reasonably could have concluded that defendant intended to defraud or harm the school district to protect himself and the district from being accused of violating the competitive bid statute. The court also rejected defendant's claim that a jury instruction unconstitutionally limited his mistake-of-fact defense to only mistakes formed through a reasonable belief. The court noted that the definition of reasonable belief incorporated a subjective element requiring the jury to consider the facts from defendant's perspective. The court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff defamation litigant appealed an order from the 61st District Court, Harris County (Texas), denying his motion to retax costs and to enjoin a clerk's execution to collect court and appellate costs upon reversal of a judgment for plaintiff. Plaintiff claimed that the statute allowing for transcription costs, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 52.047 (1988), was unconstitutional and that there was insufficient evidence to support the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff individual brought suit against defendant individuals for slander and libel. The appellate court reversed and rendered judgment that plaintiff take nothing. Defendant obtained a writ of execution upon plaintiff for court costs and transcription fees. Plaintiff brought a motion to retax costs and to enjoin the clerk from collecting the fees. The trial court denied the motion. Plaintiff appealed. Plaintiff claimed that the statute allowing for transcription costs, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 52.047 (1988), was unconstitutional because it was an improper delegation of legislative power. Plaintiff also claimed the fees were unsupported by the evidence and law. The court found that the constitutionality of trial court's setting fees for attorneys and guardians ad litem was unquestioned. The appellate court found little distinction between the setting of those fees and that for transcription. Thus, because the trial court set a reasonable fee, the fees were upheld. Because the transcription work was difficult and the fees were in line with fees charged by local court reporters, there was sufficient evidence to uphold the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's denial of plaintiff defamation litigant's motion to retax costs and to enjoin a clerk's execution to collect court and appellate costs. Because the court found the setting of other attorney fees and the like was constitutional, transcription fees were held similarly constitutional. Because the fees were reasonable and in line with fees set by local court reporters, the fees were upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the 171st Judicial District Court of El Paso County (Texas), which convicted him for aggravated sexual assault and assessed punishment at 40 years' imprisonment, claiming that the court failed to properly instruct the jury during the penalty phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of aggravated sexual assault and assessed punishment at 40 years' imprisonment. The trial court failed to instruct the jury not to consider the extent or manner in which the parole law might affect the punishment assessed. During the jury's deliberation of the punishment stage, the jury sent a note to the trial court specifically requesting information on the percentage of time assessed as punishment which would actually have to be served before defendant would be eligible for parole. The trial court overruled defendant's objection that the jury should be instructed not to consider the effects of parole in their deliberations. The court reversed the judgment of punishment and remanded the case for a new punishment trial because the trial court should have given the jury a curative instruction when it became obvious that is was considering the effects of the parole law. The court concluded that the record did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury to disregard any parole law consideration did not contribute to the assessment of a 40-year sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court imposing punishment of 40 years' imprisonment, holding that the jury should have been given a curative instruction even though defendant had arguably waived any error by not requesting inclusion of that instruction at the time the jury charge was initially submitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On November 6, 1990 officers witnessed appellant speed off, run a stop sign and yield sign, and lose control of his vehicle when they tried to flag him down to stop. When appellant got out of the vehicle, officers observed him throw a brown paper bag, which when recovered contained 125 individually wrapped rocks of crack cocaine. Appellant was charged by indictment with possession of more than 28 grams of cocaine. The indictment contained an enhancement paragraph alleging a prior conviction for robbery by assault. Appellant was found guilty and punishment was assessed at 45 years confinement with a $ 5,000 fine. Appellant challenged the trial court's instruction to the jury on parole and good conduct time under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, and argued that the trial court erred by permitting the introduction of a prior misdemeanor conviction that was facially void. The court found art. 37.07 as amended met constitutional requirements of Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11(a), and that appellant did not satisfy his burden of proof that a fatal defect existed when he did not object to the prior conviction but stipulated he committed offenses. The case was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the case finding that a good conduct and parole instruction did not violate appellant's rights because it was authorized by statute and that a prior conviction was not facially void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed an appeal from a judgment of the 201st District Court of Travis County (Texas), which in a suit for judicial review authorized by the Public Utility Regulatory Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1446c, &sect; 69 (Supp. 1992), affirmed in part and reversed in part a final order issued by the Public Utility Commission of Texas in a telecommunication rate proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee applied to appellant commission, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, for an order increasing the rates it was permitted to charge its customers for intrastate telecommunication services. Five years later, after an intervening lawsuit, appellant commission ordered appellee to reduce its rates to diminish its annual revenues. Appellant commission purported to make the new rates retroactive two years by requiring refunds to customers through credits on future invoices. After a suit for judicial review and an appeal, the court rejected appellant commission's order and remanded, by affirming that part of the district court's judgment that reversed the required refund, and by reversing the district court's judgment to the extent it affirmed the order. The court found that appellant commission could not fix the effective date of appellee's rate retroactively. The court also found, among other things, that appellant commission failed to make the required subsidiary findings for each finding that appellee's payments to affiliates were reasonable and necessary, and erroneously calculated appellee's federal income-tax liability in estimating its operating expenses.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, finding that requiring write-in candidates to register with the county 60 days before the general election was constitutional, because the state legislature had many legitimate interests in formulating election policies and the statutes at issue only required the candidates to register 15 days before early voting began. Texas' due process requirements were not violated.

Appellant, after the state had rested, attempted to show through another witness that complainant, who testified against appellant on direct examination, &quot;always carried a pistol.&quot; Appellant contended that complainant testified at trial that he never carried a gun. Complainant's cousin testified that complainant's reputation in the community for truth and veracity was bad. The court held that under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 608(b) the trial court properly sustained the state's objection to the cousin's testimony regarding whether she ever saw complainant carrying a gun. The trial court's instructions on parole and good conduct time were not unconstitutional. Tex. Code. Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant common-law wife and her husband were divorced. The husband later died. Appellant filed an affidavit of heirship. Appellee mother filed an application to determine heirship, alleging that the decedent fathered her two sons. Appellant brought a plea in intervention, contending she was married to the decedent at the time of his death and denying appellee's paternity claims. Appellee brought a partial summary judgment motion to dismiss the plea. The trial court granted the motion, finding appellant lacked standing. Appellant sought review, claiming a one-year statute of limitations period to establish an informal marriage under Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 1.91(b) (1991) violated the state constitution's equal protection and open courts provisions. The appellate court affirmed. Because the state had a legitimate and reasonable interest in requiring claimants to timely prove the existence of alleged informal marriages in order to facilitate divorce and probate proceedings, the statute did not violate equal protection or the open courts provision. Because appellant failed to comply with the statute, she was precluded from claiming as an heir.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's grant of appellee mother's partial summary judgment motion and denial of appellant's common-law wife's plea in intervention in a probate matter to determine heirship. Appellant's failure to timely establish her informal marriage to decedent precluded her from claiming as an heir. Thus, appellee was allowed to claim her sons, fathered by decedent, as heirs to his estate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer received a tip from a reliable informant that defendant was about to leave an apartment to deliver some drugs. Officers in a marked police car followed defendant, pulled her over, and noticed that defendant leaned over to the floorboard of the passenger seat. An officer conducted a search of the car, and found a bag containing drugs on the floorboard. Defendant was convicted of the felony offense of possession of less than 28 grams of methamphetamine. On appeal, defendant argued that the search of her vehicle was unconstitutional because it was conducted without a warrant. However, the court found that the police received a tip from a reliable informant regarding defendant's unlawful possession and sale of drugs, which validated the search of the car incident to the arrest. Defendant's argument that the trial court committed reversible error in denying the disclosure of the informant was without merit because the argument was not properly preserved for review. Furthermore, the burden was on defendant to show that the informant's identity was material to the defense of her case, which she failed to do.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.14 with unlawfully, intentionally, and knowingly damaging, defacing, and mutilating the flag of the United States of America.

The trial court determined that it was bound to follow the mandate of precedent involving a similar statute. Finding Tex.

The state contended that the strong presumption in favor of constitutionality of statutes was not rebutted by appellee's argument and that the flag represented a symbol of national history and unity worthy of protection through the exercise of proper police power of the state. The appellate court affirmed the decision because it was bound to follow the decisions of all higher courts in their interpretation of the laws.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband and appellee wife executed a premarital agreement prior to marriage. After the marriage began to fail, appellant had appellee sign a second partition agreement. The parties petitioned for divorce, and the trial court granted a final decree which awarded the majority of the assets and the custody of the children to appellee. Appellant sought review and contended that the trial court erred when it failed to enforce the premarital agreement, when it failed to enforce the second partition agreement, and when it awarded custody and child support to appellee. The court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. The court reversed the trial court's invalidation of the premarital agreement because the majority of the agreement was not contrary to Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 15 and because the portion that was invalid was severable. The court affirmed as to the second partition agreement, finding that it was unconscionable when it was executed because of the circumstances that surrounded the execution. The court affirmed the child support and custody award because the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife challenged an order from the 165th District Court, Harris County, Texas, that granted appellee husband summary judgment and allowed appellee to foreclose on the homestead because appellant failed to make any payments on a promissory note pursuant to an agreement, which was incorporated in to the final divorce decree, in return for appellee giving up his interest in the homestead.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife and appellee husband entered into an agreement, which was incorporated into the final divorce decree, that required appellant to execute a promissory note and deed of trust in favor of appellee, and appellee in turn to convey his undivided one-half interest in the homestead to appellant. When appellant failed to make any payments on the note, appellee sought to foreclose by forced sale of the homestead. The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of appellee. The agreement constituted a valid and binding final judgment that precluded appellant from raising a claim under Tex. Const. art. 16, &sect; 50. While &sect; 50 protected the homestead from a forced sale for payment of all debts, it allowed a lien placed on the residence to secure a payment by appellant to appellee for the value of appellee's homestead interest. The interest rate on the promissory note was not usurious under Tex. R. Civ. P. 93(11) because interest on past due interest was not usurious. Further, even assuming that appellant's forbearing from seeking child support constituted a charge under the usury statutes, the amount of child support was too speculative to make a usury determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that granted summary judgment in favor of appellee husband because appellant wife could not collaterally attack an agreement incorporated into the final divorce decree, and in any event the agreement neither violated the Texas constitution's protections against a forced sale of the marital home upon a former spouse's lien, nor charged usurious interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for criminal trespass. Appellant asserted that his conviction violated the free-speech and assembly provisions of the United States and Texas constitutions, that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, and that the trial court erred in excluding evidence and failing to submit his requested instructions to the jury. The court concluded there was no first amendment protection for appellant's activities because the complex had not assumed the functional attributes of public property devoted to public use. The court determined there was sufficient evidence to support appellant's conviction because he was prosecuted for remaining on the property after being notified to leave. The court held that appellant was not entitled to the mistake of fact charge requested because appellant believed he was not trespassing because the location was a public place which was a mistake of law rather than a mistake of fact.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this appeal, appellant challenged his conviction alleging improper use of peremptory challenges by the prosecutor and improper jury instructions. Appellant alleged the prosecutor had used his peremptory challenges to discriminate on the basis of race and he requested a copy of the prosecutor's handwritten note made in preparation for his testimony at the first Batson hearing on the issue. The court held that the prosecutor's notes were not a &quot;statement&quot; by a witness, subject to discovery. The court also held that it was appellant's responsibility to be sure the notes and been sealed and included in the record for review. Appellant failed to do so. The prosecutor was allowed to make peremptory strikes based on his legitimate hunch, so long as it was not racially motivated. Appellant failed to meet his burden of proving discrimination. Appellant argued the trial court erred in not sustaining his objection to the court's jury instruction on the law of parole, because the statute authorizing it had been declared unconstitutional. The court found the instruction did not contribute to appellant's punishment and the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the 232nd District Court, Harris County (Texas) that convicted him of delivery of cocaine. Appellant complained that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction and that the trial court erred in instructing the jury pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (Supp. 1992), that they could consider good conduct time and parole in determining his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that the state presented adequate chain of custody evidence to link appellant to the cocaine police bought from him, and rebuffing appellant's constitutional challenge to the charge on good conduct time and parole, the court affirmed the conviction. The court emphasized that objections concerning chain of custody went to the weight rather than the admissibility of evidence. The identification of the cocaine and police testimony about it were sufficient to permit the trier of fact to find this element beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the trial court properly instructed the jury at the penalty phase under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (Supp. 1992) that it could &quot;consider&quot; parole and good conduct time in setting appellant's sentence. There was no material difference between permitting the jury to consider these factors, and the constitutional basis for this instruction, Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11(a), which authorized courts to &quot;inform&quot; juries of these factors. Furthermore, &sect; 11(a) was itself constitutional, and did not violate Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 13, 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for delivery of cocaine. The court found sufficient evidence of chain of custody to sustain the verdict. The court also held that a statutory charge that the jury could consider parole and good conduct time when assessing sentence was authorized by the constitution and that this authorization was in itself constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners challenged the decision of the 319th District Court, Nueces County (Texas), which granted summary judgment to appellee utilities in a suit brought by appellants for trespass related to the construction of a gas pipeline under a highway when the original right-of-way grant was limited to highway purposes. Appellees sought the award of attorney fees from the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners held fee title to the middle of a state highway abutting their property, which was on a right-of-way that was expressly limited to the construction and maintenance of a permanent road. Appellants brought suit for trespass when appellee utilities built a gas pipeline under the highway. Appellants challenged the trial court's denial of its summary judgment motion and the grant of appellees' summary judgment motion. Appellees sought an award of attorney fees. The court noted that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1436b, &sect; 1, allowed any person engaged in transportation of gas for public consumption to build gas pipelines within a highway right-of-way. The court determined that appellees were engaged in the required activities. Accordingly, the grant of summary judgment to appellees was affirmed. With regard to appellees' request for attorney fees, the court found that the request had not been made, nor was proof of the requested fees submitted, with the motion for summary judgment. As a result, the court overruled appellees' request since it was not presented to the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of summary judgment was affirmed because, under applicable statutes, appellee utilities operated for public use and were, therefore, permitted to use the state's highway right-of-way for the attendant purpose of transporting gas through construction of a pipeline under the highway. Appellees' request for attorney fees, however, was denied because it had not been presented to the trial court with the motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review from their conviction of unlawful redemption of food stamps, contending that the underlying statute,&nbsp;Tex.

On appeal, the convictions were affirmed. In support of its ruling, the court held that as the constitutionality of &sect; 33.011(b) was a nonjurisdiction issue, appellants did not fulfill the requirements of Tex. R. App. P. 41(b)(1) by specifying that they would appeal matters that were raised by written motion and ruled upon before trial. Accordingly, the court held that it could not rule on the merits of appellants' pre-trial motions to quash the indictment. The court further held that the lower court did not commit reversible error as the record did not reflect any objection to the omission of admonishments regarding appellant's citizenship, nor any evidence that appellants were misled or harmed by the absence of such admonishments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed because the issues of constitutionality of the statute in question were not preserved for review, and because the failure of the lower court to admonish appellants regarding the effect of their non-citizen status on their guilty pleas was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution appealed an order dismissing complaint which charged appellee with offense of owning or operating a sexually oriented commercial enterprise outside a city. The trial court found the violation was unconstitutionally vague, unreasonable, and overbroad. The court held a facial challenge to a legislative act, ordinance or order was difficult, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances existed under which the act, ordinance or order would be valid. In a facial challenge to the overbreadth and vagueness of a law, a court determined whether enactment reached a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. The court should then examine the facial vagueness challenge and, assuming the enactment implicated no constitutionally protected conduct, should uphold the challenge only if enactment was impermissibly vague. Further, an attack as being overboard was reserved for complaints concerning U.S. Const. amend. I violations. The court held that an ordinance was not invalid merely because it subjected the commercial exploitation of materials protected by the U.S. Const. amend. I to licensing or zoning requirements.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals reversed the conviction for error during the punishment phase of the trial. Prior to the state's petition for discretionary review, Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

The rule provided that when an error occurred during the punishment phase of trial, on remand, the matter was to be treated as though a defendant's guilt was already established. Appellant's punishment phase was retried and he was sentenced to 80 years' imprisonment. The court of appeals affirmed. Contrary to appellant's assertion, the rule was not a violation of the ex post facto prohibition in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 9 and 10. The rule merely affected the mode procedure and not appellant's substantive rights. No ex post facto violation occurred if the law was merely procedural.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found appellant had violated the terms and conditions of his probation by committing a subsequent offense of sexual assault on a minor and adjudicated appellant guilty. Appellant asserted that the trial court erroneously adjudicated his guilt on the basis that the new allegation of sexual assault was not proven by sufficient evidence. Further, appellant asserted that the trial court adjudicated his guilt based upon improper use of extraneous offense evidence. The court held that, under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 42.12, &sect; 5(b), no appeal could be taken from the trial court's decision to adjudicate. If final adjudication was deferred, the decision to finally enter judgment was not reviewable. The remainder of the proceedings were subject to ordinary review. Therefore, the court lacked authority to review appellant's points of error. The appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction because appellant's points of error related to the trial court's decision to adjudicate guilt on a deferred adjudication on appellant's guilty plea to sexual assault on a child, but the trial court's decision to adjudicate was not appealable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant store employee challenged a conviction from the 230th District Court, Texas, for unauthorized redemption of food stamps based upon complaints that the trial court erred by overruling appellant's motion to quash the indictment, that appellant was denied his constitutional right to a trial by jury, and that appellant had ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant store employee on different occasions redeemed food stamps from an undercover police officer for cash only, contrary to Tex. Hum. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 33.011(b) (1990). The court affirmed appellant's conviction for unauthorized redemption of food stamps. Section 33.011(b) was not unconstitutionally vague where its language specifically prohibited redeeming food stamps for cash only and appellant signed an authorization application that verified that appellant read and understood 7 C.F.R. &sect; 278.2 (1989) which also proscribed redeeming food stamps for cash only. Appellant was not denied a right to a jury trial where in open court and in writing with the consent of the court, the prosecution, and after discussing the pros and cons of waiver, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.13 (1977), appellant waived jury trial. Appellant's counsel was not ineffective regarding appellant's waiver of jury trial where counsel testified that he informed appellant of the right to a jury trial.

Appellant was not denied a right to jury trial because appellant waived a jury trial in writing in open court, and appellant's counsel did not render ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction of unlawful delivery of a simulated controlled substance. Appellant argued that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 21.06, which allowed the state to allege that an offense occurred in one county but prove that it occurred in another county, was unconstitutional. The court held that art. 21.06 did not violate appellant's right under U.S. Const. amend. VI to be informed of the nature of the accusation against him because the location of the offense was not an element of the offense charged. The court also concluded that the indictment was not unconstitutionally misleading because appellant received adequate notice of his alleged criminal acts. The court held that appellant had constructive notice that he would have to defend against proof that the offense occurred outside the prosecuting county's boundaries. The court ruled that the indictment sufficiently apprised appellant of the offense he was to defend against and did not violate his due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. V.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee individual was investigated by federal authorities that thought he might have child pornography.

Appellant state sought review of the adverse ruling, arguing that the suppression was erroneous. In reversing the decision of the trial court, the court held that anticipatory language in the warrant that contraband &quot;would be&quot; at the specified location did not invalidate the warrant; and evidence lawfully obtained by federal officers acting under a valid federal search warrant was admissible.</SPAN></P>

The court found that, although the prosecutor commented in his argument to the jury on appellant's failure to testify, the argument did not contribute to the jury's conviction of appellant. Further, the court found that declaring the error harmless would not encourage the state to repeat the argument. The court found that appellant opened the door to the prosecutor's attack of the defense attorney during closing argument and could not bring challenge on the issue. There was sufficient evidence to prove the allegations in the indictment. The court found that &sect; 481.126 was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court found that Tort Claims Act limited appellant's liability for damages for bodily injury or death to $ 100,000 for each person and $ 300,000 for each occurrence. Appellant contended that the phrase &quot;each person&quot; referred only to the person who was physically injured or killed, and because appellees claimed loss because of the death of one person, their recovery was limited to an aggregate of $ 100,000. The court found that appellant's total liability was limited to $ 100,000, apportioned among appellees pro rata. Accordingly, the judgment was modified to establish a pro rata recovery.

The court also found that the unconstitutionality of the mandated judgment delays in art. 22.16(c) did not render the entire statute unconstitutional as Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated assault and he sought review.

Const. art. 1, &sect; 3, the statutory exemption from jury service for persons over 65 years of age of Tex. Gov't Code &sect; 62.106 (1988). The court found that appellant failed to show that persons over 65 were a distinctive group with some common thread of shared experience or political, social, or religious viewpoint. The court found that even if persons over 65 were held to constitute a distinctive group, appellant failed to establish the fair cross-section requirement that the percentage of the community made up of the group was underrepresented. The court found that age was not a suspect classification requiring strict scrutiny under an equal protection analysis, and because the age-based classification was based upon a reasonable and substantial classification of persons and was rationally related to its objective, it was constitutionally permissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant partner sought review of an order from the 152nd District Court, Harris County (Texas), which dismissed appellant's cause of action regarding ownership of the land in question, and resulting and constructive trusts, granted appellee partners' motion for instructed verdict, withdrew appellant's case from the jury, and rendered judgment that appellant take nothing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the trial court's dismissal of three theories of recovery regarding appellant partner's cause of action was reversible error. Appellant contended that the partnership owned the land and sued appellee partners for breach of fiduciary duty. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in dismissing his cause of action regarding ownership of the land and constructive and resulting trusts. The court reversed the judgment. The court found no support in the law or in the record for dismissal of the ownership and resulting and constructive trust theories of recovery for failure to join a third party with a one-sixth mineral interest in the property. Based on the court's interpretation of Tex. R. Civ. P. 39, the court held that the trial court lacked authority to dismiss appellant's theories of recovery, based on failure to join an indispensable party, and should have allowed the parties to proceed to trial on appellant's theories of recovery. The court also found that appellant listing the land, as community property in his divorce did not judicially estop him because he did not testify about the property in question.</SPAN></P>

Appellant city passed an ordinance which zoned the location of alcohol-related businesses which adversely affected appellees.

Appellant sought review and asserted the trial court erred in finding the ordinance in conflict with the code, failing to find that the Texas Legislature validated the ordinance, allowing and finding standing for intervention, and failing to require a supersedeas bond. On review, the court found that the ordinance did not preempt appellant's power to zone the location of alcohol-related businesses. Further, the ordinance was within appellant's home-rule power as a city and was a valid exercise of appellant's police power. Thus, the trial court erred when it held that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court then determined that the other arguments did not need to be reviewed due to these initial findings.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16.008-.009. Appellant challenged the grant of summary judgment, arguing that the statutes of repose did not bar contract claims, and the court affirmed. With the statutes of repose, the time period began running when the improvement was substantially completed rather than when a cause of action accrued. The court held that the statutes of repose did prevent appellant's contract claims. The court deferred to the legislative recognition of the vulnerability to lawsuits of building professionals and contractors. The court also held that appellant's affirmative defense of fraudulent concealment did not apply to the statute of repose to extend appellant's time for filing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees, engineering, contracting, and masonry companies, because the applicable statutes of repose barred appellant development company's contract claims. The court also held that appellant's defense of fraudulent concealment was inapplicable to the statute of repose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision of the 337th District Court of Harris County (Texas), which convicted appellant of capital murder pursuant to an intentional killing in the course of a robbery under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2) (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant killed a cashier while attempting to rob a convenience store. The court affirmed appellant's conviction of capital murder for an intentional killing in the course of a robbery under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2) (1989). Appellant's right to due process and right to a trial by jury were not violated under U.S. Const. amend. V and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 10,19 because Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 8.04 was not unconstitutional since it was based on sound public policy that allowing intoxication to negate intent would excuse the commission of a crime by a person who voluntarily ingested alcohol or drugs and then felt free to violate the law. Appellant failed to make a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination by the state in its exercise of peremptory challenges because the record contained sufficient nonracial reasons for all three peremptory strikes. A juror who said that he would make sure appellant got a fair trial and that he would meet his civic responsibility did not demonstrate an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court by not dismissing him. The words &quot;know&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; did not need to be defined for the jury because they were easily understand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction of appellant for capital murder and held that the voluntary intoxication statute was constitutional based on public policy and the compelling interest of protecting citizens because evidence of voluntary intoxication to negate mens rea would create a high risk of perjury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of felony theft of oil field property, a trailer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle (UUMV) and was given five years of probation. While still on probation, appellant was indicted for murder and placed in jail. The trial court revoked appellant's probation on the same evidence heard by the jury in the murder trial and assessed punishment in the UUMV case at five years in prison. A jury convicted appellant of murder and sentenced him to 35 years in prison. The trial court granted the state's motion and cumulated the 35 years on the five years assessed previously. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions but reformed the judgment in the UUMV case to credit appellant's five-year sentence with the days already spent in jail and the judgment in the murder case by deleting the finding that appellant used a deadly weapon. The court also found that failure of the trial judge to include a voluntariness instruction in the charge was harmless error, that the use of the same evidence to revoke appellant's probation as was offered in the murder trial was not unconstitutional, and that double jeopardy did not apply to bar the use of the same evidence in the two proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of forgery, found two enhancement paragraphs true, and assessed punishment at 85 years confinement, though the punishment range was 25 years to life under Tex.

On a motion for rehearing following remand, appellant requested a new trial on punishment alleging that he was harmed by a parole instruction that had been held unconstitutional, but was later codified as Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) (1991). The court reviewed the factors in determining whether harm had occurred and found that the prosecution's argument that indirectly invited the jury to consider parole law in assessing punishment was the only factor supporting appellant's claim of harm. The court concluded that the error in giving the parole instruction had not contributed to appellant's punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction for forgery was affirmed because the jury was unlikely to have assessed a sentence greater than the state requested as a result of the parole instruction, and giving the parole charge made no contribution to appellant's punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator was incarcerated in Nevada. Based on an indictment in Texas, a detainer was filed and relator was transferred to Texas. After relator filed a request for final disposition, relator filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for the state's failure to bring the case to trial within 180 days as required by the Interstate Agreements on Detainers Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 51.14 (1979). The trial court denied the motion and set the case for trial. Relator requested a writ of mandamus from the appellate court to require respondent trial judge to dismiss the indictments. The appellate court granted the writ and found that respondent's duty to dismiss was ministerial rather than discretionary. The court also found that, contrary to state's argument, direct appeal was not an adequate remedy because relator would first be forced to undergo a trial, which would be a useless act. Also, the appellate court refused to find the Interstate Agreements on Detainers Act to be unconstitutional and rejected state's contention that relator was produced for trial prior to the expiration of the 180 day limit because state was required to bring relator to trial, not merely produce him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for aggravated sexual assault by the 227th District Court of Bexar County (Texas) after the child victim was permitted to testify using closed-circuit television.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was tried for sexual assault, and the trial court permitted the child victim to testify via closed-circuit television. Appellant was convicted and filed this appeal. The appellate court affirmed the conviction. The court determined that the testimony by closed-circuit television was permissible because the trial judge made findings of fact and conclusions of law that showed the child would suffer undue psychological harm if forced to testify in court and that the system provided for two-way communication, which satisfied appellant's right of confrontation and cross-examination. The appellate court agreed that the procedure protected appellant's due process rights. The court pointed to an instruction by the trial judge stating that no adverse inference was to be drawn from the fact that the child testified using the closed-circuit system. Finally, appellant's argument that evidence of extraneous offenses was improperly admitted was not preserved for review. Appellant did not make a specific objection in accordance with Tex. R. Evid. 403 that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for aggravated sexual assault because the testimony of the child victim via closed-circuit television did not violate appellant's due process rights, and appellant's objection concerning the admission of extraneous offenses was not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the decision of the County Court at Law No. 1 of Calhoun County, Texas, which granted appellee individuals' motion to quash on constitutional grounds the state's charge of taking oysters from polluted waters, a violation of Tex. Parks &amp; Wild. Code Ann. &sect; 76.116(a) (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were charged with taking oysters from polluted waters but the trial court dismissed the charges, finding the statute unconstitutional. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the trial court's order could not have been based on the statutes' application to the individuals charged, as none of the appellees testified or presented any evidence to show their particular situation. The court held that Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 436.012(d) did not shift the burden of proof to a defendant, but to one who seeks to take oysters and to determine whether an area is open or closed and concluded that the state was still required to show in a prosecution that a defendant was taking oysters from a closed are. The court found Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 436.012 and Tex. Parks &amp; Wild. Code Ann. &sect; 76.116 constitutional and not void for vagueness because one statute permits the Health Commissioner to declare areas polluted, and the other statute prohibited the taking of oysters from these waters. The court found that on their face, these statutes provided notice of the forbidden conduct in terms which persons of common intelligence could reasonably understand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the sections of the statutes in question were constitutional and reversed and remanded the causes to the trial court because one statute permitted the health commissioner to declare areas polluted and the other prohibited the taking of oysters from the prohibited areas.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged the decision of the 234th District Court of Harris County (Texas), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee employer in appellant's cause of action against appellee for employer's negligence, gross negligence, intentionally failing to furnish a safe workplace, and intentionally inflicted emotional distress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee brought an action against appellee employer for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell at her workplace, a restaurant owned by appellee. Appellant received workers' compensation benefits for the injuries she sustained in the fall, and she also sued appellee for gross negligence and asserted an intentional tort claim. The court affirmed the summary judgment on the negligence cause of action because pursuant to the exclusive remedies doctrine, an employee who received workers' compensation benefits could not bring suit for injuries caused by an employer's negligence or gross negligence, but only for the employer's intentional torts. The court reversed and remanded on the intentional tort cause of action. Since an intentional tort claim was not alleged until after the motion for summary judgment was filed, and appellee failed to amend its motion for summary judgment to include this cause, appellee did not specifically address or dispose expressly of the intentional tort cause of action. Thus, appellee did not sustain its burden with respect to the intentional tort claim, and final summary judgment was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted on three counts of indecency with a child under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.11 and received an enhanced concurrent prison sentence under Tex. Penal Code Ann &sect; 12.42(b) of 45 years, 45 years and 20 years. Appellant raised numerous points of error at trial including misjoinder of offenses, denial of speedy trial rights and finding complainant competent to testify. The court affirmed the conviction and sentencing and on appellant's speedy trial point found that he filed numerous pre-trial motions, was notably uncooperative with two different court-appointed attorneys and had ample time to prepare a defense around possible testimony of complainant's mother who died in an accident several days before trial. The court held joinder of offenses was proper because two or more of the offenses arose out of the same criminal episode under Tex. Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 21.24 (1989), Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;3.01and &sect; 21.11(a)(1)(2). The court found no abuse of discretion in determining complainant competent to testify but disallowing appellant to examine her during competency hearing because competency is a question for the court, not for the parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state education agency and various local school districts, sought review of the judgment of the 17th District Court of Tarrant County (Texas), which found in favor of appellees, home school parents, in a class action suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 37.001 (1986), and awarded appellees a declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction, and attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellants, state education agency and various local school districts, had prosecuted over 150 parents as violators of the state's compulsory attendance law, appellees, home school parents, brought suit. The trial court issued declaratory relief by construing the compulsory exemption statute to include home schooled children and permanently enjoined any further prosecutions and awarded attorney's fees to appellees. On review, the court affirmed the trial court's judgments, finding that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to construe and enjoin enforcement of Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 37.001 (1986), because it was a criminal statute; but that appellees' equal protection rights were violated, because the difference between a student receiving a private education from a &quot;private school&quot; environment versus a &quot;home school&quot; environment was not rationally related to the state's compulsory education law. Consequently, the court held that appellants were not immune from suit under 42 U.S.C.S. 1983, and that the evidence was sufficient to support the class-wide injunctive relief, the declaratory judgment, and the attorney's fees award pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the declaratory, injunctive, and attorney's fee awards in favor of appellee home school parents, because appellants, state education agency and various local school districts, had violated appellees' equal protection rights, by holding, in essence, that home schools were not exempt from compulsory public education, and because the evidence was sufficient to support the foregoing awards.</SPAN></P>

He claimed that because the substance he delivered was not contraband, he was being punished solely for speech, i.e., for falsely representing to a buyer that it was contraband. The reviewing court upheld the conviction. When challenging the constitutionality of a statute, it is incumbent upon a defendant to show that in its operation the statute is unconstitutional to him in his situation; that it may be unconstitutional to others is insufficient. Here, appellant's judicial confession included one method of committing the offense that did not involve speech. Thus, his right to free speech was not infringed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was a campaign worker and assisted someone in filling out an absentee voting ballot. Appellant was charged and found guilty of unlawful assistance to a voter. Appellant sought review, argued insufficient evidence, unconstitutionally overbroad and vague language in the charging statute, a defective jury charge, error in the admission of evidence, and improper jury argument. On review, the court found that corroboration existed to the story that appellant committed the offense and a rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, sufficient evidence existed to support the jury's verdict of guilty. The court examined the statute at issue and found that it was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. The court found that appellant did not suffer egregious harm from any error in the jury charge. The court determined that the evidence of extraneous offenses committed by third parties was not properly preserved and that error was waived.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A child said that defendant sexually abused her. Several witnesses testified that the child showed symptoms of sexual abuse and that she said that defendant abused her. Defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault. Defendant objected to the admission of video interviews of the child, hearsay, and jury instructions. The court overruled the evidence objections and remanded due to punishment phase errors. On reconsideration of the evidentiary complaints, the court held that defendant was not deprived of any constitutional rights because the state admitted videos and presented the child for cross-examination in accord with 1983 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 599, &sect; 1. The aunt's testimony was inadmissible hearsay because a proper predicate was not laid to admit the statements as the first statements made by a victim to an adult. Statements to the mother were not admissible as prior consistent statements because they were not made prior to alleged improper influence. Statements to the pediatrician and therapist were admissible as pertinent to diagnosis and treatment. The court held the hearsay errors did not affect conviction or punishment and again remanded for a punishment hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded defendant's criminal case for a new punishment hearing in accord with a prior ruling by the court. The court held that harmless error occurred when the trial court erroneously admitted the hearsay testimony of the mother and aunt, which did not affect defendant's conviction and punishment due to the same evidence being properly admitted through other witnesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction by the 178th District Court, Harris County (Texas) of voluntary manslaughter. Appellant pled not guilty on an indictment for murder, and the jury found him guilty of voluntary manslaughter and assessed punishment at 20 years' confinement. Appellant asserted error based on the state's closing argument during the punishment stage of trial, and the trial court's jury instruction on the law of parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his jury conviction for voluntary manslaughter for shooting the victim during the course of an argument. He claimed that that the trial court committed reversible error by denying his motion for a mistrial after the state invited the jury to speculate on extraneous offenses during summation. The court rejected the argument, noting that the trial judge sustained two objections to the summation and issued a curative instruction to the jury to disregard the improper argument. The court also rejected appellant's argument that the jury charge on parole was unconstitutional because it invited the jury to base its punishment decision on the possibility of parole, relying on a 1987 judicial decision. The court noted that Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11(a), approved in 1989, authorized legislation to permit courts to instruct juries regarding the possibility of parole. In this case, the court held that the jury instruction on parole was in complete compliance with the constitutional amendment and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 (1990), which was enacted to implement the constitutional amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence, holding that the trial court's jury instruction cured any harm arising from the prosecutor's improper summation during the punishment phase of trial, and that the jury instruction on parole was entirely consistent with applicable statutory and constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a pro se action in forma pauperis claiming that defendants, employees of the department of criminal justice, used prison regulations to deny him &quot;legal visits&quot; with other prisoners and the use of a law book. Before defendants were served with process the trial court dismissed the cause as frivolous pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 13.001 (1991). The court held that the trial court properly dismissed appellant's claims based on the state statutes because the action's realistic chance of ultimate success was slight. However, the court found that appellant's petition had raised a potential 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim for a violation of his rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and it was impossible to tell from appellant's petition whether his 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim had a realistic chance of success. Because prison inmates' complaints were to be construed liberally, the court held that appellant's allegations were sufficient to allege a violation of his constitutional rights and summary dismissal without affording him a hearing was unreasonable.

Appellant argued that Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 23.56(3) (1982) violated Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1-d-1, Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, and the equal protection clauses of the United States and Texas Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was denied, by appellees, the county tax appraisal unit, an open-space land designation, which would have reduced the taxes on the property, on the grounds of Tex.

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that the eligibility limitation excluding non-resident aliens from qualifying for the open-space land designation furthered &sect; 1-d-1's goal of preserving and benefiting the family farm. The court further held that the classification for tax purposes did not result in the denial of equal protection where it rested upon policy considerations having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation and where a rational basis existed for assessing the value of agricultural land owned by non-resident aliens differently.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, appellant had previously been identified in a police line-up. Therefore, the court held that the trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed the offense of murder of the victim. The court further held that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that they could consider the existence of good conduct time and parole in determining appellant's sentence because under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.03, &sect;4 a jury charge that included a parole instruction was no longer unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty to 12 separate charges of aggravated robbery and for escape while being confined on the robbery cases. Defendant subsequently appealed his conviction challenging the validity of his plea, the jury charge, a defect in the escape indictment, and error in the prosecutor's jury argument. The appellate court found that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.13(c) (1989) required substantial compliance by the court with, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.13 (1989), admonishment requirements. Defendant signed a document containing admonishments and orally acknowledged that he understood the consequences of his plea. Substantial compliance was satisfied. Defendant did not raise the issue of his competency at the time of his plea and because the court had no reason to question competency, the court was not obligated to make an inquiry into mental competency. A jury instruction regarding consideration of good conduct and application of the parole law complied with Tex. Const. art. 17, &sect; 1. The prosecutor's jury argument was a reasonable deduction from the evidence and an appropriate plea for law enforcement. Therefore, defendant's convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for 12 counts of aggravated robbery and for escape while he was confined for the robbery charges was affirmed. The trial court substantially complied with statutory admonishment requirements, defendant's competency was not raised as an issue nor was there reason for the court to consider it an issue, jury instructions were constitutional, and the prosecutor's jury argument was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also granted appellees' motion for partial summary judgment against appellant civic club, finding it had no standing to sue. The court reversed, finding that appellant civic club had standing to sue under Tex. Prop.

Additionally, the court rejected appellees affirmative defense of waiver, finding there was no evidence to support the jury's finding because other deed restriction violations alleged by appellees could not be evidence of waiver as a matter of law. The laches defense was rejected because the instruction to the jury failed to require the jury to find that appellees detrimentally relied on appellants' delay.

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.052(a)(2) (1989), after buying marihuana from an undercover officer. The conviction was affirmed on appeal. The court held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.052(a)(2) was not unconstitutionally vague because the conduct proscribed was stated in terms that could be readily understood by a person of common intelligence, and when applied to appellant's specific conduct, the terms were not vague at all. The statute furthermore provided sufficient notice to law enforcement personnel so as to prevent arbitrary enforcement. The court likewise held that the indictment, which tracked the statutory language, sufficiently alleged enough to enable appellant to prepare a defense. The indictment's supposed deficiencies were merely evidentiary facts the state was not required to plead. Finally, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain his conviction because a rational trier of fact could find appellant invested funds and thereby intended to further possession of the marihuana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile was 17 when he was referred to the juvenile probation department for selling cocaine.

The juvenile court ordered a diagnostic study, social evaluation, and full investigation of appellant, his circumstances, and the circumstances of the alleged offense under Tex. Fam.

Code Ann. &sect;54.02(f) (1986) did not direct the juvenile court to evaluate the quality of the treatment services offered in determining whether to waive its jurisdiction. Further, the court found that the evidence of the unavailability of rehabilitative services suitable for appellant and the unwillingness of appellant to be rehabilitated showed that there was little likelihood the facilities and services available to the juvenile court could have reasonably been expected to rehabilitate appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged her conviction by the District Court of Galveston County, Texas, after the trial court denied her motion to suppress evidence. Appellant waived her right to a jury trial, entered a plea of not guilty, and stipulated to the evidence. The district judge found her guilty of possession of more than 28 grams of a controlled substance, methamphetamine, and sentenced her to confinement for eight years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an affidavit submitted in support of a search warrant, a city peace officer asserted he had credible information that appellant had methamphetamine in her home, located outside city limits. The judge issued a search warrant for the premises, which was executed by the affiant and other officers, who found methamphetamine. Appellant was convicted of possession of more than 28 grams of a controlled substance, methamphetamine, and contended on appeal that her motion to suppress the evidence was denied in error. She argued that the search warrant was issued to and executed by a peace officer acting outside his jurisdiction, and was not supported by probable cause. The court disagreed, holding that it made no difference that the affidavit was signed by a city police officer rather than a county deputy sheriff. Further, the warrant named a location outside city limits in the county, and at least one of the peace officers who executed the warrant, and whose name was listed in the return, was a sheriff's deputy with jurisdiction to execute the warrant. Finally, the court rejected appellant's argument that the warrant was not supported by probable cause, and affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer sought certification under Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.79D (1991) to recover offsets against its state obligations for expenses incurred in bringing antifraud actions. A trial court held that article 21.79D was unconstitutional, granting appellee State Board of Insurance's summary judgment motion. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because article 21.79D violated the retroactive law prohibition of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, and was void. By its plain language, article 21.79D imposed on the state the obligation to offset debts that an insurer owed to the state, by the amount of costs and attorney's fees incurred by the insurer with respect to transactions, which occurred before the passage of the statute. The court found that the assessments and debts owed by the insurer to the state were vested rights of the state, which could not be impaired by a retroactive law. Appellee adequately and thoroughly presented the various legal reasons why article 21.79D was unconstitutional in its motion for summary judgment. The court rejected appellant's contention that appellee did not have standing to contend that article 21.79D was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

In attacks made on the grounds of illegality, the court found a construction prohibition under Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 361.067 (1991) applied only to municipal jails, not county jails. The court also found a claim of illegality could not be based on Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 351.105 (repealed 1991) because &sect; 351.105 was repealed. Furthermore, the court held a claim of illegality based on the appointment of a private corporation to build the jail was incontestable as a matter of law. Finally, the court overruled plaintiffs' remaining illegality claim because expenditures had not violated Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect; 51 and Tex. Const. art. 11, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment granting defendants, county, corporation, and partnership, summary judgment because defendant corporation's appearance in the suit pursuant to its motion for summary judgment remedied a delayed original answer, and plaintiff taxpayers lacked standing to attack jail construction on public policy and abuse of discretion grounds, while plaintiffs' claims of illegality were overruled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a class of Texas public school children, and defendant education agency both appealed the judgment of the 334th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which denied plaintiffs' challenge, on federal and state grounds, of Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 21.920 (1987) and the related 19 Tex. Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, Texas public school children, filed suit against defendant education agency challenging Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 21.920 (1987) and 19 Tex. Admin. Code &sect; 97.113 (1988) (the &quot;no pass, no play rule&quot;), which plaintiffs argued discriminated against handicapped persons in violation of the Education of Handicapped Act (EHA), 20 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1401, and against minority students in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000d. The trial court denied the challenge and assessed defendant costs. Both parties appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court lacked jurisdiction to review plaintiffs' injunctive relief application, as they did not exhaust their administrative remedies under the EHA. Because handicapped students who had not met their individual education plan were not a suspect class, the standard of review was rational basis, which the statute satisfied. Plaintiffs' substantive due process claim failed because there was not a constitutional right to participate in extracurricular activities. Plaintiffs were not entitled to injunctive relief because they did not show that the legislature's stated purpose for the rule was merely a pretext.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment against the challenge by plaintiffs, Texas public school children, to the &quot;no-pass, no play rule&quot; as applied to minority and learning disabled children because they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies under the statute and the statute met the applicable rational basis test. Because defendant education agency failed to preserve its point of error as to the assessment of costs, the court overruled it.</SPAN></P>

Art. 22.021 (1989) and sentenced to life in prison following complainant's in-court identification. On appeal, nothing was preserved for review in appellant's claim of prosecutorial misconduct because appellant failed to object so that the trial court was not given an opportunity to make a ruling on the alleged prosecutorial misconduct. The court affirmed because the trial court did not err in admitting complainant's in-court identification of appellant, and viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the verdict, a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was the perpetrator of the offense. There was no evidence to suggest that the complainant's in-court identification of appellant was tainted by a pretrial photographic array. The court added that a trial court instruction adequately informed the jurors of their duty to determine the reliability of all of the evidence, without singling out any particular evidence. The court found appellant's argument that DNA evidence had an exaggerated impact on the jury to be without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff representatives of certified class of public school children brought an action against defendant Texas Education Agency. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief from Tex. Educ.

Plaintiffs argued that &sect; 21.920 discriminated against handicapped students, violated the Education of Handicapped Act (EHA), 20 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1401 (1991) and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The trial court denied recovery and ordered that defendant Texas Education Agency pay the master appointed by the trial court to collect data on the impact of &sect; 21.920. The court reversed the order for the master's payment because the trial court lacked good cause. The court otherwise affirmed the judgment and held that administrative remedies had not been exhausted under EHA, and, thus, the court did not have jurisdiction. Further, the court held that &sect; 21.920 was rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in providing education and that there was no constitutional right to participate in extracurricular activities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Using ordinary bicycle locks, appellant protesters chained their necks together at an abortion clinic so they could not be moved without being injured. Indicted for the unlawful use of a criminal instrument under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 16.01 (1991), appellants sought habeas corpus relief claiming that the indictments were defective because they did not allege an offense. The trial court denied relief. On appeal, the court found that a bicycle lock did not become a criminal instrument by the context of its use. The court concluded that a criminal instrument was determined by the limited nature and specialized criminal use of its own distinctive properties. In using the phrase &quot;by locking herself up to,&quot; the court found that appellee state was describing the conduct of appellants' use of the instrument in the commission of a trespass, rather than charging how the &quot;character&quot; of the instrument was adapted to suit the criminal design. Reversing the denial of relief and ordering the indictments dismissed, the court held that the mere locking of a bicycle lock did not constitute a special adaptation of the lock, as required by &sect; 16.01, and that the indictments were defective.</SPAN></P>

Contrary to appellant's assertion, the court found that Tex. Prop. Code Ann. &sect; 21.021 (1984) permitted appellee to deposit the award with the court and fix the date of taking. Appellant also contended that the taking for a drainage ditch decreased the value of his remaining property.

The court also held that appellant's indictments sufficiently alleged the elements necessary to charge him with fraud in connection with the sale of securities. The court further held that there was no error in refusing to provide a mistake-of-fact defense instruction, inasmuch as appellant failed to introduce evidence that his mistake was reasonable and negated the culpable mental state required for the crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant surety executed a bond on behalf of a client. The client failed to appear at a hearing, so the trial court ordered the bond forfeited. The trial court signed a judgment nisi and issued a citation.

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 22.02. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. Evidence established that notice of the hearing was sent to appellant. As required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 22.13, appellant failed to show sufficient cause for the client's failure to appear. The judgment nisi provided sufficient proof that the trial court complied with the requirements of article 22.02.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant appealed an order of the 23rd District Court, Brazoria County, Texas, which denied his petition for writ of habeas corpus. Appellant alleged that his indictment for the offense of possession of a controlled substance while he was in the confines of property belonging to the Texas Department of Corrections was void because the pertinent statute,&nbsp;Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 499.004 (1990), violated Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's denial of his writ of habeas corpus finding that in determining if a bill included more than one subject, the constitutional provision and the statute were to be liberally construed in favor of constitutionality. The court found that it was not unconstitutional in providing for criminal penalties for the possession of controlled substance in the prison system included in an act relating to the management of Texas prisons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance, marijuana, and received deferred adjudication and subsequently sentenced to 17 years confinement after probation revocation hearing. On appeal, defendant argued that his right to due process was violated because the trial judge was not neutral and detached magistrate and that he was not afforded effective assistance of counsel. The court affirmed and held that if final adjudication was deferred, the decision to finally enter judgment was not reviewable, and that the remainder of the proceedings were subject to ordinary review. The court held that even if it was error for the trial judge to preside over the part of the hearing dealing with aggravated perjury, such error was harmless. The court held that it would not second-guess trial strategy of defense counsel and that probable harm was not shown.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of possession of a controlled substance, marijuana, because no appeal could be taken from the trial court's determination after a hearing to proceed with an adjudication of guilt on the original charge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asbestos manufacturers raised 35 points on appeal of the trial court's award of damages to plaintiff workers in plaintiffs' actions for strict liability for failure to warn. Defendants argued that evidence for future medical expenses and punitive damages did not support those awards, and that the trial court erred in not directing verdict or entering judgment n.o.v. The court held that if one plaintiff did not make a remittitur of his future medical expense award, his case would be retried because he failed to show a reasonable probability. The court also ruled that the evidence did not show conscious indifference by one defendant and set aside that portion of the award of punitive damages. The court otherwise affirmed. Plaintiffs established that the dangers of asbestos were reasonably foreseeable or discoverable at the time of exposure. As to the denial of the motion for directed verdict, the court held that the question was whether the evidence adduced at the time the plaintiffs rested, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, raised an issue for the jury. The court ruled that sufficient evidence supported the verdict and that other errors were harmless.</SPAN></P>
