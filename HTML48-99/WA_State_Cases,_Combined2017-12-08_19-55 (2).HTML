</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was one of the 84 eligible casual laborers considered for seniority, but because his total rating score was not among the top 44, he was not selected for seniority employment. The employee filed a grievance with the union pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement's grievance and arbitration procedure for disputes involving the application or interpretation of the agreement. Finding no violations in the selection process, the union decided not to pursue the grievance. The employee then brought a civil action against the port district. The port district filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court concluded that the employee's discrimination claims were deemed to allege an unfair labor practice under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.56.140(1), and that his claims were barred by the running of the Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.56.160 limitation period and his failure to exhaust administrative remedies available through the Washington Public Employment Relations Commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher challenged his employment discharge and was given a hearing before a hearing examiner and review committee. The examiner and committee recommended dismissal to the board of trustees. The board adopted the recommendation and terminated the teacher's employment for cause. The teacher contended that his dismissal impermissibly resulted from his having exercised his constitutionally protected right to free speech. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the grounds for dismissal were not constitutionally protected actions and were supported by the facts. The college showed by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision in the absence of the protected conduct. Given the substantial testimony regarding the teacher's lengthy history of criticism and profanity and the college's efforts to deal with the problems, the court concluded that the college had met its burden. Accordingly, the teacher's dismissal did not violate his First Amendment right to free speech. The teacher's continued use of profane language and criticism of other instructors after repeated direction by his superiors constituted insubordination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant revenue department challenged the judgment from the Superior Court, Thurston County (Washington), which determined that respondent taxpayer should be classified, for business and occupation (B&amp;O) tax purposes, as an abstract, title insurance and escrow business under Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 458-20-156, instead of as an insurance agent under Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 458-20-164.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The revenue department assessed a deficiency against the taxpayer based on its determination that the taxpayer was classified as an insurance agent for purposes of B&amp;O tax. The taxpayer appealed to the superior court. The superior court entered judgment for the taxpayer and determined that it should have been classified as an abstract, title insurance, and escrow business. The court affirmed the judgment. The real issue was not how the insurance commissioner licensed the taxpayer, but how the legislature intended to classify the taxpayer for B &amp; O tax purposes. When Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.04.260(14), the insurance agent classification statute, was read in conjunction with the definitions in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 48.17, it was apparent that the legislature did not intend that title insurance agents be classified as insurance agents for B &amp; O tax purposes. The definition of &quot;agent&quot; set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 48.17.010 did not fit what the taxpayer did. Moreover, the classification sought by the revenue department was inconsistent with the law requiring the equitable application of the B&amp;O tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a petition that alleged the child, then age two, was being abused or neglected by her parents. An emergency room physician was allowed to testify about statements the child made to him when he examined her at the emergency room, and a medical social worker from the same hospital was allowed to testify about the child's statements to her in an interview. The statements indicated that the father had abused the child. The trial court concluded that there was a manifest danger to the child if she was not removed. Upon review, the court affirmed. It found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.130 did not violate due process or equal protection principles. The court determined that the evidence of the child's statements to the physician and the medical social worker were not inadmissible hearsay. It found that Wash. R. Evid. 803(a)(4) was not limited to physicians and that statements made to hospital employees also fell within the rule. The court concluded that the trial court was within its discretion to refuse to allow the parents to bring the child to the courtroom for a demonstration of how she interacted with the father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners' plat applications were disapproved by the county for failure to conform to King County, Wash. Code &sect; 19.26.290(F). On appeal, the county argued in support of its change in the interpretation and application of the ordinance to prevent over-development of the area, and to respond to increased traffic congestion. The court held that the county did not have any particular rules or standards for the determination of when an area was so developed that it was necessary for additional short plats to be accessed by public roads. The court held that the discretion sought by the county was too broad, but the court approved of the county's purpose to limit development. The court held that the means selected must be consistent with the regulations regarding development that the county has adopted. The court further held that the denial of the respondents' applications interfered with their use of their real property and it was error for the trial court to dismiss their claims.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 36.21.080.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers owned land subject to the valuation procedures under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.21.080(1). The statute allowed assessors to place newly constructed improvements to real property on the assessment rolls up to August 31 of each year and required such improvements to be valued as of July 31 of that year. The taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of the statute and sought to enjoin the county assessor from using any assessment based on a July 31 valuation date to compute the following year's tax. The trial court found the statute constitutional, denied the taxpayers' motion, and entered summary judgment for respondents. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the provisions of a specific, more recently enacted statute prevailed in any conflict with the general statute; therefore, the new construction statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.21.080, prevailed over the provisions of the general assessment statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 84.40.020. The court held that the new construction statute did not violate the Uniformity Clause of the state constitution under Wash. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the unfettered discretion of the prosecutor to charge DWR-HTO cases in either the district or superior court subjected them to differing penalties for the same conduct because deferred prosecution was available only in the district court. One defendant had availed himself of a deferred prosecution in the previous five years and so the court did not reach his claim because he was ineligible for deferred prosecution. However, the court agreed with the argument in the case of the other defendant. The same conduct subjected him to different penalties at the sole discretion of the prosecutor. The court also held that the statute giving the prosecutor the option to charge in either court violated the separation of powers doctrine. Deferred prosecution was a sentencing alternative and therefore at least partially a judicial act. Allowing the prosecutor to veto the judge's discretionary sentencing determination by charging in a court where the alternative was not available violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal of the first defendant, who was ineligible for deferred prosecution, but reversed the conviction of the second defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order that the company pay additional premiums was based in part on a determination that its employees should have been reclassified from office employees to manufacturing employees because their duties required them to be exposed to manufacturing operations. Obviously a clerical employee who was not exposed to any operative hazards was in a lower risk category than one who was so exposed. The application of the Department of Labor and Industries consisted of two rules, the &quot;merely fortuitous rule&quot; and the &quot;duties rule.&quot; The duties rule was consistent with the literal language of Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 296-17-440, and its use had not constituted an amendment to that Code. As the company had no presently existing substantial interest in having a merely fortuitous rule set aside, it did not have standing to challenge it. The void for vagueness test was only appropriate with regard to a regulatory statute that prohibited certain types of conduct and imposed sanctions for violations. Applying the rational basis test, the court found that the company's right to equal protection had not been denied. There were reasonable grounds for both aspects of the application of &sect; 296-17-440.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certain of the taxicab company's drivers were cited for violations of the fixed rate provision of &sect; 6.64.090. When the County Board of Appeals upheld the issuance of the citations, the taxicab company brought an action against the County seeking a declaration that the rate provisions of &sect; 6.64.090 were unconstitutional in that it was an impermissible exercise of the police power and that it conflicted with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 81.72.210. The trial court granted summary judgment for the County, dismissing the taxicab company's action and declaring that King County, Wash., Code &sect; 6.64.090 was constitutional. The taxicab company appealed. The court held that summary judgment for the County was proper. Section 6.64.090 was a valid exercise of the police power. It was enacted to correct the evil of rate gouging by taxicabs and it bore a reasonable and substantial relationship to correcting that evil. Moreover, &sect; 6.64.090 was not unconstitutional because it conflicted with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 81.72.210 because there was no inherent conflict between the ordinance and the statute. The ordinance did not in any way forbid the cities from doing what &sect; 81.72.210 authorized them to do.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with and convicted of committing indecent liberties with his daughter. Defendant challenged the conviction, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting the child's hearsay statements, and the court affirmed. The court held that the child's testimony was properly admitted pursuant to the requirements of the child sexual abuse hearsay exception, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.120. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the child was unavailable as a witness within the meaning of &sect; 9A.44.120 because she was incompetent to testify. Further, the time, content, and circumstances of the statements provided sufficient indicia of reliability. Finally, the trial court correctly determined that the child's behavior at day care was sufficient to meet the corroboration element of &sect; 9A.44.120.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree rape. He had been convicted of rape five years earlier in another country. Three years before that conviction, defendant was convicted of escape in another state. The trial court found that the foreign rape conviction did not meet the requirements of the United States Constitution in that defendant's trial was conducted before a panel of only two jurors. Instead, the court assigned defendant an offender score of one, counting only the escape conviction. Defendant argued that the escape conviction, equivalent to a Class C felony, should have been &quot;washed out&quot; under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.360(2) because the foreign conviction was found to be invalid. The State contended that both prior convictions should be included in the offender score calculation and that the trial court erred in excluding the foreign conviction. Reversing, the court held that the trial court properly did not count the foreign conviction because of the number of jurors. Therefore, the court held that defendant spent five consecutive years in the community without being convicted of any felonies, thus the trial court should have &quot;washed out&quot; the escape conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant licensee challenged the decision from the Superior Court for King County (Washington), which affirmed the decision by respondent Horse Racing Commission, which itself affirmed the decision by the stewards' board that revoked the licensee's racehorse ownership license. The licensee contended that her right to marry was infringed and that she did not have sufficient notice that misrepresentation would lead to a sanction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee's husband had a drug conviction and was disqualified from horserace ownership. The licensee maintained a separate identity from her husband, including matters related to horse racing. In fact, she stated that she did not know that the husband had a criminal record. The licensee misrepresented on the license form that she was single. The appellate court reversed and remanded. The right to marry was a fundamental right that could only be restricted in exceptional circumstances. The court held that the regulations were not narrowly tailored to meet the state interest of maintaining the integrity of the horse racing industry. Further, the policy of rehabilitation had to be considered. Moreover, the aforementioned facts showed that the husband played no role in his wife's business. The court also held that a license could not be revoked without due process. The lack of integrity claim based on the false application failed because it was not until the hearing stage before the Commission that the licensee had notice that the misrepresentation would be an issue. Attorney fees were not available to the licensee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating a municipal ordinance prohibiting naturally grown fences exceeding eight feet in height. The conviction was reversed and the case dismissed based on a finding that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. Reversing the dismissal and remanding to the trial court for sentencing, the court found that the ordinance was not vague. Clyde Hill, Wash. Mun. Code &sect; 17.36.160 limited constructed fences to six feet and naturally grown fences to eight feet. Section 17.08.200 defined a fence, and &sect; 17.08.010(c) listed an approved dictionary in case a definition was not given in the ordinance. The definition of a fence was the same in the ordinance and the dictionary. A fence was a common thing, the definitions were straightforward, no guessing at its meaning was required, and a person of ordinary intelligence would not necessarily differ as to its application. Although defendant argued that he did not intend the trees to be a fence but, rather, to be a part of the yard landscaping, the ordinance was violated by the presence of a naturally grown fence over eight feet in height, regardless of the specific intent of the owner.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a declaratory judgment on appellants' state constitution claim, which did not entitle them to attorney's fees, but dismissed their &sect; 1983 claim, which would have entitled them to attorney's fees.

The court held that the state energy code did not violate equal protection and found that the separate classification of the city was rational because as a larger city, it was able to make a contribution to energy code development. The court rejected appellants' argument that the city was collaterally estopped from challenging their equal protection claim.

The auditor obtained a writ of mandamus for the reinstatement of the accountant. The auditor later lost in elections and the new auditor did not seek to hire an accountant. The court reversed the judgment. Because statute did not require the accountant position, the writ of mandamus was improper.

Rev. Code &sect; 29.07.030 (1965) violated the equal protection guaranties of the United States and Washington Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county auditor advised the cities and towns of the county of his intent to seek reimbursement under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 29.07.030 (1965) for the actual costs of voter registration and registered voter file maintenance for the residents of cities and towns located within the county. Appellants argued that &sect; 29.07.030 violated the Equal Protection amendment to the United States and Washington Constitutions, that the registration expense to be paid was invalid because it is a tax rather than a fee, and that the &quot;tax&quot; was an indirect poll tax and is therefore unconstitutional. The trial court rejected these arguments. Affirming, the court held that in the absence of any facts demonstrating double payment by property owners in cities and towns or the potential therefor, the trial court properly refused to award the relief requested. The court found that the reimbursement procedure was meant to pay actual costs of specific regulatory actions, thus the reimbursements were a fee and not a tax. The court held that appellants failed to point out how the reimbursement procedure constituted any impediment to an individual's right to vote or ability to participate in an election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a district court found defendant guilty of harassment, a Superior Court for Lewis County (Washington) affirmed his conviction. Defendant then sought and was granted discretionary review to determine the issue of whether Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.45.020 was unconstitutional on its face because it was vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty under &sect; 9A.45.020, which provided that a person was guilty of harassment if he threatened to cause bodily injury to another person without lawful authority. Defendant argued that the phrase without lawful authority was vague, thereby rendering the statute unconstitutional in violation of the due process clauses of the state and federal Constitutions. The court held that &sect; 9A.45.020 was not unconstitutionally vague. The court noted that it was required to determine whether the statute provided fair notice of the conduct that it prohibited and whether the statute contained ascertainable standards that permitted authority figures to decide what was prohibited depending on the facts of a particular case. With respect to fair notice, the court reasoned that a person of common intelligence would be able to understand what type of activity was prohibited by &sect; 9A.45.020. In addition, because police, courts, and juries could look to statutes and the common law to add definition to the meaning of the phrase lawful authority, the court also determined that the specific conduct covered by the harassment statute was not entirely dependent on an officer's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the lower court's judgment of dismissal. The court found that her claim that the dismissal was improper failed to cite any authority to support her contention. The court held that the procedures required under the statute were mandatory, and compliance was a condition precedent to recover. Former section 4.92.110 did not violate the equal protection clause because Wash. Cost. Art. 2, &sect; 26 provided that the legislature shall direct by law, in what manner, and in what courts, claims could have been brought against the state. The court also noted that the state was not equitably estopped from raising &sect; 4.92.110 because there was no advice or communication from the state on which the mother relied in failing to timely file her claim under former &sect; 4.92.110.</SPAN></P>

The county sheriff instituted forfeiture proceedings against property used in the claimants' drug trafficking business. The claimants elected for a hearing.

The court held that Wash. Rev.

The court held that because the danger of false claims following forfeiture proceedings was substantial, the requirement that the claimants first show an ownership interest was reasonable. The court concluded that the county sheriff was not entitled to attorney fees because the provision for attorneys fees under Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organization filed a petition to terminate the mother's parental rights to her two children because she suffered from a manic-depressive illness with acute manic phases.

The court affirmed, holding that the statutory standard of proof requirements satisfied due process and that there was sufficient evidence supporting the termination of parental rights. The court noted that the clear, cogent, and convincing weight of evidence was that the mother would have suffered similar episodes in the future, and when she did, she would have been an extreme danger to her children. The court concluded that prior dependency adjudications based upon the preponderance of the evidence comported with the due process rights of the parties to a termination proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Superior Court for Whatcom County (Washington), which convicted him under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.19.130 (1975) of failing to appear for the second day of trial on a charge against him of possession of stolen property. Defendant was subsequently convicted and sentenced on that charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sole excuse for his failure to appear was that he went out on the town on the night preceding the second day of trial and became so severely intoxicated as to require hospitalization. The principal issue raised by the appeal was whether or not a person who failed to appear before a court after release on personal recognizance should be charged with a crime pursuant to &sect; 10.19.130, as was defendant, or pursuant to a later legislative enactment, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.170 (1976). In reversing the decision, the court held that the later legislative enactment, &sect; 9A.76.170, repealed Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.19.130 (1975) by implication. The court followed the reasoning and conclusion of an attorney general's opinion. The court found, therefore, that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.170 (1976) covered the entire subject matter of the earlier legislation, was complete in itself, and was evidently intended to supersede the prior legislation. The court also found that the two acts were so clearly inconsistent with and repugnant to each other that they could not be reconciled and both be given effect with reasonable construction.</SPAN></P>

The employer and the state filed motions for summary judgment, which were granted by the trial court. The employee appealed. The court held that the employee's suit against the employer and against the state was barred by the Industrial Insurance Act (Act), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.04.010 et seq, which provided an exclusive remedy for workers injured in the course of their employment and did not provide a private cause of action against the state. The court found that the employee failed to produce any evidence of a specific intent to injure on the part of the employer, as required under the Act, therefore the claim against the employer failed.

On appeal, defendant contended that the state failed to prove that he was armed and challenged the constitutionality of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA) under which the trial court used a juvenile conviction to calculate his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's accomplice had a gun in a zippered pocket of his shirt during the burglary. The police did not discover the gun during the pat down search. On appeal, defendant contended that the state had to prove that he knew that his accomplice was armed. The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction. Defendant also contended that the trial court's use of his pre-SRA juvenile offenses to calculate the sentence for his post-SRA adult crime violated the ex post facto provisions of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 9, 10 and Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23. He argued that the SRA punished anew the prior behavior because use of juvenile convictions to determine adult sentences was mandatory under the SRA but discretionary under pre-SRA law. The court disagreed and affirmed the sentence. Defendant was punished only for conduct occurring after the SRA's effective date; therefore, the SRA did not change the legal consequences of his prior juvenile offenses. The SRA was not retrospective as applied, and there was no ex post facto violation. Defendant was sentenced according to the law in effect at the time of his post-SRA adult crime. The SRA did not impose a more severe penalty for the prior conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had claimed that the information failed to state a crime, or in the alternative, that the crime stated was contrary to Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17 because &sect; 20.01.460(2)(d) provided a criminal sanction for a civil debt. Section 20.01.460(2)(d) stated that a person who intentionally failed to pay for agricultural products valued at more than $ 250 would be guilty of a class C felony. The trial court found that &sect; 20.01.460(2)(d) was unconstitutional on its face and dismissed the charges against defendant. In affirming the judgment, the court concluded that &sect; 20.01.460(2)(d) violated the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt. Specifically, the court held that &sect; 20.01.460(2)(d) could not be construed to require a showing of fraudulent intent as an element of the crime defined in the statute because the word &quot;intentional&quot; could not be construed according to its plain meaning to mean &quot;fraudulent intent.&quot; Under modern procedural due process rights, such judicial construction was precluded. The court stated that to attempt such a construction would be to read into the statute an element, which was not there.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A contractor hired defendant to work on painting the victim's house.

Defendant took the victim's money and rings. After defendant initially disconnected the victim's telephone, he reconnected it after the victim expressed concern because of her heart condition that she would be unable to contact her doctor. The court held that: (1) the trial court findings were supported by competent evidence and justified entry of an exceptional sentence where the trial court complied with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(3) and set forth its reasons for the exceptional sentence; and (2) the judgment and sentence on the assault charge had to be vacated without a remand for resentencing because the assault merged into the robbery, the sentences were concurrent, and the aggravating factors were sufficient to sustain the exceptional sentence on the robbery charge.</SPAN></P>

The cyclist sued the city for his personal injuries and claimed that the city negligently designed and operated the trail by failing to provide adequate signs and traffic control for multiple vehicular and pedestrian uses. The trial court granted summary judgment to the city based on Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 4.24.200 and 4.24.210, recreational use statutes that limited the city's liability. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) the statute provided immunity to successors in interest to the land who continued to open up the land for recreational purposes; (2) the statute could not be in contravention of public policy because the statute became public policy once enacted, unless found unconstitutional; (3) the city's failure to post signs on the trail was not the proximate cause of the cyclist's injuries because he had ridden the trail before, knew of the possibility of joggers, and had aborted an earlier attempt to pass another cyclist because a jogger was in the way; and (4) the statute did not violate any equal protection rights because it applied equally to everyone entering the area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developers bought acres of land and proposed to build a condominium complex. On this project, the city engineer conditioned issuance of building permits on the payment of a per unit fee. These fees were to finance general park development and improvement, and Poulsbo, Wash. Ordinance 79-14 was cited as authority to impose the fees. The developers did not appeal the fees to the city counsel. After payment, the developer brought an action in the trial court for reimbursement of the fees, and the trial court dismissed the claim for the park fees on the basis that there had been no exhaustion of an administrative remedy: appeal to the city council. The developers appealed to the court. Generally, where fees were imposed per the State Environmental Protection Act, an appeal to the city council was available. The court ruled that the case came within the exhaustion exception that applied when the constitutionality of the law sought to be enforced was at issue. The court found that the city enforced an unconstitutional ordinance, Ordinance 79-14. Ordinance 79-14 did not evidence a specific environmental policy of the city on which to condition the issuance of permits.</SPAN></P>

The first garage destroyed by fire was at the home where defendant was placed as a foster child. The second garage to burn was located approximately two blocks from the foster home. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.48.020, the arson statute. He asserted that it was unconstitutionally vague both facially and as applied to him. The court concluded that &sect; 9A.48.020 was facially constitutional because it provided both adequate notice of the conduct it proscribes and adequate standards to prevent arbitrary and &quot;ad hoc&quot; enforcement. Also, the court easily found that the statute was constitutional as applied to defendant. The court noted the trial court's finding that defendant knowingly caused fires manifestly dangerous to human life, which was plainly within the core of the statute. Defendant also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for the second fire.

The aggravated first degree murder statute was constitutional as applied. It required evidence of premeditation and of a statutory aggravating factor that differentiated it from first degree murder. The aggravating factor in defendant's situation was rape. There was direct evidence and evidence from which the jury could infer premeditation. The trial court properly allowed the State's objections to the five jurors who made it unmistakably clear that they would automatically vote against the death penalty or those whose attitudes toward the death penalty would prevent their making an impartial decision as to guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of the judgments of conviction and the sentences imposed by the Superior Court for Snohomish County, Washington for bookmaking on the ground that Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.46.220, 9.46.020(4) under which they were charged were unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to their convictions and sentences for bookmaking, defendants assigned error to the trial court's denial of their pretrial motion to dismiss and the imposition of judgment and sentence. On appeal, defendants contended that Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.46.220, 9.46.020(4) were void for vagueness. The court held that the test for vagueness consisted of a determination of whether a person of common intelligence must necessarily guess at the statutes meaning and differ as to its application. The court considered the two components of adequate notice to citizens and adequate standards to prevent arbitrary enforcement to determine whether the words &quot;as a business&quot; and &quot;in a casual fashion&quot; in the definition of bookmaking gave the average person notice of the proscribed conduct. The court held that common intelligence and general knowledge provided an understanding that an activity conducted as a business was a systematic, for profit, regularly engaged in activity as opposed to an irregular, occasional activity. Therefore, the court ruled that the statutory definition of bookmaking in the gambling act was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All three defendants were charged with second degree theft, a violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.56.040, arising out of the failure to return rented video equipment. Two defendants sought, and obtained, dismissals of the second degree theft charges against them. The third defendant was convicted of second degree theft. On appeal by the State and by the third defendant, the court reversed the dismissal of the second degree theft charges and affirmed the third defendant's conviction for second degree theft. The court held that theft in the second degree, a general statute, and criminal possession of leased or rented equipment, a special statute, were not concurrent, which did not prohibit being charged under the general statute. The court further held that defendants could not challenge on the basis of equal protection because they had not yet been convicted and had no standing to protest the legislation. The court further held that even though defendants had lawfully obtained the video equipment, they were sufficiently on notice that to fail to return it amounted to second degree theft because there was no vagueness in the statute as to what exerting unauthorized control meant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for first degree kidnapping and rape while armed with a deadly weapon. On appeal, defendant argued that the superior court unconstitutionally commented on the evidence and erred by refusing to give instructions on unlawful imprisonment and diminished capacity. The court affirmed the conviction. The court observed that the jury was instructed on second as well as first degree rape. That defendant was convicted of first degree rape made it even more clear that the jury rejected the diminished capacity defense. The superior court's failure to instruct on unlawful imprisonment was therefore harmless error. The court also found that the superior court's remarks did not constitute an unconstitutional comment on the evidence. The court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the superior court's remarks did not change the outcome in any event. The court remanded for resentencing on the first degree rape charge, holding that defendant's use of a firearm could be used to enhance his sentence, even where the use of a deadly weapon was an element of the crime charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the City of Seattle and its police chief, sought review of a decision of the Superior Court for King County (Washington), which granted respondent citizens' petition for declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the City from setting up drunk driving checkpoints.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City developed a plan to conduct a series of drunk driving checkpoints. The sites were selected based on prior arrests and accidents. The police were to stop each car approaching the checkpoint, identify themselves, inform the driver of the purpose for the checkpoint, and ask to see the driver's license. If an officer observed evidence of drunkenness, he or she would advise the driver to pull over for field sobriety tests. Drivers who did not appear intoxicated were to be permitted to proceed. The citizens successfully filed a petition for declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the City from setting up the checkpoints. On appeal, the court reversed and granted judgment in favor of the City. The court held that the City's plan did not violate the Fourth Amendment or Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7. When operated under its strict limitations and its carefully crafted regulations approved by high-level administrators, the City's program eliminated any fear of unfettered discretion on the part of the police. Moreover, the City made a strong showing of the effectiveness of the program and the necessity for its use, which justified the slight intrusion on a motorist's privacy.</SPAN></P>

The superior court calculated defendant's offender score by including an Illinois prior conviction. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, but remanded the action for resentencing. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.360 of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 provided that out-of-state convictions were covered by the offense definitions and sentences that were provided by Washington law. The court construed the Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.360 of the Act to not allow a defendant who committed a violent felony out of state to avoid the imposition of a greater sentence because the other state imposed a shorter prison term. The superior court was also allowed to look to the evidence and the presentence report information when it determined the grade of the offense. The superior court improperly sentenced defendant because the attempted murder and the robbery were encompassed within the same criminal conduct and they should have been counted as one crime in computing defendant's criminal history pursuant to Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The successors' deed contained a condition subsequent reserving their right to construct a boathouse on property that had been granted to the city. But the city refused to allow the construction of the boathouse, so the successors filed a suit to recover damages against the city. The trial court entered a judgment for the successors but denied their right to reenter the land and denied their motion for attorney fees. On appeal, the court rejected the city's claim that the condition subsequent had lapsed. The court held that the condition subsequent was still effective and that the successors still had the right to construct the boathouse. The court further rejected the city's impossibility defense because the event, which the city relied on to escape performance, was foreseeable at the time of the execution of the deed. The court also held that the city's refusal to allow the construction of the boathouse was an unconstitutional taking, but the court held that the trial court erroneously reduced the amount of the successors' award.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board passed a stock restriction ordinance, which resulted in the losing of a previously open range due to its reclassification as a stock restricted area. The affected property owners sought a writ of certiorari for review of the board's action. The trial court issued the writ of certiorari and upon review, granted summary judgment to the property owners, holding that the newly enacted stock restriction ordinance was void. The county and the board appealed, claiming that the board's action was not reviewable. The court reversed and ruled that the board's action was not reviewable by statutory writ of certiorari because the board's action was purely legislative in nature and not quasi judicial. Finally, although the court had the inherent authority to review the board's action to determine if its findings were arbitrary and capricious as a matter of law, the board's failure to make formal findings of fact and conclusions of law did not support a finding that the board acted arbitrarily and capriciously in passing the ordinance because such procedural safeguards requiring written findings to ensure fairness in quasi-judicial hearings did not apply to legislative actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed, contending that the juvenile defendants did not meet their burden of showing that Seattle, Wash., Municipal Code &sect; 12A.14.080 was unconstitutional. On review, the court agreed and reversed. The State of Washington preempted local jurisdictions from grading and punishing serious offenses, i.e., felonies. However the doctrine of preemption did not apply because there was no state law grading, as a felony, any offense with elements similar to &sect; 12A.14.080. The court could find no statute or case which indicated an intent to preempt the city from defining misdemeanor offenses which could be committed with chako sticks. There was no state statute which expressly permitted possession of chako sticks.  Wash. Rev.

The city appealed from the decision. The court reversed the decision finding that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague on its face.

The subcontractor instituted an action against the department, claiming it was entitled to a price adjustment on both projects pursuant to a provision in the prime contract. The department contended that the contractor's releases barred both all claims, and that both the 180-day contract limitation and &sect; 47.28.120 barred the claim as to one project.

The court ruled that the contract limitations period was valid and enforceable because parties could contract for a shorter limitations period than that called for in a general statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certain structures on the owner's contiguous lots were valid non-conforming uses. The owner later decided to develop his remaining contiguous vacant lots. The city issued a permit, conditioned on the abatement of the nonconforming uses. LMC 20.14.040(c)(2) provided that a lawful nonconforming use had to be rectified when major alterations were permitted on a nonconforming &quot;site.&quot; The city claimed that a &quot;site&quot; could include a contiguous lot under one owner. The owner argued that LMC 20.14.040 defined a &quot;site&quot; as a lot or contiguous lots, which were under one owner and had established mutual access, circulation, and shared parking facilities. A hearing examiner upheld the city's interpretation. The trial court reversed, concluding that the city's interpretation was unconstitutional and adopting the owner's interpretation of the ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the owner's interpretation was a proper statement of the legislative body's intent. Also, the city's interpretation did not satisfy the minimum scrutiny test and resulted in a violation of the owner's right to equal protection. The owner's interpretation, however, created no constitutional infirmity.</SPAN></P>

The pre-termination hearing was a limited hearing sufficient for a determination of whether reasonable grounds existed to support the discharge of the police officer. The police officer had a property interest in his continued employment, and he was subject to discharge only for cause. The court determined that he was wrongfully discharged without the required pre-termination hearing. However, the evidence indicated that his discharge was justified by the police officer's conduct in possessing and using marijuana. The court reversed and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the probable effect of the denial of the pre-termination hearing. If the pre-termination hearing would have prevented his ultimate discharge, the police officer was entitled to reinstatement with back pay and benefits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After respondent Department of Ecology (DOE) issued an order declaring that appellant corporation's right to use public waters pursuant to a certificate had reverted to the State of Washington, the Pollution Control Hearings Board (PCHB) and the Superior Court for Okanogan County, Washington, affirmed the DOE's order. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that its due process rights had been violated. The court stated that with the enactment of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.21B, the legislature prohibited the DOE from conducting any hearings, thus repealing sub silentio the show cause procedure previously provided for in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.14.130. Since the PCHB was only given the power to hear appeals from DOE's orders, the legislature had failed to provide any due process prior to a termination order by the DOE. Property owners had a vested interest in their water rights, and those rights were entitled to due process protection. Accordingly, the portion of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.21B.120 that prohibited the DOE from conducting hearings as to the issuance, modification, or termination of any permit or license was unconstitutional, and the termination of the corporation's vested property right prior to notice and hearing violated due process. The court rejected the DOE's argument that the relinquishment order was not final. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.21B.120, any order issued by the DOE became final unless it was appealed within 30 days. Furthermore, the language of the order specifically terminated the water rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision. It remanded the case for a hearing before the DOE and for a determination of attorney fees for the corporation both at trial and on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The court found that the officers enjoyed a qualified immunity against liability for their action. The court determined that the officers had a right to believe they could operate as they did because the applicable statutes conferred broad authority under the circumstances. The court also determined that, under the circumstances, the officers did not act unreasonably in serving the warrant at approximately 6:20 p.m., especially when two of the customers arrested immediately before the warrant was served had entered the pharmacy after posted business hours.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When he killed his wife, defendant was on a weekend pass from a psychiatric hospital where he had voluntarily admitted himself for treatment of alcohol dependency and paranoia. The court affirmed the judgment convicting him of murder. The court held that &sect; 9A.12.010 was not overbroad because it did not require defendant to plead that he believed he was following an order from God and invocation of the insanity defense was not conditioned on any activity or belief that was covered by the First Amendment. If the trial court erred in allowing three references by the prosecutor to defendant's post-Miranda silence, the error was constitutionally harmless because overwhelming, untainted evidence supported the jury's verdict. An officer's testimony that defendant's wife had described a prior threat he made against her was properly admitted as an excited utterance. The trial court's evidentiary rulings on statements made by defendant during a family therapy session and to expert witnesses who were evaluating his mental condition were proper, and there was no prosecutorial misconduct sufficiently serious to affect the fairness of the trial and warrant reversal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sought review of the judgment from the Superior Court, King County (Washington), which found in favor of appellee accident victims, husband and wife. The accident victims claimed that the county was negligent in maintaining its roads. The county argued that the lower court erred in not imputing the husband's negligence to reduce the accident victims' recovery, and that the statute imputing contributory fault was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A husband and wife and their daughter were injured in an accident on a county road. The wife was most seriously injured and sustained permanent damage to one hip. The husband and wife brought an action in negligence against the county. The lower court found that the husband was 80 per cent negligent and awarded damages under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.22.020. The lower court reduced the husband's award by 80 per cent. The county sought review and claimed that the lower court erred by not imputing the husband's negligence to reduce the wife's recovery for lost earnings, medical expenses, and the value of the family automobile. The county also claimed that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated certain provisions of the state constitution. On review, the court found that the intent of the statute was to prevent the enrichment of a tortfeasor spouse while allowing the innocent spouse recovery. The court held that the wife's recovery would be her separate property damages plus a one-half interest in the community property damages. The husband's half interest would be diminished by his own contributory fault, and the wife would recover the full extent of her medical expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statute challenged by the county was valid, and that the husband's fault should not generally reduce the wife's recovery. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court except as to recovery for the wife's lost wages, which was modified by reducing one-half of the recovery by the amount of the husband's comparative negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner filed a personal restraint petition (PRP) alleging that his due process rights had been violated because the Washington Department of Corrections refused to recommend him for parole because of his refusal to participate in its preparatory Mutual Agreement Program (MAP), even though he was beyond his good time release date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted of the first-degree murder of his father-in-law. The jury recommended the death penalty, but the State was precluded from imposing death under the then-existing statute. He received a life sentence. After serving 20 years, less earned good time, he was eligible for parole. But because he had refused to participate in the MAP, which was similar to a rehabilitation plan, he was not recommended for parole. He filed suit against the Department of Corrections in federal district court, alleging that the policy requiring MAP participation violated due process and equal protection. The federal court found that he had no constitutionally protected liberty interest in being paroled and that the MAP policy for life-term prisoners was rationally related to a legitimate State objective so equal protection was not violated. He then filed his PRP. The court dismissed his petition, finding relief was precluded because there was no constitutional error. There was no due process right to the prospect of parole. The parole board had not violated due process by failing to set a minimum term. Fixing of a tentative parole release date was discretionary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner's personal restraint petition was denied and dismissed. The court held that determination of his eligibility for parole did not invoke due process protections, and there was no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a decision by the Superior Court for Stevens County, Washington, which dismissed criminal charges against defendant, who was a juvenile. The superior court determined that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.070(7), which gave the State discretion in certain defined instances to either file a charge or divert a juvenile's case to a community program, violated the doctrines of separation of powers, due process, and equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an incident in which defendant stole a car, the prosecutor had discretion under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.070 either to charge defendant with taking a motor vehicle without permission or to divert the case. After the prosecutor elected to charge, the superior court granted defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground that the grant of the prosecutor's discretion under &sect; 13.40.070(7) violated the doctrines of separation of powers, due process, and equal protection. The court reversed the superior court's ruling and found that &sect; 13.40.070(7) did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers because it provided sufficient standards to guide the prosecutor, and the prosecutor's decision was subject to judicial review. The standards in &sect; 13.40.070(7) protected against unfair and arbitrary decisions by the prosecutor. In its ruling, the court found that the statute did not violate due process because the prosecutor's charging function under &sect; 13.40.070(3), (5)-(7) did not alter the prosecutor's traditional discretion in making the charging decision. Moreover, the failure to prosecute all other possible violators was not contrary to the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court reversed. The court found that the ex-police officer was entitled to a hearing under county regulations where the ex-police officer had completed his six-months' probationary period the day before he was terminated. The court held that even though the ex-police officer did not work a full day on his first day of work that day was to be calculated for purposes of computing the passage of time. The court determined that Wash. Super. Ct. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestee sold marijuana to the undercover deputy in the arrestee's vehicle. The vehicle was seized under &sect; 69.50.505 after an arrest. The arrestee was served with proper notice of the seizure. A hearing was held under &sect; 69.50.505(e), and an order of forfeiture was entered. The conversion action commenced and the superior court's decision entered upon the review of a district court's decision was found not appealable under Wash. R. App. P. 2.2(c). The court of appeals treated the notice of appeal as a motion for discretionary review, which was granted under Wash. R. App. P. 2.3(d)(2), (3). Because the seizure occurred without a warrant, it was allegedly unconstitutional. In interpreting a similar statute that allowed warrantless seizures, 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 881(b)(4), most courts concluded that the U.S. Const. amend. IV did not require a warrant; thus, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.505 did not offend the Fourth Amendment. The arrestee also contended that because the vehicle was illegally seized, it could not be forfeited. The exclusionary rule did apply to a forfeiture, however even if the seizure had been illegal, there was sufficient untainted evidence to support the forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was injured while working as a referee at a basketball game, and he filed a claim with the DLI. He testified that he did not list the amount of his wages because he did not know what figure to use. He later told an employee of the DLI that his main source of income was a home construction business and that he was working in that business when he was injured. She put his income for that business on the claim form. After receiving benefits, defendant was interviewed by a DLI investigator who wanted to verify his work and wages. Defendant gave him information about construction work he had done. One of the customers that he mentioned denied that defendant did any work for him. Defendant claimed that the customer paid cash for the job because he had financed the project from winnings he had made that he had not declared on his taxes. Defendant contended that it was reversible error for the charging information not to use the statutory language and specify the allegedly false information.

Code &sect; 9A.44.120, as statements of an &quot;unavailable&quot; child witness. Defendant contended that &sect; 9A.44.120, which permitted hearsay statements of children under 10 years of age to be admitted into evidence in certain cases, was unconstitutional as a violation of the confrontation clauses of the Washington and United States Constitutions. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the statements into evidence. At the time defendant's statements were offered into evidence, the trial court had already received evidence of the child's statements without objection. Therefore, the trial court had before it independent evidence that established prima facie proof of the corpus delicti of indecent liberties.

Defendant was not sentenced differently from a codefendant because of a different criminal history, but rather because defendant was charged with a different crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, various dairy operators, challenged the judgment of the Superior Court for Whatcom County (Washington), which granted a summary judgment dismissing the operators' claims against respondents, the state, a director, and state veterinarians. The operators had filed an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and for negligence, abuse of police powers, and unconstitutional &quot;taking&quot; in connection with the slaughter of their cattle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state entered into a cooperative brucellosis control and eradication program involving the testing and slaughtering of cattle and calf vaccinations. It became brucellosis-free, and the USDA discontinued vaccination subsidization. Later, brucellosis cases reemerged, and the director issued an emergency order requiring the testing of imported cattle and slaughtering, including herd depopulation, which required the approval of the state veterinarians and the USDA, of reactor cattle. The operators' herds became infected. They filed an action against the state, director, and veterinarians under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and for negligence, abuse of police powers, and unconstitutional taking. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's dismissal order in part, affirmed in part, and held that: (1) the three-year statute of limitations under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.080(2) applied to the negligence claims; (2) some of the operators' claims were barred because they were filed more than three years after discovering a reactor cow; and (3) some of the operators could maintain a negligence claim against the state because the special relationship exception to the public duty doctrine applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the superior court's grant of a summary judgment and dismissal of the negligence claims as to some of the operators and remanded the action to the superior court for further proceedings. The court affirmed the superior court's grant of a summary judgment dismissing the abuse of police powers and unconstitutional &quot;taking&quot; claims against the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer observed defendant proceed through a steady red traffic control light. He stopped her vehicle and asked for her driver's license six times. She refused to respond and was arrested. She contended that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.021 and the municipal code under which she was charged were unconstitutional as applied to her because they improperly restricted her right to travel on the public highways. She alleged that she had a right, rather than privilege, to operate a motor vehicle on public highways and streets. The court upheld the conviction. &quot;Privilege&quot; meant a qualified right or a particular advantage enjoyed by a class, beyond the common advantages of other citizens. A &quot;right&quot; connoted an interest belonging to every person. Driving an automobile was a privilege because the activity was limited to a class of individuals who had passed a driver's license examination. The privilege of driving was always subject to reasonable regulation and control under the police power in the interest of public safety and welfare. Licensing was a means by which the state was allowed to determine whether vehicle operators had acquired a minimal standard of competence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants, a male and female college student, appealed from orders of the Superior Court for Whitman County (Washington), which convicted them of delivery and possession of cocaine. Defendants contended that the trial court erred when it denied their motion to suppress evidence seized from the female student's dorm room because the search of her room by undercover police officers violated her Fourth Amendment privacy rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The female student invited an undercover officer to come to her dorm room the next day to buy cocaine. When the officer did so, the female student was not there, but the male student sold him cocaine. As the officer was arresting him, the female student arrived and was arrested. After obtaining a search warrant, the police found other drugs. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions because defendants had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the room, the warrantless arrests were authorized by statute, and the entry of the police into the room was consensual. The court held that when the female student invited officers to her dorm room to conduct illegal business, she gave up any reasonable expectation that what transpired there would be private. Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 504-24-020, which required visitors to dormitories to have an escort, provided no protection for the illegal business. Pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.31.100, no warrant was necessary for the arrests because the drug sale was committed in the officer's presence. Because the officer heard the female student advise another guest to admit the officer to the room to make the buy, the entry was consensual.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Superior Court for Franklin County, Washington, judgment of conviction of two counts of indecent liberties with a five-year-old boy and resulting sentences, which were outside of the standard range. He claimed the trial court erred: (1) in finding the victim competent to testify and admitting his hearsay statements concerning the incidents; and (2) in imposing the exceptional sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant met the boy at a swimming pool. The first incident occurred when he accompanied the boy to the restroom. On the second occasion, he and the victim showered together after swimming. In a bench trial, the trial court determined the boy was competent to testify and the boy related the circumstances surrounding the two sexual contacts. The prosecution then presented a transcript of the boy's statement to police and a police officer's testimony without defense objection. The defense opposed the prosecution's motion for exceptional sentences after the guilty verdict, claiming there were no aggravating factors. The trial court found no mitigating factors and cited as aggravating factors the boy's age, the multiple incidents, the position of trust, and the fact that the presumptive sentence was too lenient. The court, affirming the conviction, held that the issue of the boy's out-of-court statements had not been preserved for appeal. But it reversed the sentences. The victim's age was an element of the crime itself. The trust relationship was relatively minor. The record supported the trial court's reasoning but the reasons did not justify the sentences imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed. The exceptional sentences were reversed, and the case was remanded for sentencing within the standard range.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had previous first degree forgery convictions that were dismissed after he completed probation. He also had two prior convictions for delivery of a controlled substance for which he was paroled. In calculating his criminal history, the sentencing court struck the two forgeries, included the two previous delivery convictions, and ordered his sentence of 34 months to run consecutively to the previous delivery offenses. Defendant contended that it was error to order the consecutive service because the previous sentences were entered prior to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA). He argued that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.400(2), (3), as applied by the sentencing court, treated differently those convicted under pre-SRA statutes and those convicted under the post-SRA sentencing scheme because a post-SRA defendant had no unexpired terms to serve. The court upheld the sentence. Not all post-SRA defendants served full terms prior to reentering society, and a defendant who committed an offense in jail or who escaped was similarly treated. A paroled felon was &quot;under sentence of felony&quot; for the purposes of the statute requiring consecutive sentences, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92.080(1).</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's ownership alone was not enough to establish a reasonable and legitimate expectation of privacy and that ownership was relevant to the inquiry, but that the total circumstances determined whether the one challenging the search had a reasonable and legitimate expectation of privacy in the locus of the search.</SPAN></P>

The issue on appeal was whether the one-year limitation of actions period prevailed over a statutory period of limitations on contracts even though the insurer claimed no prejudice. The court affirmed the summary judgment against the insureds. The court concluded that the unambiguous contract provision that limited the right of action under the insurance contract did not frustrate the reasonable expectation of the insureds and the purpose of the contract. The court also concluded that the one-year contract limitation was not precluded by the six-year general statute of limitations for written contracts. The court found that the insured's claims of equal protection and privileges and immunities violations failed because there was no state action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers stopped a vehicle in which defendant was a passenger. The vehicle was in an area with a high incidence of burglaries. It was stopped for a defective license plate lamp. During the stop, officers learned that defendant and the driver each wore a knife. Other items were seen, which the officers thought were burglary tools. The officers became suspicious. The co-defendant was arrested for not having a valid driver's license. During his pat down for weapons, several pieces of stolen jewelry were found. A warrant was obtained to search the car. The search produced two safes from a local club and what appeared to be burglary tools. Given the late hour, the crime rate, lack of identification, the knives, and the tools, defendant was arrested for possession of burglary tools. He argued that the initial search and seizure was unconstitutional because there was no articulable suspicion that he was involved in criminal activity or that he was armed and dangerous. The court affirmed. The facts justified questioning him and performing a quick check of the vehicle for weapons. The Terry stop and frisk led to discovery of the tools and ripened into probable cause to arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A portion of the dairy farmer's property was acquired by the State in an eminent domain action. That action was settled, and the farmer subsequently relocated his herd to new property and sought compensation under the relocation assistance act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 8.26. Some compensation was awarded, but the dairy farmer appealed the denial of certain claims. The court affirmed in all respects. The claim for lost milk production was based on stress to the cows caused by the move. The court held that this claim was not compensable because it was actually a claim for lost profits, not a loss of personal property. The claim for the loss of a cow killed in transit was not compensable under Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 365-24-420 because, although insurance was available, the dairy farmer elected to move the cattle without obtaining insurance, even though the cost of the insurance premium would have been compensable. The claim that the dairy farmer incurred an excessive culling rate after the move was also denied because it was not supported by the evidence. The dairy farmer's own testimony indicated that a 20 to 25 percent cull rate was normal, but his rate was actually below that rate.</SPAN></P>

His sole contention was that the statute upon which the department relied, former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.308(3), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant, a state resident and licensed driver, was arrested for driving while intoxicated. Because he refused to submit to a breathalyzer test, the department suspended his driver's license for six months. The trial court affirmed that decision. He appealed, arguing that the statute unfairly prescribed greater punishment for resident licensed drivers than for resident unlicensed drivers. On review, the court held that the law created three classes of offenders: (1) resident, licensed drivers; (2) nonresident drivers possessing a nonresident operating privilege; and (3) resident, unlicensed drivers. The first step in an equal protection analysis was is to identify the proper standard for reviewing the legislative classification. It found both strict scrutiny and heightened scrutiny were inappropriate tests, so it used minimal scrutiny. The classification scheme effectively denied the legal right to drive to anyone who refused to submit to a breathalyzer test. It deprived each group of driving privileges for six months. In affirming, the court held that the classification was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Within two months of being released from jail, defendant again committed the crime of taking a motor vehicle without owner's permission. Within a short time of his release from prison on parole, he was charged a third time with taking a motor vehicle without owner's permission. He was then charged as a habitual criminal and convicted. The trial judge sentenced defendant to life under the habitual criminal act, but suspended the sentence for 20 years on certain conditions. The court affirmed, rejecting defendant's argument that he did not have sufficient time to reform between convictions. Defendant had an opportunity for reform. The court found that only if the act leading to the habitual criminal charge was committed simultaneously with or prior to the previous convictions, could it be concluded that there was no opportunity for reform. The court also found that the suspension of the life sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.

The court held that the instruction was vague and therefore reversed the judgment. The court noted that the problem with the instruction was that determination of whether there was an &quot;unlawful act&quot; required the court to speculate and conjecture as to which act of defendant might have been characterized by the jury as unlawful. The court held that the denial of the self-defense theory where the conduct of defendant could be deemed accidental was not rational, reasonable, or fair. Under the instruction given, if the jury were to find the collision accidental, they could have determined that the act constituted reckless or negligent driving. They might also have concluded that this was an unlawful act which provoked the incident leading to the stabbing. According to the instruction, they would have been precluded from considering the claim of self-defense. The aggressor instruction here effectively vitiated any claim of self-defense to be considered by the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the State offered evidence of two incidents of sexual abuse. The first incident, on July 2, 1983, was presented through physical evidence observed by witnesses and through the child's relatives. The second incident, on July 21, 1983, was demonstrated by means of the child's hearsay statements, other physical evidence, and the child's conduct. Although, defendant did not raise the issue of jury unanimity at trial, he alleged on appeal that this requirement was not satisfied in his case and that the error was one of constitutional magnitude, which could be raised for the first time on appeal. The court reversed, holding that the incidents of July 2nd and July 21st were connected by the victim. However, the court found this connection was not enough to find that the acts formed one continuing offense or a single transaction. The court noted the State made no election as to which criminal act upon which it would rely for conviction and the trial judge gave no unanimity charge. The court held the error was not harmless where a rational trier of fact could have had a reasonable doubt as to whether an act of sexual intercourse was established with respect to the July 2 incident.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment to the city, ruling that it was not liable when its officer enforced a State statute that had not been ruled unconstitutional. The trial court denied the driver injunctive relief and dismissed his civil rights claim. The court held that the pleadings were insufficient to give the city and the trial court notice of the type of injunctive relief requested. The driver's complaint did not contain a demand for judgment for injunctive relief. Summary judgment dismissing the driver's civil rights claims was proper. The city police captain sent a memo to his officers requesting them to postpone enforcing Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.435. Later, he approved enforcement of &sect; 46.20.435.

On appeal, the court held that the trial court based its sentence on the belief that the standard range did not provide enough punishment to defendant or enough protection to society. The court found that the standard range already reflected an offender's criminal history. The court ruled that the range expressed the legislative judgment as to the length of sentence appropriate to fulfill the purpose of protecting the public. Further, the court noted that the legislature's true intent was to include one offense in criminal history when prior concurrent sentences were judicially imposed for more than one offense regardless of whether the concurrent sentences arose out of the same or separate incidents.

Rev. Code &sect; 9.95.115. The prisoner challenged the parole board's determination that his minimum mandatory sentence was not credited with time served. The court granted the petition, holding that: (1) the intermediate scrutiny test was appropriate because a conditional liberty interest was implicated by the restart statute and (2) the 20-year continuous confinement requirement of the restart statute violated equal protection because the state interest in &sect; 9.95.115, which was to assure that those convicted of serious crimes were rehabilitated before returning to society, was not furthered by the statute and did not justify the differential treatment of those serving minimum mandatory sentences on life sentences and all other prisoners serving minimum mandatory sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the prisoner's petition and remanded the case to the parole board for a redetermination of the prisoner's mandatory minimum term giving credit for the time the prisoner served before his escape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a deputy sheriff and his wife, appealed the order of the Superior Court for Whatcom County (Washington), which awarded summary judgment to defendants, the sheriff and the county, in the deputy's action for wrongful discharge and violations of his right to due process under the United States and Washington Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county sheriff's department learned that the deputy was being investigated for possible sexual abuse of his stepdaughter. A detective interviewed the daughter and filed a report. The detective interviewed the deputy, who allegedly admitted his guilt and offered to make a deal. The sheriff met with the deputy and asked him to resign. The sheriff discharged the deputy in writing for violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.14.110 and Whatcom County, Wash., Civ. Serv. Comm'n R. 9. The deputy was acquitted on criminal charges and demanded reinstatement. The sheriff and the county refused. The deputy brought suit. The superior court awarded summary judgment to the sheriff and the county. The deputy appealed. The court affirmed. The deputy's failure to appeal his dismissal to the county civil service commission within 10 days and to seek judicial review within 30 days of rejection barred judicial review under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.14.120. The deputy's constitutional challenge had not been made in his complaint; rather, he had merely alleged that the discharge was unlawful and that he was entitled to reinstatement. Therefore, the commission had jurisdiction over the deputy's complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord refused to rent a room in her home to a black man because of his race. Three and a half years after he filed a complaint, the Commission found that the landlord violated the man's civil rights, awarded him damages for emotional harm and inconvenience, and ordered the landlord to notify a housing organization if she advertised a room for rent in the future. The trial court affirmed except for the award of damages and the notification requirement. The court upheld the affirmance of the Commission's decision, holding that the decision was not barred by laches; that the term &quot;real estate transaction&quot; in Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 49.60.040 (1977) was not unconstitutionally vague; and that by opening her home to the public for the rental of rooms, the landlord voluntarily subordinated her privacy rights to the compelling state interest in eradicating racial discrimination. Holding that the Commission had the authority under Wash. Rev.

The court found that the jury did not believe that defendant's borderline conduct of taking back the engagement ring, especially where he unlawfully remained in the house armed with a deadly weapon. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in excusing a juror who was not unequivocally opposed to the death penalty, finding that the trial court properly determined that the juror would not impose the death penalty despite the evidence presented.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had over 20 violations before he was accorded the status of an habitual traffic offender. When stopped by a state trooper for a moving violation and asked to produce his driver's license, defendant indicated it had been revoked pursuant to the Act. Defendant contended that his equal protection rights were violated because Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 46.20.342, 46.20.416 proscribed different penalties for the same conduct prohibited by &sect; 46.65.090. The difference occurred in the penalty that was imposed on a second conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that a violation of &sect; 46.65.090 was the proper charge under the circumstances. Section 46.65.090 was a special statute that contained the same elements as the general statutes prohibiting driving while one's license was revoked, plus the element that defendant have been found a habitual offender. Since the prosecutor would not have discretion to charge under the presumed facts of defendant's case, there was no denial of equal protection. However, the court did not reach that issue because &sect; 46.65.090 was the only statute applicable to defendant.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the conspirator's conviction and sentence but reversed the co-conspirator's conviction. The court held that the information supporting the issuance of the search warrant was not stale and that the search did not exceed the limits of the warrant because of the plain view doctrine. However, the court held that the extrajudicial statements of the nontestifying conspirator were outside the ambit of admissible hearsay because they were not in furtherance of the conspiracy.

The police took the children from the home. The parents argued the tort of outrage, wrongful infliction of emotional distress, civil rights violations, defamation, custodial interference, and false imprisonment. The court held that the conduct was not sufficiently outrageous and extreme to result in liability. The parents failed to demonstrate mental or emotional distress. The state was not a person under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. There was no allegation that the city and school district adopted unconstitutional ordinance or policies and the nurse and caseworker were immune because the acted under a good faith reasonable belief that their conduct was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The condemnors brought a condemnation action for a private way of necessity over the condemnees' property. The condemnors were awarded the private way of necessity and ordered to compensate the condemnees for the easement rights granted in the private way of necessity order. The court affirmed the trial court's decision denying the condemnees' request for attorney and expert witness fee awards under &sect; 8.25.070(1). In Washington, attorney fees could only be awarded when authorized by the parties' private agreement, a statute, or a recognized ground of equity. The court determined that &sect; 8.25.070(1) was ambiguous and resorted to statutory construction. The court held that the attorney fee provision applied only to public condemnations. Because the title of the act in question was restrictive in expressly limiting the act's scope to the acquisition of public agencies, if it was interpreted to authorize an attorney fee award in a private condemnation action, the provision would have exceeded the scope of the title and thus been invalid. The general American rule was that the prevailing litigant was not ordinarily entitled to collect an attorney fee from the loser.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of three crimes and his sentence was enhanced for committing them while armed with a firearm and a dangerous weapon. The court affirmed, holding that defendant was not put in double jeopardy by the weapons allegations.

The court stated that neither the deadly weapon enhancement, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.95.040, nor the firearm enhancement, Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant struck a pedestrian with his car, and he was arrested after police entered his apartment and took him to a hospital for a blood sample, without a warrant. Defendant was convicted of felony hit and run under &sect; 46.52.020, and he appealed his conviction alleging that the trial court erred in failing to exclude evidence of his blood alcohol level and failing to dismiss the case due to lack of prima facie evidence of a felony hit and run. The court affirmed, holding that although a confession alone would not sustain a conviction, corroborative evidence was present as two witnesses described the car and the incident, and one witness obtained his license plate number. The state only had to prove a car was involved in an accident in the state, injury or death occurred, and the driver did not remain at the scene. Witness' testimony and evidence of injury established the corpus delicti. Further, the gravity of the offense and the imminent destruction of evidence, in the form of dissipated blood alcohol, created an exigency sufficient to justify the warrantless, nonconsensual entry of defendant's apartment and the immediate taking of a blood sample without obtaining a warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City stipulated that the conduct in question occurred in a theater. The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground that the charging statute, Seattle, Wash. Mun. Code &sect; 12A.10.070, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Section 12A.10.070 stated that it did not apply to artistic or dramatic performances in a theater. On appeal, the court affirmed the preceding court's dismissal and held that &sect; 12A.10.070 was unconstitutionally vague. The court noted that a penal statute was unconstitutionally vague if it did not define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness so that ordinary people could understand what conduct was prohibited and if it was capable of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The court stated that the statute did not define &quot;artistic&quot; and &quot;dramatic.&quot; The court determined that that language of &sect; 12A.10.070 was susceptible to a wide range of interpretations. The court concluded that the ordinance did not provide reasonably clear guidelines for law enforcement officials and triers of fact to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that &sect; 21.20.010 was not vague. The court found that the statute may use general terms such as investment contract, but its provisions were definite enough to give adequate notice of prohibited conduct. The court held that the opinion letter was properly excluded because the attorney was available to testify.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was caught while attempting to elude the police on his motorcycle. Upon defendant's conviction, the court affirmed the judgment and held that defendant was not denied a speedy trial. The speedy trial time started when the complaint was filed in district court. The time in the district court ended when the information was filed in superior court, on the 28th day. Defendant was arraigned within 14 days pursuant to Rule 3.3(c)(2)(ii). The 60-day rule began after his arraignment date less time elapsed in district court. While, technically, defendant's speedy trial time expired one day before he went to trial, Rule 3.3(d)(8) allowed the superior court to have granted a five-day extension because of unavoidable or unforeseen circumstances absent prejudice to defendant. The defense witness was properly excluded because the testimony was not directed toward rebutting the manner in which defendant drove or his attempt to elude the police, but was offered to show motive for his flight. Even if defendant established that his flight was motivated by a fear of physical abuse, he failed to rebut the evidence that he drove with a willful disregard for the life or property of others.</SPAN></P>

According to defendants, the evidence was obtained during an unconstitutional search. Defendants' neighbor informed the sheriff's office that a plant that looked like marijuana was growing on defendants' property. From the neighbor's property line, the deputy sheriff could not see the marijuana. The deputy walked onto defendants' property to confirm that marijuana was growing. The deputy later returned to the marijuana patch and seized one plant. Testing confirmed that it was marijuana. Subsequently, the deputy obtained a search warrant and 235 marijuana plants were seized. The validity of the search warrant was not at issue because the court held that the area where the search and seizure occurred was not constitutionally protected under the U.S. Const. art. IV or the Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court reasoned that the federal constitution did not protect open fields, which included any unoccupied or undeveloped area outside of the curtilage. The state constitution extended no protection because this property was not an area in which one traditionally could reasonably expect privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to revoke his deferred sentence.

He also argued that he was entitled to credit against his prison sentence for all the time spent in the state hospital. The court held that: (1) the evidence supported the trial court's order revoking the deferred sentence; (2) defendant was not punished because of his status as a chronic paranoid schizophrenic but for his criminal behavior; (3) while it was unfortunate that it required over 34 months to determine that defendant was not amenable to treatment, he had no fundamental right to rehabilitative treatment; (4) the treatment conditions of his deferred sentence were reasonable and specifically authorized by Wash.

The employer filed a motion for partial summary judgment with the lower court seeking reversal of the hearing tribunal's damage award. The lower court granted the employer's motion for partial summary judgment overturning the compensation award. Appellants challenged the lower court judgment and argued that the hearing tribunal was entitled to award compensation for humiliation and mental suffering caused by discriminatory practices. The court reversed the order of partial summary judgment and remanded the case for entry of a limited damage award in favor of the former employee. The court held that Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer saw defendant strike a woman. The officer claimed he saw the women rub her cheek and cry, apparently in pain, after the incident. Defendant, however, claimed that he only gave the woman an affectionate tap, that they were in an ongoing relationship, and he had a disability in his hand that would prevent him from hitting the victim in the manner described. Defendant was convicted in police court of using force against another in violation of Pasco, Wash. Mun. Code 9.04.030. The superior court affirmed the conviction. The court reversed. The court held that the city ordinance was preempted by Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9A.04.050, 9A.16.010, 9A.16.050, &amp; 9A.16.090. These statutes reflected the Washington rule that a criminal assault required unlawful force. The ordinance, on the other hand, only required force or violence with the absence of self-defense. The court declined to interpret &quot;force&quot; in the ordinance to mean the same thing as &quot;unlawful force&quot; because the meaning was clear, hence its plain language had to have been given effect. Neither did it matter that defendant's defense was based on how hard he hit the victim and in what context.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A developer acquired an interest in property by entering into a lease with its owner, the State of Washington. The bank loaned the developer a sum to develop one-half of its mobile home park spaces; the loan was secured by a mortgage of the developer's leasehold interest. The funds were used to provide those spaces with water and sewer lines, sidewalks, curbs, and streets. The developer asked the city to assist it by way of an LID assessment to improve the remaining undeveloped spaces. The entire mobile home park would be encompassed within the district. The bank argued that it has a legitimate property interest, as mortgagee, that needed to be protected. The court affirmed the decision of the lower court, holding that only property owners could appeal the LID assessment and that the bank's interest did not constitute property ownership. The court allowed the award of costs under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.44.220, but denied attorney fees because the statute failed to provide explicitly for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held the scope of its judicial review was to determine if the board's conclusions were as a matter of law, arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. The court concluded the board's decision was not arbitrary or capricious as it heard testimony from many neighbors and other citizens. The court further concluded the power to deny licenses was implied from the purpose of King County, Wash., Code &sect;&sect; 11.04, 110.04.10 and thus the decision was not contrary to law. Finally, the court held King County, Wash., Code &sect; 11.04.060(b)(4) did not conflict with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.49.010, which imposed a tax on the owner or keeper of dog kennels. The court held the ordinance and statute were not in conflict as &sect; 36.49.010 did not preclude a county from imposing regulations on dog owners, further a statute was not construed as taking away the power of a municipality to legislate unless that intent was clearly and expressly stated.</SPAN></P>

The city had appealed respondent county boundary review board's denial of the notice of intention, and the trial court had affirmed the review board's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that Wash. Rev. Code ch. 36.93, establishing boundary review boards, was a special law contrary to the Wash. Const. art. 11, &sect; 10, amend. 40. The city also argued that the review board acted beyond its scope of authority under Wash. Rev. Code ch. 36.93, and that the review board's decision was arbitrary and capricious. On appeal, the court held that ch. 36.93 adequately limited the discretion of the review boards and did not exclude natural members of any class. The fact that one review board might grant annexation and another deny it on similar facts did not convert Wash. Rev. Code ch. 36.93 into a special law. Wash. Rev. Code ch. 36.93 was neither a special law under Wash. Const. art. 11, &sect; 10, amend. 40, nor an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power under Wash. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1, amend. 72. The record revealed that the review board heard and considered testimony by many witnesses. It entered its findings and conclusions after considering the statutory criteria. Accordingly, the court held that the boundary review statute was valid and that the review board had not acted arbitrarily and capriciously.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a chief of campus security at a state university, established a practice of donating lost, abandoned, or unclaimed property from the campus lost and found department to charity. The employee was charged with official misconduct and willful neglect of duty. The employee requested that the attorney general, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.01.150, either defend or reimburse him for a defense against criminal charges arising from official acts of state employees. The attorney general declined to do so. The trial court dismissed the charges, and the employee filed a complaint for damages alleging wrongful denial of a defense for the criminal charges. The trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment.

The dismissal of the criminal charges did not include a finding that the employee's conduct &quot;fully&quot; complied with agency guidelines.

The citizen brought an action for his involuntary commitment. The trial court granted summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision, except for the dismissal of the claim against the county under the involuntary commitment law. The court held that the professional was not grossly negligent in failing to investigate the credibility of the daughter's statements, or in detaining him absent any evidence that there was an imminent likelihood that the citizen would harm himself. Further, there was no genuine factual issue of bad faith regarding the applicability of the statutory immunity to the professional and the sergeant, however, the immunity did not apply to the county, and the citizen was entitled to assert his state law tort claim on remand. Their conduct did not constitute the tort of outrage and the citizen had no actionable federal civil rights claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the victim showed defendant that a gun would not fire when loaded, defendant, at the victim's urging, pointed a gun at the victim. The victim brandished a sword at defendant, which caused defendant to involuntarily jerk and shoot the victim. Defendant was convicted of first degree manslaughter as a juvenile. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed the conviction. The court rejected defendant's assertion that the manslaughter statute was void for vagueness, as applied to juveniles, because the statute contained the definite reasonable man standard, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.08.010(1)(c). The superior court correctly applied the reasonable man standard based upon defendant's age. Moreover, the superior court's use of a reasonable juvenile was not subjective for lack of expert testimony concerning defendant's experience and maturity because the objective standard was within the ken of the average court. The superior court had adopted the juvenile's statements as true. Finally, the evidence established the essential elements of first degree manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt because defendant knew the risk of pointing a loaded gun at the victim, but he disregarded that risk.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled that because the officer did not have sufficient probable cause to make the original stop, his testimony regarding defendant's flight would be suppressed. The trial court also found that the passenger was acting as a deputized or at least in a quasi-official capacity and suppressed his testimony. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the chase testimony was admissible in that defendant's reaction to the attempted stop was not reasonable. The police officer and his passenger could testify regarding defendant's actions following the illegal stop. The constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures did not create a constitutional right to react unreasonably to an illegal detention. The police power, therefore, could lawfully extend to prohibiting flight from an unlawful detention where that flight indicated a wanton and wilful disregard for the life and property of others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury, but was granted a new trial. The State claimed that the trial court's post-conviction ruling that a &quot;to convict&quot; instruction did not properly state the law was incorrect. The court agreed. There was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that defendant violated &sect; 46.61.024. On defendant's motion for new trial, the trial court concluded that the part of the instruction that included a wilful failure or refusal to bring the vehicle to a stop did not sufficiently set forth an element of the crime because it did not require that defendant's willful failure to stop occurr while attempting to elude a pursuing police vehicle. The court held that the expression &quot;while attempting to elude a pursuing police vehicle&quot; modified only the element that specified the criminal manner of driving that ensued after the driver's willful failure to stop. The willful failure to stop factually could have occurred while attempting to elude the pursuing vehicle, but as a statutory prerequisite to the commission of the crime, it only had to follow upon the officer's giving of a signal to bring the vehicle to a stop.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that the jury instructions were adequate and did not improperly shift the burden of proving elements of the crime. The court found that because defendant admitted the killing, the only issues before the jury were whether the killing was justified and the degree of murder if it was not justified. Because the instructions, when read as a whole, unambiguously informed the jury of the State's burden to disprove self-defense, it was not reversible error for the &quot;to convict&quot; instruction not to affirmatively place the burden on the State. In addition, the instructions adequately defined &quot;justifiable homicide,&quot; even though the trial court's instruction omitted the element concerning actual resistance of a felony, because the element could be argued under another broader element.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In attempting an armed robbery, defendant had lured the victim into an alley, and the shooter killed him. On appeal, defendant asserted that the evidence did not support the juvenile court's declination order and that it was based on unconstitutional sexual discrimination. The court reviewed the application of the Kent factors to determine whether the juvenile court had properly considered the relevant assertions, evidence, and facts upon its ruling. The underlying robbery was a serious, violent offense, defendant's assertion that she was not a danger to society was contrary to the facts, and her history and sophistication implicated adult situations. The juvenile court had not improperly based its decision on defendant's gender when it took her pregnancy into consideration for rehabilitation purposes. It was not erroneous to admit the accomplice's statements because his refusal to testify rendered him &quot;unavailable&quot; within the meaning of Wash. Evid. R. 804. The felony murder instruction was correct because defendant was an accomplice to murder under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A 32.030(1)(c).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court allowed testimony regarding a statement defendant's minor victim made the day after her alleged assault.

On appeal, the court held that the principal elements of the excited utterance exception were a startling event and a spontaneous declaration caused by that event. The trial court improperly admitted the hearsay declaration under Wash. R. Evid. 803(a)(2). Such a conclusion, however, did not preclude the admission of the evidence under the broader statutory child sexual abuse exception, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.120. Because the trial court admitted the declarations under the strict &quot;excited utterance&quot; exception, it followed that it would also have admitted the declarations under the less strict statutory child sexual abuse exception.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The houseboat owner rented a moorage site from the moorage owner. The moorage owner decided to live on the moorage site. Therefore, he served the houseboat owner with a notice to vacate the premises. The moorage owner commenced the instant unlawful detainer action when the houseboat owner failed to vacate. The trial court entered a judgment for the houseboat owner. On appeal, the moorage owner argued that the houseboat owner could not assert &sect;&sect; 3-4 of Seattle, Washington Ordinance 109280 as affirmative defenses. The court found that city ordinances could be set up as affirmative defenses to unlawful detainer actions, but held that &sect; 3(7) of Seattle, Washington Ordinance 109280, insofar as it required the moorage owner to occupy the moorage site with a personal residence, was unconstitutional and unavailable as an affirmative defense in an unlawful detainer action. However, &sect; 4, which dealt with retaliatory eviction, was constitutional and could be raised as an affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the jury instructions setting out the elements of first degree felony murder and the statutory defense to that crime. They argued that the instructions unconstitutionally shifted to them the burden of disproving elements of the offense. Defendants argued that under the statutory defense, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.030(1)(c), each defendant was required to disprove the very fact of his participation in the crime as either a principal or an accomplice, relieving the State of its burden on the issue. The court noted that the defense was framed in the conjunctive. An accused had to establish all four subsections by a preponderance of the evidence. The statutory defense, when read as a whole, negated none of the elements the State was required to prove, i.e., that defendants took personal property from the victim by the use or threatened use of force, in the course of which activity the victim's death was caused. The defense merely permitted an accused to disprove his participation in the homicidal act, not in the underlying felony, and to establish that he was not armed and was ignorant of his partner's being armed and of the likelihood of death or serious injury.</SPAN></P>

Later, police obtained a search warrant and searched the residence and car. The court held the seizure of the keys was a reasonable intrusion limited in scope to the extent necessary to have secured the automobile and there was probable cause to have searched the car. The court held the warrantless entry was proper as there was concern for the safety of the police and public, and there was concern the wife might have left with the gun.

The father counterclaimed that the parties had an oral contract for the mother to use birth control, that the mother's cessation of birth control precautions constituted negligence, negligent or intentional misrepresentation, or fraud, that the mother's refusal to abort violated the last clear chance doctrine, and that dismissal of the father's counterclaim violated the father's constitutional equal protection rights. The court held that the father's counterclaim was not relevant to the needs and requirements of the child or to either the child's or the mother's ability to meet those needs and respond to those requirements, and could not properly be raised in connection with the determination of the amount of the father's child support obligation in an action brought under the UPA.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters of the county adopted a proposed charter as the new Whatcom County Home Rule Charter. The charter created a 7-member, part-time county council and a full-time elected county executive. The charter provided the three incumbent county commissioners with automatic seats on the new part-time and lesser paid county council for the balance of the full term to which they were originally elected as commissioners, and continued their higher commissioner's salary for the balance of those terms. The charter also provided that if any of the three chose to run for the new and higher paying office and the effort failed, then that person would be paid no more than the other part-time county council members. The court held that because the office of county commissioner was abolished by adoption of the Home Rule Charter for Whatcom County, the reduction of the commissioner's salary was not constitutionally prohibited. The court also held that the compensation provision of Charter &sect; 10.40 was rationally related to the county's legitimate interest in preserving the continuity and integrity of its government and was therefore not invalid on equal protection grounds.</SPAN></P>

The hearing examiner concluded that he did not have jurisdiction to decide the developer's arguments. The county council approved that decision.

The court held that (1) the hearing examiner and the county council both lacked jurisdiction to consider the issue of equitable estoppel, (2) the notice preceding the adoption of the enactment satisfied due process, and (3) the administrative record was insufficient to permit judicial consideration of equitable estoppel. The court found that pursuant to Wash. Rev.

The association claimed that the definition and the ordinance conflicted with the Act. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendants, and the association appealed. The court affirmed the judgment, ruling that the DOE did not exceed its authority by approving an ordinance that conflicted with the Act. Administrative rules and local ordinances adopted under a legislative grant of authority were presumed to be valid and were upheld if they were reasonably consistent with the statute, absent a compelling showing of reasons why they were in conflict with the legislation. Defendants submitted affidavits showing that the property owner's land was not within a floodway or part of the shoreline, and that it was not subject to the Act. The association failed to produce specific facts showing that the ordinance conflicted with the Act's purpose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Superior Court for Island County (Washington) for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DWI). Defendant's conviction followed a trial de novo in the superior court as an appeal from an earlier conviction in a district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of DWI following a bench trial in a district court. He appealed and filed a motion for deferred prosecution under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.05. The trial court denied his motion and, after a jury trial, defendant was again convicted of DWI. The court affirmed. The court noted that the language of &sect; 10.05 was not ambiguous or subject to judicial construction. Defendant was entitled by statute to move for deferred prosecution only in the district court. Since he failed to do so until his appeal to the trial court, there was no error in the trial court's denial of his motion. The court declined to consider defendant's objections to the admission of Breathalyzer test results at his trial because he was asserting different grounds on appeal than those he asserted in the trial court. Finally, the court concluded that the trial court did not intend to penalize defendant for exercising his appeal rights when it imposed a harsher sentence than that originally imposed by the district court. The court noted that defendant's sentence was still far below the statutory maximum and was quite reasonable in light of his two prior DWI convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's DWI conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorists received speeding tickets. Prior to their hearings in municipal court, the motorists filed a class action suit against the city and alleged that the city's procedures for adjudicating and processing traffic infractions failed to comply with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.63.060 and that the use of radar devices to give tickets violated due process. The trial court dismissed the complaint. The city dismissed the three traffic cases pending the appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's dismissal. The court first found that dismissal of the traffic infraction cases did not render the motorists' cause of action moot because it did not affect their damage claim for past misconduct of the city or their claim for declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin future misconduct. The court held that the superior court did not have jurisdiction to consider the request for declaratory and injunctive relief but did have jurisdiction to consider the claim for damages based on malicious prosecution. The court held that the complaint failed to state a claim based on malicious prosecution because there was no allegation that that the procedures were motivated by malice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also claimed the police lacked probable cause to arrest him, and that the evidence of the track made by a police dog should have been excluded. Defendant claimed that the jury instruction defining &quot;serious physical injury&quot; permitted a rape conviction with less showing of harm than required by statute, and that the denial of a continuance violated his constitutional rights. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that both probable cause and exigent circumstances existed to justify the policeman's entry into the house, and that dog tracking evidence was admissible.

The court held that defendant's warrantless arrest was lawful because the facts within the knowledge of the arresting officer at the time of the arrest were sufficient to establish probable cause. Thus, the court also upheld the denial of the motion to suppress defendant's statements made to the arresting officer. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient to conclude that defendant assaulted one of the store's security officers. He did not establish the defense of others defense because defendant knew who the security officers were and that they had the right to arrest the shoplifter. The court further held that the false arrest ordinance, Seattle, Wash. Crim.

The court rejected the overbreadth and vagueness arguments. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the ordinance was vague as applied. The court found that the ordinance did not contain a vague section. The prohibited behavior was clearly indicated and &quot;innocent&quot; behavior was not prohibited.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties married in March 1978 in Minnesota and separated in mid-1978, except for a one-month period, commencing in November 1978, when they cohabited in Washington. They engaged in sexual intercourse during that month. The mother gave birth to a child in Washington in August 1979. The mother filed a paternity action in Washington. A default judgment was entered against the father. On appeal, the father argued that the Uniform Parentage Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.26.080(2), was unconstitutional because it granted personal jurisdiction over him solely on the basis of an act of sexual intercourse performed within the state. The court found that obtaining personal jurisdiction over the father on the basis of &sect; 26.26.080(2) was proper. First, the father was served and had actual knowledge of the action. Second, the cause of action arose from the father's act of sexual intercourse in Washington. Finally, it did not offend traditional notions of fair play or substantial justice to hold that a man who fathered a child in Washington had sufficient contacts with the state to support the assertion of personal jurisdiction in an action concerning that child.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, an information was filed in superior court charging him with third degree assault, a felony. The assault charge was based on the same incident as the resisting arrest charge.

In affirming the conviction, the court disagreed. The charge of resisting arrest in municipal court was dismissed prior to trial. Thus, constitutional double jeopardy did not attach. Wash. Rev.

The parties told an officer that defendant was driving. Several days later, the driver of the other vehicle told officers that codefendant was driving. Defendant and codefendant agreed to tell officers that defendant was driving because she had insurance. They were cited for violating ordinance &sect; 10.16.030. They appeared pro se at trial and were convicted. They contend that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and they were not aware of their constitutional rights before pleading. In affirming the convictions, the court found that the ordinance was not vague on its face because it clearly prohibited making knowingly false statements to public officers. The ordinance was not vague as applied to defendant and codefendant because their conduct matched the hard core of prohibited activity. They validly waived right to counsel and a jury trial because they both signed advice of rights forms, they were orally advised of their rights by the trial judge, they were given an opportunity to have questions about such rights clarified, and they acknowledged that they understood their rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree robbery and attempted robbery. He was then charged by supplemental information with being a habitual criminal. Defendant challenged the validity of the four out-of-state felony convictions that gave rise to his habitual criminal charge. However, the court upheld defendant's conviction as a habitual offender on appeal. The court held that defendant's Utah theft conviction was sufficient for purposes of the habitual offender statute because the indictment under which he was convicted stated facts that constituted the minimum elements of the Washington felony of possessing stolen property pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.56.140(1). The court disallowed defendant to challenge for the first time on appeal the constitutionality of the jury instructions that resulted in his Utah burglary conviction and held that the conviction was properly used to establish his habitual offender status. Furthermore, the court found a sufficient factual basis in the record to support defendant's guilty plea to two California forgery charges. Thus, the court held that these convictions were also properly used to support defendant's adjudication as a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendants were convicted of possessing a controlled substance, cocaine. They appealed, contending the evidence against them was obtained as a result of an unlawful search and seizure. The court affirmed the convictions. Defendants contended, in part, that the items should have been suppressed because the officers' observations while looking through the front window of a residence, while investigating a report of a burglary, constituted an unreasonable search. They argued that they evidenced a privacy expectation by partially drawing the drapes to that window. They further asserted that the officers had no right to make their observations from the shrubbery area since it was not a normal walkway. The court disagreed. The officers were legitimately on the premises investigating a reported potential burglary when they observed the illegal activity. Positioning themselves by the window, only a few steps from the walkway to the front door was necessary both for their protection and to carry out their obligation to investigate. Under the circumstances, such a minimal departure from the usual access route to the front door was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an argument with the victim, defendant brandished a knife and stabbed the knife into a counter top. The court found no error in the jury instructions. Because &quot;assault&quot; was not statutorily defined, the common law definition was applicable, which referred to an attempt, with unlawful force, to inflict bodily injury upon another, accompanied with the apparent present ability to give effect to the attempt if not prevented. An assault was committed merely by putting another in apprehension of harm, whether or not the actor actually intended to inflict or was capable of inflicting that harm. The trial court correctly so instructed the jury, while allowing defendant an opportunity to argue that the victim's apprehension was not reasonable. Further, the jury was properly instructed that it could consider a lesser included offense without first unanimously agreeing on defendant's innocence of the assault charge.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and found that the officers had a well founded suspicion that defendant was connected to potential criminal activity and, thus, were entitled to stop and question him. Because the officers were entitled to stop and question defendant, any information gained by them during this initial stop was properly admissible at trial. The court also held that the Miranda warnings given defendant were sufficient and did not have to be repeated once defendant understood them, that the impoundment of defendant's truck was proper under the circumstances, that the burglary and rape charges did not merge, that his sentence was constitutional and could be cumulative as provided for by the charging statute, and that defendant's other contentions lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

They discovered substantial defects in the foundation that the contractor unsuccessfully tried to repair. The homeowners filed an action alleging breach of the implied warranty of habitability, and the trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the statute of limitations had run. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the implied warranty did not arise out of the document of sale, but arose from a common law duty of strict liability that the builder-seller owed to the first purchaser-occupant, and thus, the action was not governed by the six-year statute of limitations for written contracts. The court ruled that the contractor breached the implied warranty and caused the homeowners' damages, but it held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.310 limited the time in which actions against a contractor accrued and did not provide a six-year statute of limitations for claims based on real property improvements. The court concluded that the contractor was not estopped from asserting the statute of limitations because his actions did not cause the homeowners to delay filing their action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was incarcerated in a penitentiary pursuant to felony convictions and he filed suit following the officials' refusal to allow him to vote. Before an answer was filed, the trial court granted defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings. On appeal, the court ruled that Wash. Const. art. 6, &sect; 3, which operated to exclude convicted felons from the voting process, was a permissible exercise of the right of states to control the qualifications of persons voting in state and federal elections, under U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2, and did not violate the prisoner's equal protection rights. The court rejected the prisoner's claim that the denial of suffrage was cruel and unusual punishment. Wash. Const. art. 6, &sect; 3 was sustained as a non-penal exercise of the power to regulate the franchise, and its purpose was to designate a reasonable ground of eligibility for voting. Because defendants filed a motion to dismiss prior to their answer, defendants' motion was thus one to dismiss for failure to state a claim, under Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12(b)(6). No hypothetical state of facts existed under which the prisoner was entitled to relief, and thus the motion was properly granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was paid $ 9,000 over his first three months, which the trial court found as fact was &quot;salary.&quot; The parties then negotiated a five-year employment contract, effective as of the first day of the employee's fourth month of work. The employee quit after nine more months. On appeal, the court held that the employee was entitled to have reasonable attorney's fees assessed against the company pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.48.030. The denial of such fees was appealable, because the fees were not sought as part of the costs of the action, but rather as additional damages for the company's failure to comply with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.48.010, which required the company to pay him the wages due at the end of the established pay period under the five-year contract. The court explained the superior court's error. The company violated &sect; 49.48.010, because it failed to pay the employee the wages he was due on the day he quit, the end of the contractually provided pay period. The $ 9,000 could not be considered a draw against the salary under the five-year contract, because that contract did not begin until the first day of the fourth month that the employee worked for the company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company challenged a ruling of the Superior Court for King County (Washington), which entered an order of public use and necessity that allowed appellee, Port of Seattle (port), to take by eminent domain a parcel of land owned by the company. The company argued that the port's exercise of eminent domain was not authorized by statute, that the use authorized was not a public use, and that there was no necessity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A resolution established a development district and designated the area as part of a comprehensive scheme of harbor improvements. The port started condemnation proceedings against the company's land to continue its development of the area, seeking to use the land as a possible site for another company to relocate its plant. The trial court found that it was a public use for the port to acquire the company's property for development. On appeal, the court affirmed the ruling. To adjudicate public use a court must determine whether the proposed use was a public use, whether the public interest required it, and whether the property was necessary to facilitate public use. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 53.08.010 gave the port the power to acquire land by condemnation for its purposes and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 53.25 gave the port eminent domain powers for acquiring land for an industrial development district. Wash. Const. art. 8, &sect; 8, amend. 45, declared that public funds may be used for industrial development and that such use was a public use for a public purpose. Thus, the port had authority under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 53.25.100 as enlarged by the amendment to condemn the company's property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order of public use and necessity in favor of the company in the condemnation case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was entitled to relief due to evidentiary, procedural, prosecutorial, and sentencing errors. The State prevailed. The trial court properly denied defendant's request for a transcript from his first trial because defendant had alternative devices available to fulfill the same functions as a trial transcript. Defendant suffered no harm when he was impeached with a prior conviction because the trial court properly weighed the myriad factors used to balance the probity and prejudice of such evidence. The prosecutor's remarks, when viewed against the backdrop of all the evidence, did not so taint the proceedings that defendant did not have a fair trial. The prosecutor committed no misconduct by asking defendant for evidence that supported his version of his story. The judge's jury instructions were not comments on the evidence because the instructions were accurate statements of the law. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.52.050, defendant's convictions for first degree burglary and second degree assault did not violate right against double jeopardy. The amendment of defendant's information did not violate defendant's speedy trial rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court for King County, Washington, which convicted him of attempting to elude a pursuing police vehicle, in violation of the &quot;felony flight&quot; statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.024.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant refused to stop despite pursuit by marked police cars. Defendant avoided a blockade, ran red lights, and drove at an excessive rate of speed while weaving in and out traffic. He did not stop until he struck an embankment, and an officer had to force him off of the embankment. Defendant claimed that a liquor drink had caused a drug-like reaction and that he had no recollection of the events until up to his presence on the embankment. On appeal from defendant's conviction, the court held that defendant was not denied equal protection of the law when he was charged with felony flight instead of a misdemeanor. Furthermore, the trial court did not commit reversible error when it refused to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of reckless driving because there was no indication that such an instruction would have produced a different result. The court reasoned that the jury clearly rejected defendant's intoxication defense and was unanimous in concluding that he was guilty of the charged crime. The court also concluded that defendant was not denied his right to counsel when he was required to decide whether to submit to a breath test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The non-profit organization and four individual licensed handgun owners brought an action against the city seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the ordinance was unconstitutional and preempted by state law. The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the right to own and bear arms was only minimally reduced by limiting their possession in bars. The benefit to public safety by reducing the possibility of armed conflict while under the influence of alcohol outweighed the general right to bear arms in defense of self and state. The ordinance was narrowly drawn and demonstrated legislative concern for reasonable exercise of the police power where liquor by the drink was dispensed. The court concluded that the ordinance was constitutionally valid. The legislature had not indicated an intention to preempt municipal regulation in all areas of gun control, and the ordinance did not purport to contradict or restrict any provision of the statute. Therefore, the statute and ordinance were not inconsistent.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant to probation for three hours, to be spent at his attorney's office, and dismissed the case the same day. The court reversed the sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. Because the trial judge failed to order defendant to report to the secretary of corrections or his designate, the order granting defendant probation was void. Moreover, Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.95.230, .240 contemplated, first, the imposition of conditions of probation which have some logical connection with the ultimate objective of rehabilitation and, subsequently, satisfactory performance of those conditions by the probationer. The period of defendant's probation was so short that the objective of the statutory scheme was impossible of attainment. Thus, the resulting dismissal violated the statute because there had been no probation which would have qualified defendant for the benefits of the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An owner received a notice that the District was going to call for a treasurer's deed unless the owner's delinquent irrigation assessment was paid. Approximately two months later, a tax deed was issued to the District. Over 17 years later, the District became aware that a statutory warranty deed conveyed the property from the owner to the grantee. The District commenced an action to quiet title. The court reversed the superior court's decision that rendered summary judgment in favor of the District. The Fourteenth Amendment and Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3 provided that no person was to have been deprived property without due process of law. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 87.03.310, which provided for the sale of delinquent property in irrigation assessments upon the posting of a 20-day notice, was unconstitutional.

The grantee was allowed to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 97.03.310 for the first time on appeal. Since the procedure in &sect; 97.03.310 deprived the owner of the due process of law, the superior court lacked jurisdiction; thus, its act was void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm, a violation of &sect; 9.41.040, while his underlying conviction for second degree burglary was on appeal. The trial court entered judgment and sentence on the &sect; 9.41.040 charge. Defendant sought reversal of his firearms conviction after his burglary conviction was reversed. The court noted the conflict between Washington and United States Supreme Court case law regarding the validity of an underlying conviction, which supported a firearms conviction. However, &sect; 9.41.040 imposed a firearms disability on anyone who had been convicted of a crime of violence, such as burglary. The scope of the restriction was broad. The plain language of &sect; 9.41.040 was not modified in any way to suggest an exception for felons with outstanding convictions on appeal. Section 9.41.040 unequivocally imposed the disability on &quot;anyone who has been convicted.&quot; Accordingly, the language of &sect; 9.41.040, coupled with public policy concerns voiced by the United States Supreme Court, mandated a holding that defendant's prior conviction disqualified him from possessing a firearm, regardless of the subsequent reversal of his underlying conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Superior Court for King County, Washington, for being a habitual criminal. His conviction was based on convictions in 1981 and 1976 for possession of stolen property in the first degree, along with a 1969 grand larceny convictions and a 1976 conviction for taking and riding a motor vehicle without the owner's permission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted as a habitual criminal based on evidence of three prior convictions for felonies. Defendant claimed on appeal that he was denied due process of law because all three of the prior convictions allegedly resulted from unconstitutional jury instructions and therefore should not have been admitted into evidence. However, the court affirmed the habitual criminal conviction. First, the court found that defendant had waived his right to appeal on the basis that the prior convictions were constitutionally invalid because he failed to raise the issue before the trial court. Although under State v. Williams a defendant could in some cases challenge for the first time on appeal the validity of a guilty plea supporting a prior conviction used to show his status as a habitual criminal, the court refused to extend the Williams rule to convictions resulting from jury trials, thus creating a new method of collateral attack on prior convictions, absent the imprimatur of the United States Supreme Court. Direct appeals and habeas corpus petitions were the appropriate avenues of redress for the errors defendant alleged in his earlier convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second degree burglary and found to be a habitual criminal. Defendant appealed, alleging that, for the purpose of preserving the issue only, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.52.040, which allowed a jury to infer criminal intent from a person's actions to prove burglary, was unconstitutional. Defendant also claimed that his prior guilty pleas were not shown to be constitutionally valid. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for re-sentencing. The court held that it did not need to thoroughly discuss the constitutionality of &sect; 9A.52.040 because defendant conceded that prior cases clearly established that the statute was constitutional. Thus, the only actual issue was whether the trial court erred in determining that defendant's prior guilty pleas were constitutionally valid. In a habitual criminal proceeding, the State had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the prior conviction was based on a valid guilty plea. The court found that the State failed to present evidence showing that defendant knew of his right to remain silent for several of the prior pleas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by information with five counts of robbery in the first degree and two counts of assault in the first degree. The charges arose out of a series of armed robberies committed by defendant and three others. The information also alleged that each of the offenses was committed by defendant while armed with a deadly weapon that was also a firearm. Defendant was convicted of five counts of first degree robbery while armed with a deadly weapon, a firearm, and one count of first degree assault while armed with a deadly weapon, a firearm. Defendant appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The parties disputed whether the application of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.95.040, the deadly weapon statute, to a prosecution for first degree robbery or for first degree assault violated the double jeopardy clause by imposing multiple punishments for the same crime. The court held that &sect; 9.95.040 was a penalty enhancement statute and that &sect; 9.95.040 did not create a separate offense. Section 9.95.040 merely limited the discretion of the trial court and the Board of Prison Terms and Paroles in the setting of minimum sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that the case against him should have been dismissed because the prosecution did not comply with Wash. Justice Ct. Crim. R. 3.08. Upon review, the court found defendant's argument without merit. The prosecution argued that defendant's request for continuance made one day prior to trial was a postponement requested by defendant and that there was good cause for the change of trial date to a date beyond the 60-day period. The court agreed with the prosecution's position. The record supported the conclusion that defendant's request for a continuance one day before the originally scheduled trial date caused the case to be set beyond the 60-day limit. The trial date of February 10 was the first available trial date in the calendar dates reserved for cases such as the one against defendant. Defendant had time to object to the February 10 trial date well in advance of the expiration of the 60 days and thereby afford the trial court an opportunity to set a trial date within the 60 days if it was reasonably possible to do so.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the superior court's judgment. The court held that defendant's illegal arrest invalidated the third degree assault conviction because the obstructing statute under which he was arrested had been declared unconstitutional. However, although defendant had a right to defend himself against the unlawful arrest, whether he used reasonable force under the circumstances was a question for the jury. Further, the court held that the superior court's instruction regarding the lawfulness of defendant's arrest prejudiced the malicious mischief conviction.

The court affirmed his conviction. The court agreed that an equal protection violation would arise if the legislature passed two statutes giving the prosecutor the discretion to charge either a felony or a misdemeanor for the same act committed under the same circumstances. For purposes of determining whether there was such a violation, the actions of the city would be considered the actions of the state. However, defendant's conviction did not have to be reversed because the city ordinance was not available as a charging alternative. Pursuant to Wash.

Code &sect; 9.92.090. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment convicting and sentencing defendant for the charged offenses. Specifically, the court rejected defendant's argument that he was erroneously convicted for statutory rape because no testimony was introduced as to his marital status or that of the victims. Instead, the court held that the testimony, when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, was more than sufficient to enable a rational trier of fact to infer beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had not been married to either of the victims in the case. Similarly, the court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A did not run afoul of the First Amendment, given the overriding governmental concern for the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the children involved. Lastly, the court rejected defendant's argument that he was improperly charged with and convicted of promoting prostitution in the first-degree. Rather, the court held that the prosecutor did not abuse her discretion in charging the offense, which was warranted by the available evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the privilege fee occurred in state, was imposed upon the purely local privilege of doing business in the state of Washington, and that the fish processors lacked standing to challenge the statute's constitutionality because the fish processors suffered no economic injury. The court reversed the trial court and held that the fish processors had standing to challenge the statute's constitutionality and that the statute was unconstitutional. The fish processors suffered the economic injury of paying the tax and were asserting their rights to trade in interstate commerce and in Indian commerce, free from discriminatory taxes for the privilege of doing so.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who were juveniles, pleaded guilty to second degree burglary as a result of breaking into the victim's basement and stealing various items, including a coin collection and several weapons. The trial court ordered defendants to pay restitution to the victims in an amount that was based upon the victim's estimate of the value of the lost property rather than the amount that the victims claimed they took. Defendants appealed, claiming that the evidence was insufficient to support the amount of restitution ordered and that the restitution provisions of the Act were unconstitutionally vague. The court ruled that the evidence was sufficient to support the amount of restitution ordered by the trial court where the victim's testimony as to the value of the lost property was sufficient to afford a reasonable basis for the amount of the victim's loss. Finally, although juvenile disposition standards were subject to a vagueness challenge, the restitution provisions of the Act were not within the disposition standards of the Act and did not affect defendants' liberty interest or prohibit particular conduct. Thus, defendants' vagueness challenge was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 9A.56.095, instead of under the general first degree theft statutes for wrongfully obtaining or exerting unauthorized control over the rental automobile, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.56.010-.030. The court concluded that the charge and conviction of first degree theft was proper. The general theft statutes and the special leased or rented vehicle statute were not concurrent and, in any event, the discretion vested in the prosecuting attorney to selectively enforce criminal statutes was not unconstitutional unless it was based on unconstitutional standards, which was not the situation in the instant case. Further, under the facts, the jury as the rational trier of the fact could have found such elements of the crime of theft in the first degree beyond a reasonable doubt. There was no error.</SPAN></P>

Because the two defendants did not demonstrate that their actions were religious, scientific, or educational in nature, the lewd conduct ordinance was not unconstitutional as applied to them.

The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case. The court stated that the investigatory stop of defendant was lawful as it was premised on a reasonable suspicion, based on articulable facts, that he had been involved in criminal activity. The court determined that the arrest of defendant for obstructing was invalid since it was based on a statute which the state supreme court subsequently held to be unconstitutionally vague. The court stated that the trial court thus erred to the extent that it did not suppress the evidence which resulted from that unlawful arrest. The court noted that since the tainted evidence could be excised out, leaving evidence which would be legally sufficient, the case would be remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the massage parlor contended that the provisions of an ordinance that required windows and permitted inspections of a massage parlor violated the massage parlor's rights to equal protection of the law and freedom from unreasonable searches. The superior court's decision was affirmed. The court held that there was no denial of equal protection or privacy rights, and there was no unconstitutional search authorized by the ordinance. It held that the right to give or receive a massage did not rise to the level of the fundamental activities, and the rational relation test applied. The windows and inspectors were rationally related to the purpose of preventing prostitution. Further, the court held that warrantless inspections were valid for businesses regulated by government regulation, and unannounced inspections were necessary to ensure compliance where authorized by statute and where they delineated the scope, time, and place of inspection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant applied for employment as a custodial officer with the county sheriff's department and failed to disclose a prior conviction on his application. The civil service commissioners subsequently found out about his prior conviction and informed him that it precluded him from legally carrying a firearm and, therefore, from being hired as a custodial officer. The applicant secured a pardon but was still denied employment. He filed suit against defendants, alleging wrongful denial of employment, and defendants argued that the applicant's false answer on his application justified the department's refusal to hire him. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the applicant's suit. The court reversed the trial court's decision on appeal, holding that the false statement could not be used as a basis of refusing to hire him, and the applicant's pardon authorized him to carry a weapon, thereby affording him the benefit of the 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1203 exception. The court concluded that summary judgment was improper because genuine issues of material fact were raised regarding whether the commissioner waived its right to disqualify the applicant.</SPAN></P>

The petition was dismissed because of a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, a failure to join an indispensable party, and a failure to file within 30 days as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 58.17.180.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although it filed nine months late, the association contended its challenge was timely because there was defective notice of the hearing. The court held that, because the statutory notice requirements of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 58.17.090 had been satisfied, the association's attack was, in essence, an attack on the constitutionality of that statute. The association bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 58.17.090 was unconstitutional. It did not meet that burden. The association offered no proof that a combination of publication and posting was unreasonable. The trial court correctly determined that the association's appeal with respect to the first plat was untimely. As to the second plat, the association's petition was dismissed for a failure to exhaust remedies and to name an indispensable party. The council had not yet made a final decision, it could not assert an exhaustion argument. The court held that the association's failure to appeal the examiner's recommendation did not preclude judicial review of the council's final action approving the second preliminary plat and that an amended petition related back for the indispensable party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the trial court had the discretion to offset the award of a nondisability military pension to the ex-husband, a military retiree, by awarding community property of comparable or equal value to his ex-wife. The trial court characterized all the assets, including the military pension, as community property but awarded to the ex-husband the entire military pension, and offset it by awarding to the ex-wife other property of equal value. The remaining properties were divided but were substantially unequal. The court concluded that the trial court erred in dividing the property because the treatment of the pension in the property division conflicted with and sufficiently frustrated federal objectives because the military pension was not community property and was not subject to an offsetting award of property of comparable value.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the court held that the damage to the clients was not reasonably foreseeable. The court held that the Act was not violated. The title company's actions were not unfair or deceptive because it performed its duties in accordance with the closing instructions and it did not hold itself out as an attorney or tax specialist.

He claimed that the jury interpreted the instruction as a mandatory presumption, and that the trial court should have given an explanatory instruction. The court rejected the argument concluding that the trial court properly told the jury, in effect, to go back and reread its instructions. The court concluded that upon doing so, the jury raised no further questions, and that there was not anything in the record to indicate that the jury had any difficulty in arriving at its verdict.

Police found cases of beer and wine, cigarettes, and loose papers in the car from the food store. The court rejected defendant's argument that not instructing the jury on the elements of theft was error and that if theft was the underlying crime, then it was an element of burglary. The court opined that the State was not required to charge and prove intent to commit a particular crime, but only the presence of criminal intent at the time of illegal entry, so that jury unanimity as to it was not required, and the underlying crime, if committed, could be charged and punished separately. The court noted that defendant could unlawfully enter a building intending to commit a certain crime and ultimately commit a different crime or none at all, but he was still guilty of burglary. The court observed that burglary and possession of stolen property shared no elements, so the trial court properly refused to give a lesser included offense instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police department dismissed the officer without advising him of the charges against him or the opportunity for a hearing. On appeal, the officer argued that the failure to provide a pretermination hearing rendered his discharge constitutionally invalid. The trial court found that substantial evidence supported the dismissal but that the department's manual and the collective bargaining agreement required a pretermination hearing. On appeal, the court affirmed the officer's reinstatement but reversed the award of attorney's fees for administrative and trial court proceedings. The court reasoned that the officer had a property interest in continued employment because he could only be discharged for cause. The department's regulations required a pretermination hearing and limited the police chief's authority, pending the hearing, to order the officer's suspension. The regulations established elements of a substantive property interest and their violation gave rise to a prima facie deprivation of due process. The officer had a significant interest in having his case heard by a neutral panel. The trial court lacked jurisdiction to award fees in the certiorari proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court below convicted appellant of the offense of DWI. On appeal, the court found that the detention of appellant and the arrest that followed were lawful. It was well established that a police officer with a well founded suspicion of criminal activity could stop and detain a person for investigative purposes even though the officer's suspicion does not amount to probable cause to arrest. The court held that once the lawful stop was made and the officer observed the drunken condition of appellant, probable cause existed for the arrest of appellant. Further, the court held that the refusal of the court below to give appellant's requested jury instruction was not error, because the subject matter was adequately covered in the other instructions. Finally, the court upheld the constitutionality of Seattle Municipal Code 11.56.020. Section 11.56.0202 did not contain a presumption, but a definition of the crime. Under the statute, driving with a 0.10 blood alcohol content was one method of committing the crime of DWI.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury asked the trial court during deliberations whether the law precluded a knife of less than three inches from being a deadly weapon. The trial court replied in the negative and declined defense counsel's request for further instructions. Defendant was convicted and sentenced as a habitual offender. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court's response to the jury's question improperly suggested that the knife offered in evidence was a deadly weapon, and that the deadly weapon verdict had to be stricken. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court found that both counsel were present and apprised of the jury's question. The trial court's response was legally correct. The court rejected defendant's argument that the prosecutor's failure to provide defense counsel with a complete pretrial list of all of defendant's prior convictions constituted governmental misconduct requiring dismissal of the habitual criminal proceedings under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 8.3. The court held that the prosecutor could not be charged with constructive notice of all of his county's records. The court held that Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested for selling marijuana. He was driving his car at the time. After he was convicted on drug charges, the owner's car was seized and the sheriff issued a forfeiture notice. Appellant filed suit to have the forfeiture statute declared unconstitutional and to obtain the return of his car and damages. The trial court granted summary judgment to respondents and the court affirmed. It found that the forfeiture statute was constitutional on its face, as it required notice to the owner within 15 days of the seizure and provided an opportunity to be heard. Further, seizure of a vehicle used to carry marijuana was an extraordinary situation justifying the lack of notice or a hearing before the property was seized. In addition, the forfeiture statute was applied constitutionally as there was a criminal trial and a conviction of appellant, which trial provided a pre-seizure notice and opportunity to be heard, and the sheriff seized the car only after the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had violated the controlled substances act. Finally, the seizure was reasonable when only 17 days elapsed between appellant's conviction and the seizure of the car.</SPAN></P>

The clinic owner contended that he was without knowledge of the terms of a stipulation made by the prior owner that the lots would be returned to residential use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clinic owner purchased two lots that had been the subject of a controversy between the prior owner and the city. An agreement was reached as a result of the controversy that provided a stipulation that the two lots would be returned to residential use in accord with the city's zoning and buildings code. The hearing examiner concluded that the clinic owner had purchased the lots with knowledge of the agreement made by the prior owner. The owner claimed ignorance of the terms of the agreement. The court first denied the owner's challenge to the manner in which the board of adjustment conducted its hearings and the claim of vagueness of certain terms in the zoning ordinance. The owner claimed that the board acted arbitrarily in assuming that the stipulation in the agreement between the prior owner and the city bound him as a new owner. The court held that the agreement was not recorded and therefore the owner never received constructive notice of the restriction. In addition, there was no evidence that the owner had actual notice of the terms of the agreement. The court remanded the case to the city for consideration of the owner's application for conditional use of the property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants drove past several &quot;No Trespassing&quot; signs and attempted to distribute political literature on the premises of a steel company. The court, after considering a previous case that had invalidated a conviction under Seattle, Wash. Municipal Code &sect; 12A.08.040 on vagueness grounds, concluded that only the second sentence of subsection (A) was invalid. Because the criminal trespass ordinance contained a severability clause, the court found that the trespass on private property portion of the ordinance was severable from the invalidated portion, which dealt with trespass on property open to the public. As severed, the trespass on private property portion of the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because it defined the essential elements of the crime in clear and unambiguous terms, providing the public with fair notice of the prohibited conduct so that a person of ordinary intelligence did not have to guess at the meaning of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The leave which led up to his termination involved him requesting the time away from the university, but the dean denied the request. The professor went on the trip anyway. The university concluded that it was shown by clear and convincing evidence that the professor had been insubordinate by his unapproved absence after being forewarned that disciplinary steps would be taken, and that he willfully and deliberately violated published institutional and related university rules and regulations which had a harmful impact on the department and its students. The university ended up cancelling the professor's classes. The court affirmed the university's dismissal of the professor finding that the disapproval of the leave by the dean was not unreasonable, that the professor was warned that if he ignored the directive disciplinary measures would be instituted, and that indeed the professor was insubordinate.

The court held that defendant's theory of self-defense hinged on his credibility and that he put his credibility into question when he opted to testify. The court affirmed and held that the State also had the right under Rule 609(a) to cross-examine defendant regarding the enhancement of his punishment for earlier crimes based on a habitual criminal finding because the information was shown on a judgment and sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court found that the trial court's interpretation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43(f)(1) was erroneous. The court observed that the individual was not seeking to compel the attendance of nonresident witnesses or have the trial court issue a subpoena outside Washington, but was requesting the corporation to have certain managing agents appear at trial. The court stated that Wash. Rev. Code 43 (f)(3) authorized the trial court to levy sanctions against the corporation, as the employer of the agents, if they failed to appear. The court found that failure of the corporation's managing agents to appear after notice was served on local counsel could have resulted in a contempt order against the corporation, even though the agents were beyond the reach of a subpoena. The court observed that because the attendance of the managing agents of a party could be compelled by sanctions against the corporation, which was already subject to the court's jurisdiction, there was no potential due process conflict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal of his second-degree assault conviction, defendant claimed that his due process rights were violated because the trial court failed to instruct the jury that the State had the burden to prove that defendant did not act in self-defense. Defendant argued that because a person acting in self-defense committed no crime, he acted with the intent to accomplish a lawful act, not with criminal intent or knowledge. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that proof of self-defense did not negate the mental state element in second-degree assault, and due process did not require the State to bear the burden of proving the absence of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the State was not required to prove anything other than the elements of the crime charged. Further, the court found that just because one acted in self-defense did not mean that he could not commit an assault. The court rejected defendant's claim that failure to allocate the burden of proof on self-defense violated defendant's due process rights because the failure worked to defendant's benefit.</SPAN></P>

At trial, he asserted as a defense that the victim had consented to sexual intercourse, and attempted to have evidence of her prior sexual conduct and general character admitted. The trial court refused to allow the evidence of prior sexual conduct or general character. Defendant was convicted and appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the victim's past sexual conduct had no relevance. The court found that evidence of the victim's prior sexual history was not allowable, although evidence to show the victim's distraught state of mind was admissible to show possible mistake or bias. The court found that details of the victim's past sexual history were not allowable to show consent. The court found that the fact that a juror offered the victim headache medicine during a recess was an innocuous conversation and did not warrant a mistrial because there was no prejudice to defendant, and because the trial court admonished the jury not to allow sympathy to affect their deliberations.

Rev. Code &sect; 46.80. The trial court rejected the argument that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.80.080 applied retrospectively and was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wrecker was licensed to operate an automobile salvage yard and was already required to place yard numbers on vehicles in his possession when the legislature amended Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.80.080 to impose greater record-keeping requirements and to require him mark all major components. On appeal, the court found that applying the statute to property in the wrecker's possession at the time of enactment of the law would not make it an unconstitutional ex post facto law because the statute was civil and not criminal in nature. The court found that the statute did not apply retroactively because it only required acts to be done after its effective date although it drew on antecedent facts for its operations. The court found that the purpose of the record-keeping requirements was to deter theft and fraud and that the legislature could require the wrecker to keep records and to mark major components in his possession. However, the court examined the statute and related rule and was not satisfied that the legislature had required such records for earlier-acquired major components. The court reasoned that marking the components served no purpose if the numbers did not relate to records.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the assessment of the civil penalty related to items acquired after the statute's effective date.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his perjury conviction was based on insufficient evidence. He also argued that upon the reversal of his perjury conviction, his theft conviction also should be reversed because the introduction of his perjury conviction at the theft trial was prejudicial error. On appeal, the court reversed both convictions. In so ruling, the court dismissed the perjury charge and concluded that the testimony used as evidence of perjury did not provide the type of positive, directly contradictory testimony required to support a perjury charge. The court concluded that because there was no testimony presented that directly and positively contradicted defendant's testimony as charged in the amended information, there was insufficient evidence of perjury. The court remanded the theft charge for a new trial because the admission of the perjury conviction for impeachment purposes at the theft trial was prejudicial error. The court noted that the perjury conviction was overturned on constitutional grounds and there was no way to predict what the jury would have decided had the conviction not been introduced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with second degree murder in the beating death of his girlfriend and two counts of third degree assault for resisting arrest. Following a mistrial on the murder charge, defendant pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter. The jury acquitted defendant on one count of third degree assault but convicted him on the second count. On appeal defendant contended that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the burden of proving voluntary intoxication. The court determined that the trial court's instruction on voluntary intoxication did not state which party had the burden of persuasion, but because the standard of proof was only a preponderance, the court assumed that the jury concluded that defendant had the burden. The court held that the jury instruction placed the burden of persuasion on defendant to negate an element that the State was required by statute to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Requiring defendant to prove voluntary intoxication required him to prove the absence of intent, an element of the crime, and therefore defendant was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, he filed a motion to dismiss, claiming a violation of his statutory right to a speedy trial under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 3.3. The trial judge denied the motion, but later he requested briefing on the constitutionality of rule 3.3(b). The trial judge ruled that rule 3.3(b) violated the Equal Protection Clause because it distinguished unfairly between defendants who received preliminary hearings in district court and those who received no preliminary hearings in district court. The court found that in challenging the constitutionality of rule 3.3, defendant did not carry his burden of demonstrating its invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt. He cited no authority holding rule 3.3 or similar statutes unconstitutional. There were reasonable and justifiable grounds for measuring the speedy trial time limits differently when a preliminary hearing was held in district court.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 9.31.005, and special verdicts on each count on the finding that he was armed with a deadly weapon and a firearm, Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.95.040, 9.41.025.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from a bank robbery that he participated in and from his assistance in the escape of a cohort from a hospital. On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress four eyewitness identifications on the grounds that the photographs and line-up were impermissibly suggestive. The court held that there was a low likelihood of misidentification and the circumstances indicated that the identifications were sufficiently reliable. The identifications also stood under the &quot;independent source&quot; test. Defendant's argument that the trial court's refusal to permit his expert witness to answer hypothetical questions was not a reversible error because the trial court had not abused its discretion in its determination that the questions would usurp the jury's fact-finding function. Defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's order that he would need permission to show the photograph of an alternate perpetrator because he was not denied permission and never attempted to display the photograph. The special verdicts were not reversible for lack of jury instruction because it was undisputed that a gun was used.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former employee filed a declaratory judgment action regarding the nonrenewal policy in his employment contract for violation of a residency policy for teachers. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted the former employer's motion and dismissed the action. In affirming the trial court's judgment on appeal, the court held that the former employee was not denied due process or equal protection of the laws by the nonrenewal process or the requirements for residency. The court found that the former employee did not have a fundamental right to his teaching position. The court stated that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28A.67.072 applied equally to all first-year teachers and that a probationary period was a legitimate prerequisite to the granting of public employment benefits. The court also stated that there was a rational basis for the probationary period because it allowed an employer to observe a provisional employee's performance prior to conferring more procedural protections under &sect; 28A.67.070. The court stated that a city could place residential requirements on its employees and found that the requirement was equally applied to all teachers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and her three children owned five dogs as family pets. All of the dogs were individually licensed, but defendant had refused to purchase a kennel license as required by Kitsap County, Wash., Code &sect; 7.12.100. Defendant was convicted in the county court, and the superior court affirmed her conviction. On review, the court reversed and vacated her conviction. The court held that the legislature had not provided counties with the authority to impose criminal sanctions on dog owners who failed to purchase kennel licenses where the dogs were owned solely as pets. The court found that defendant has proved the invalidity of the county ordinance beyond a reasonable doubt. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.49.010 only authorized a county to require kennel licenses when dogs were kept for breeding, sale, or sporting purposes. Because the county's ordinance required a kennel license where dogs were kept for any purpose, the court held that the ordinance, as applied to the facts of this case, conflicted with the express limitation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.49.010 and thereby violated the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the jury was instructed that to find defendant guilty of indecent liberties, it must find that he knowingly caused his stepdaughter to have sexual contact with him. By proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant acted purposely or intentionally, the court held that, by law, he also acted knowingly and that any error in giving the knowledge instruction was therefore harmless. The court further held that no abuse of discretion occurred in the trial court's admission of evidence of prior sexual contact. The court found that a reasonable person easily could conclude that the prejudicial effect of admitting evidence of the prior sexual contact did not substantially outweigh its probative value and that the trial judge, aware that the jury could misunderstand the purpose of the testimony, wisely cautioned them before the evidence was received.</SPAN></P>

The double jeopardy clause did not bar defendant's retrial for keeping a false account. A plain reading of the act revealed that two subdivisions required proof of an element that the other did not. Misappropriation of public funds could have been committed without keeping a false record and vice versa. The instructions gave no reasonable basis for the verdict other than that the jury remained unconvinced that defendant had committed those acts. The court could not conclude that the error was harmless. The jury may have convicted defendant solely on the deposit, but it could have convicted him for other acts, of which defendant denied any knowledge.

Defendant two was convicted of second-degree assault while armed with a deadly weapon as a habitual criminal. Defendant three was convicted of second-degree assault while armed with a deadly weapon and of violation. The court agreed with the State and held that defendants could not raise the validity of the prior guilty pleas for the first time on appeal. No error appeared on the record because defendants failed to raise the issue in the proceedings below. Absent a challenge by defendants to the validity of the underlying guilty pleas, there was not error in proving the prior convictions by introduction of certified judgments and sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record title holders acquired title to the property through mesne conveyances from the pretax foreclosure record title owner. Without naming or notifying the record title holders, the tax deed holders obtained the tax deed but never took possession of the property. The trial court set aside the tax deed and quieted title in favor of the record title holders. The tax deed holders sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the three-year statute of limitations, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.090, did not apply because the tax deed holders had not taken possession of the property. The court saw no reason to promulgate a rule imposing a burden on a person who was a successor of the original owner greater than the burden that was imposed on the &quot;original owner.&quot; Each successor was in privity with his predecessor in title. Thus, so long as the record title holders' possession was maintained to the exclusion of the holders of the void tax deed, the statute of limitations did not run against the record title holders. In other words, the continuing possession of the property by the record title holders tolled the statute of limitation.</SPAN></P>
