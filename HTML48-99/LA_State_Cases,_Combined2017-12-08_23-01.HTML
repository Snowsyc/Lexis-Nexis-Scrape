</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the charge given to jurors on reasonable doubt during his trial was unconstitutional in light of recently decided case law which discussed what was required for jury instructions on reasonable doubt. The trial court denied defendant's request for post-conviction relief on the ground that any error in the reasonable doubt instruction given to jurors in defendant's aggravated rape trial was harmless. The court held that the issue before it was whether the recently decided case law had to be applied retroactively to cases which were final at the time the decision was rendered. The court found that the Teague retroactivity standards were applicable in Louisiana state courts in cases on collateral review, and the court found that the recently decided case set forth a new rule. The court held, however, that neither of the Teague exceptions to retroactivity applied in defendant's case and thus, defendant was not entitled to raise the issue of the recently decided case in his post-conviction relief proceeding. The judgment denying relief was upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certiorari was granted on the request of defendant media company and employees to review a ruling from the Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, Parish of Bossier, State of Louisiana, which reversed the trial court's dismissal of a defamation suit. At issue was whether plaintiff mother and son had a cause of action for emotional distress or malicious infliction of mental pain and anguish due to defamation of their memory of the father by a news story.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A television station aired a story a day after the father's murder that his death may have been connected with gambling debts. At the trial court level, exceptions of no right of action and no cause of action were sustained, and the mother and son's defamation suit was dismissed. The court of appeal reversed concluding that the petition stated a cause of action for defamation of the mother and son's memory of the father under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:47. On review, the court pointed out that the news story did not concern the mother and son, nor did it reflect on their reputations. Absent an ability to allege the essential element of harm to the mother and son's reputation, they did not have a cause of action for defamation of the father. It was also argued that the petition asserted a separate cause of action for malicious infliction of mental pain and anguish under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:47(2), a criminal statute. The court found that &sect; 14:47 did not impose a civil duty to refrain from the conduct of defaming the dead; thus, it could not be the basis for creating a separate cause of action for malicious infliction of mental anguish.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeal. The judgment of the trial court was reinstated that sustained exceptions of no cause of action and no right of action and dismissed the defamation suit at the mother and son's cost.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff grandmother sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit (Louisiana), which reversed the trial court and held that damages awarded to the grandmother from defendant doctors were limited to $ 500,000, pursuant to the Medical Malpractice Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:1299(B)(1) and (3)(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother's grandchild had complications after surgery which left her blind, paralyzed, and retarded. The trial court awarded the grandmother damages in excess of $ 500,000. The doctors filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court denied. On appeal the lower court ordered that the summary judgment be entered. The grandmother appealed and the court affirmed the lower court's findings. The court held that the Act, which put a cap on medical malpractice awards, was constitutional. The court held that as an offset to the Act, Louisiana offered those most severely injured by medical malpractice three benefits: (1) greater likelihood that the offending physician or other health care provider had malpractice insurance; (2) greater assurance of collection from a solvent fund; and (3) payment of all medical care and related benefits. The court held that since the legislature's statutory solution to the medical malpractice problem furthered the state purpose of compensating victims, it was not constitutionally infirm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's grant of the doctors' motion for summary judgment and held that Louisiana's statutory cap on medical malpractice awards was not in violation of the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the attorney general and the clerk of the House of Representatives, appealed from a judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which held for plaintiff claimant in declaring that an act passed by the legislature was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the board of ethics for elected state officials. He maintained that Act No. 755, as amended and enacted, was unconstitutional as violative of freedom of expression, association, privacy and equal protection under the federal and state constitutions. After a hearing, the trial court declared that the act was unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement. The attorney general and the clerk of the House of Representatives appealed. The court found that the amendments were germane to the bill and did not violate the constitution. The amended version was relevant and pertinent to the bill because both versions of the bill served to effectuate the policy of governmental ethics in determining which persons were to be regulated in the private sector in their dealings with public servants. Since both versions also sought to add provisions to the governmental ethics code, the court concluded that the amended bill was germane to the bill as introduced. Thus, the trial court erred in declaring that the act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Nineteenth Judicial District Court (Louisiana), which required the state to administer antipsychotic drugs to defendant without his consent for the purpose of making him competent to the extent that he would understand the link between his crime and his punishment and thereby allowing the state to carry out his death sentence. Defendant filed an application for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was mentally ill, was sentenced to death. His symptoms could be temporarily diminished with medication. The court found that the execution plan was unconstitutional because there was no compelling state interest that would be measurably furthered by the state's medicate-to-execute scheme. The court concluded that the state's plan to medicate and execute defendant would violate his bodily integrity, chemically alter his mind and will, and usurp his fundamental right to make decisions regarding his health or medical treatment. The court held that the state's proposed action was not narrowly confined to the interests of prison safety and defendant's medical interest. The court determined that the punishment was cruel because it imposed more indignity, pain, and suffering than ordinarily was necessary for the extinguishment of life, excessive because it imposed a severe penalty without furthering any of the valid social goals of punishment, and unusual because it subjected to the death penalty a class of offenders that had been exempt therefrom for centuries and added novel burdens to the punishment of the insane which would not be suffered by sane capital offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's determination that defendant was insane and incompetent for execution, reversed the portion of the trial court's order authorizing and requiring the state to administer antipsychotic drugs to defendant against his will for purposes of execution, and stayed defendant's execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute. Defendant appealed and asserted arguments concerning the admissibility of recorded telephone conversations with co-conspirators, the exclusion of evidence offered to show lack of knowledge and participation in the conspiracy, ineffective assistance of counsel by reason of conflict of interest in representing an alleged co-conspirator, and his sentence. On review, the court held that the recorded statements of defendant's co-conspirators were admissible as defendant failed to show he withdrew from the conspiracy prior to the time of the statements. The court found that defendant was able to present his defense of no knowledge of or participation in the conspiracy through his testimony and other evidence. As to the counsel claim, the court observed that multiple representation did not presumptively result in ineffective assistance and that defendant did not object to this prior to or during his trial. But, the court remanded the case to the trial court for a full evidentiary hearing on the issue. The court finally rejected assertions regarding the excessiveness of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence were conditionally affirmed and the case was remanded to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel due to conflict of interest. If the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel had merit, the court was ordered to set aside the conviction and order a new trial. If the claim was without merit, defendant's right to appeal from that ruling was reserved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, former employees, and defendant, a primary liability insurer, appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, State of Louisiana, which was entered in plaintiffs' action to recover for plaintiffs' alleged injuries caused by long-term exposure to asbestos at their workplace.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, former employees, filed suit against defendant, the primary liability insurer of the employer's executive officers, alleging that the officers failed to provide a safe working environment, which resulted in plaintiffs' injuries caused by long-term exposure to asbestos. The court found contributory negligence law governed plaintiffs' case. Substantial injury-producing exposures giving rise to plaintiffs' claims occurred before the effective date of the statute enacting comparative fault. Since clear legislative intent showed that the statute was to be applied prospectively only, the law in effect at the time of the exposure controlled plaintiffs' claims. Also, the court held that virile share principles determined apportionment of liability among tortfeasors. Defendant's claim to contribution among joint tortfeasors arose at the time of the tort, and therefore, was to be decided according to the law in effect at that time, not comparative fault. The court also concluded that defendant's policies were able to be horizontally stacked to cover plaintiffs' injuries. Coverage was triggered by separate occurrences of exposure to harmful conditions during each policy period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Contributory negligence and virile share principles governed the claims arising from plaintiffs' long-term exposure to asbestos because such exposure occurred before the effective date of the statute adopting comparative fault. In addition, policies could be horizontally stacked because coverage was triggered by an occurrence of exposure during each policy period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted rehearing of an opinion finding that relator's application for post-conviction relief was properly denied by the court of appeal. Relator's application asserted that his 35-year sentence for purse snatching as a third offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 was improper because the two predicate convictions occurred on the same day.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator contended that the sentence was improper because the two predicate convictions occurred on the same day. On rehearing, the court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, as amended by 1982 La. Acts 688, was vague and ambiguous. The court concluded, therefore, that the amended habitual offender statute was to be strictly construed and that the doctrine of lenity required this strict construction of the statute most favorably to the accused. The court noted that, as it interpreted the statute, the sequential requirement for enhanced penalties in the sentencing of multiple offenders survived. The court reasoned that the cornerstone of that scheme was that felons graduated to second offender status, not by committing multiple crimes, but by committing a crime after being convicted. On this basis, the court concluded that relator was not properly a third offender because, although he had been convicted twice earlier, he had not been through the required sequencing of commission followed by conviction, then commission followed by another conviction. Thus, the court concluded that relator could only be charged as a second offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeal. The court nullified relator's 35-year sentence as a third offender for the purse snatching. The court remanded the case to the district court to re-sentence relator as a second offender for the crime of purse snatching.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his father were implicated in a robbery. Defendant was placed on trial, convicted, and sentenced. Defendant filed a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The evidence was that, after the trial, another person admitted to robbing the store at issue with another party, who bore a striking resemblance to defendant. This motion was ultimately denied. Defendant appealed this decision and eventually obtained a writ of certiorari. On review, the court held that the trial judge erred in denying defendant's motion for new trial. This was because the newly discovered evidence, it if had been admitted at defendant's trial, would have tended to discredit the eyewitness testimony which was already undermined by inconsistencies and discrepancies, by lack of physical evidence, by significant alibi evidence and by the fingerprint on the adhesive tape casing handled by the robber and preserved for police examination. The court concluded that the newly discovered evidence probably would have changed the verdict. Therefore, defendant was entitled to a new trial on the basis of the newly discovered evidence which would have been admissible at a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction and sentence for robbery were set aside and defendant's motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence was granted. The case was accordingly remanded to the district court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The carpenter was injured during her employment. She filed a claim for compensation form with the office of workmen's compensation, stating that a bona fide dispute existed as her employer failed to pay benefits and expenses.

The employer and insurer filed an exception of lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the proper forum was the hearing officer system. The trial court denied the exception and issued a preliminary injunction enjoining hearing officer proceedings. The employer and insurer appealed, and the court of appeal reversed, holding that when the suit was filed, the law provided for adjudication by hearing officers, dismissing the suit, and remanding to the hearing officer. Upon review, the court held that when the carpenter filed her petition, the proper forum was the hearing officer system, which was declared unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the judgment from the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Parish of Tangipahoa (Louisiana), which quashed defendant's indictment for violation of La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:202 (1986) and declared &sect; 14:202&nbsp;unconstitutional. Defendant was charged with a crime defined identically by two separate acts, 1986 La. Acts 625 and 1986 La. Acts 1040, which were passed during the same legislative session but contained different penalties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court noted that the case did not turn on whether either concurrently existing version of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:202 was unconstitutional. The determinative question was whether the two Acts could be reconciled consistent with their legislative intent or, if reconciliation were impossible, whether the latest enactment should be applied. Because the case involved construction of the penalty provision of a criminal statute, the principle of lenity was applicable. The court examined the minimum and maximum penalty of incarceration and fines set forth in the Acts to arrive at a statutory construction that set the range of incarceration and fine within the parameters of both acts. The court stated that its decision to give effect to both amendments did not constitute judicial rewriting of the statute but was an accepted method of statutory construction reflective of the intent of the lawmaker. Furthermore, both legislative enactments would not have been rejected unless both were independently unconstitutional on other grounds. The judgment of the district court declaring that &sect; 14:202 was unconstitutional was overturned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court that declared unconstitutional the statute under which defendant had been convicted and sentenced and the motion to quash, denied. The court remanded.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and noted that the appellate court reasoned that because the legislature provided a lesser penalty than for a conviction of criminally negligent homicide, it intended to proscribe less egregious conduct under the watercraft statute. The court originally agreed with the appellate court's construction of the statute and found that &quot;negligent&quot; was a sufficient standard. The court noted that in the past, it equated &quot;recklessness&quot; with &quot;criminal negligence&quot; and &quot;gross negligence.&quot; The court found that recklessness resulted from an act that the actor knew or should have known created a strong probability of harm, while negligence consisted of mere failure to take precautions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The raffle organizers were assessed a civil penalty for conducting unauthorized raffles in St. Martin Parish in violation of La.

They filed suit in the 16th Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Martin for a declaratory judgment declaring the pertinent statutes unconstitutional and seeking to enjoin the state agency from enforcing the fine assessed under the statutes. The State filed an exception of improper venue, and the trial court held that venue was proper under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5104. The court of appeal affirmed, and the court granted a writ of certiorari to review the judgment. On certiorari the court reversed the judgment, maintained the exception of improper venue, and transferred the case to the Parish of East Baton Rouge. The court held that although &sect; 13:5104 permitted suits against the State or a state agency in the parish in which the cause of action arose, and although the events which gave rise to the fine assessed by the state agency occurred in St. Martin Parish, the purpose of the suit was to declare the unconstitutionality of a statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal issue raised on appeal was whether the power to impose domicile requirements on municipal employees was vested in the municipal civil service commission or the city's municipal governing authority. The court reversed the judgment, finding that the power to establish residency or domiciliary requirements for the city's employees did not fall within the exclusive powers expressly or impliedly granted to the commission by La. Const. art. X, &sect; 10(A)(1). The court found that the power to adopt a residency requirement did not fall within the commission's express powers to adopt rules regulating the selection, hiring, promotion, or demotion of public employees on the basis of merit. Moreover, as to the objectives of civil service, a residency requirement was unrelated to the competitive selection and promotion of public employees on the basis of merit, fitness, and qualifications. Thus, the ordinance was not unconstitutional under La. Const. art. X, &sect; 10(A)(1). The court concluded that the power to adopt rules imposing domiciliary or residency requirements on municipal employees was within the power of the municipal governing authority constituting the legislative branch.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for declaratory judgment in the Family Court of East Baton Rouge Parish (Louisiana), alleging that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:396, which provided for court ordered blood testing in cases in which paternity was relevant, was not constitutional. The family court agreed, and held the statute unconstitutional. Plaintiff suspensively appealed that decision. The court granted a writ of certiorari to review the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:396 violated his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under U.S. amend. IV and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. He further contended that &sect; 9:396 violated his rights of due process and equal protection of the law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and La. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 3. In contrast, plaintiff contended that the statute had not violated any provision of either constitution. The burden of proof rested with the party who was challenging constitutionality to prove clearly that the statute was in conflict with a specific constitutional provision. Defendant had not met that burden. Because of the strong societal interest in the determination of parentage of minors and the minimal intrusion involved, the court found that court-ordered blood testing in paternity cases was constitutionally permissible if justified under the case's circumstances. As &sect; 9:396 was reasonably construed to require a proper showing in a show cause hearing before issuance of the order, it was not unconstitutional. As construed, it had not violated U.S. amend. IV, La. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, U.S. Const. art. XIV, or La. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 3.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court determined that the department's decisions were civil, and that judicial review of the department's decisions was an exercise of original jurisdiction that vested in the district courts. The court reversed and remanded, and noted that the legislature authorized the department to exercise quasi-judicial authority, and properly vested judicial review of the department's determinations with the appellate court. The court held that judicial review of a final order of the department, where the legislature did not specifically provide for de novo review, was the exercise of the court's appellate, rather than original, jurisdiction. The court held that because the state constitution permitted the legislature to provide for appellate jurisdiction in the district court, and because it failed to do so regarding the department's decisions, the legislature exercised its prerogative to confer jurisdiction over the department's decisions with the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal (Louisiana) reversed the trial court's reduction of the damages awarded to the corporation, but upheld the trial court's dismissal of the officers/shareholders' claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the reversal of the trial court's reduction of damages to the corporation, the court held that: (1) no written commitment was necessary in order for the bank to be bound by its oral pledge to finance the corporation's shipments of goods; (2) the jury reasonably could have found a breach of a contractual duty because the corporation sustained its burden of proving the existence of an agreement between itself and the bank with the testimony of the corporation's witnesses, the references to multiple shipments in the documents introduced into evidence, and the amount of collateral held by the bank; (3) the jury finding that the bank breached its fiduciary duty was not manifestly erroneous because the bank was aware of the corporation's plan to import the goods and knew what consequences its failure to issue timely letters of credit would have had on the delivery of those goods; and (4) the trial court was correct in reducing the damages awarded to the corporation because the bank had presented persuasive evidence that the fulfillment of all of the conditions of the corporation's contracts with the supplier was unlikely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit requesting declaratory and injunctive relief. They sought to have certain provisions of the CFA declared unconstitutional and prohibiting their implementation. The district court granted plaintiffs' motion in limine and motion to strike. It ruled that certain sections of the CFA were in conflict with La. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3(A). The court reversed the judgment. The court held that &sect; 3 was only a limitation on defendant Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE)'s other powers, not on its powers of supervision and control. The court concluded that when the BESE exercised its powers of supervision and control over the schools under the legislative mandate, it was not bound by the limitation in &sect; 3. The court ruled that the legislature could delegate the regulation of certification to the BESE under its powers of supervision and control. Certification was considered indispensable to the status of a teacher.</SPAN></P>

The trial court (Louisiana) convicted defendant of first-degree murder, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30, and sentenced him to death.

Defendant then went over to him and, as he pleaded for his life, shot him in the head and took his jewelry. At trial defendant admitted to firing the gun. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. The court affirmed. The United States Supreme Court remanded the matter, having found that the trial court's instruction on reasonable doubt violated the Due Process Clause. On remand the court once again affirmed the conviction and sentence, finding that the reasonable doubt instruction given by the trial court was a trial error subject to the harmless error analysis. The court held that because there was no significant evidence which would have caused reasonable doubt, the state met its burden of demonstrating that the trial error did not contribute to defendant's conviction or sentence. The court held that because of the overwhelming evidence establishing defendant's guilt, the erroneous instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, plaintiff utility company and defendants, public service commission (PSC) and state, appealed the orders of two Louisiana district courts, which reviewed the PSC's determinations with respect to the utility's requested rate increase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility requested a rate increase to recover a portion of its investment in a nuclear power plant. The PSC (1) disallowed part of the investment as imprudent, (2) granted a rate increase representing a 12 percent return on the utility's equity in the plant, and (3) approved a plan to phase-in the portion of the investment determined to be imprudent. The utility sought relief from the PSC's order pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:1192. The trial court issued an injunction granting a first-year increase representing a 14 percent return on investment. The utility's due process rights were not violated by the PSC's decision-making process, though the commissioners did not hear all evidence presented to the Hearing Examiner. The determination that a portion of the investment was imprudent was not arbitrary and capricious because the utility's decision to construct the plant was flawed. The PSC's decision to disallow the difference between the cost of the plant and the cost of a prudent alternative was reasonable. The district court did not have the authority to implement a rate base exclusion plan and it erred in ordering an increase in the utility's rate of return on equity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment upholding the PSC's disallowance of a portion of the investment. The court reversed and set aside the order to implement a rate base exclusion plan. The court reversed and set aside the judgment granting a preliminary injunction increasing the utility's rate of return on equity from 12 percent to 14 percent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff oil company's concursus suit, defendant riparian landowner applied for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment from the Court of Appeal, First Circuit (Louisiana), which reversed the trial court's judgment that the alluvion formed at the intersection of a river and a bay was owned by the landowner and not by defendant State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An oil company obtained mineral leases covering an alluvion formed at the intersection of a river and a bay. The State and a riparian landowner claimed ownership of the alluvion, and the company filed a concursus suit against the State and the landowner. The trial court held that the alluvion belonged to the landowner, but the appellate court reversed. On a writ of certiorari, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part the appellate court's judgment and remanded the case. The appellate court properly found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38:2356(M)(2) was inapplicable because &sect; 38:2356(M)(2) sought to prevent the loss of lands forming in a bay and did not implicitly declare that the alluvion formed prior to the effective date of &sect; 38:2356(M)(2) was privately owned. The evidence supported the appellate court's ruling that the bay was an arm of the sea. The evidence did not show the boundary between the bay and the river. Thus, it could not be determined if the alluvion formed on the river bank and thus belonged to the landowner under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 499, or if it formed on the shore of the bay and thus belonged to the State. Therefore, further evidence was needed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment finding that a bay was an arm of the sea and that the trial court used an inapplicable statute in reaching its judgment in favor of a riparian landowner on a concursus suit to determine the ownership of an alluvion. The court reversed the judgment finding that the State owned the alluvion. The court remanded the case to determine if the alluvion formed on a river's bank or the bay's shore.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff estate executrix challenged a decision from the Civil District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which denied the executrix relief in her action for a declaration that La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate executrix contended that &sect; 9:2448 was unconstitutional because it conflicted with La. State Bar R. Prof. Conduct, art. XVI, Rule 1.16(a)(3), and the power to regulate all facets of the practice of law belonged to the state supreme court. The state supreme court held that the state legislature could not have enacted valid laws defining or regulating the practice of law in any aspect without the state supreme court's approval or acquiescence. The state supreme court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2448(B)(2), which provided that an attorney designated by a testator in his will could only be removed for just cause, was in direct conflict with La. State Bar R. Prof. Conduct, art. XVI, Rule 1.16(a)(3). Rule 1.16 (a)(3) gave a client the absolute right to fire a lawyer in whom he had lost faith or confidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's husband was admitted to the hospital after he sustained multiple stab wounds. The next day, plaintiff's husband died. Approximately 18 months after plaintiff filed her claim with the insurance commissioner, she was notified that the doctor who undertook her husband's treatment was not the hospital's employee, but defendant's employee. Defendant filed an exception of prescription to plaintiff's suit which was maintained by the lower courts. Plaintiff reasonably believed her husband was treated by employees of the hospital. Additionally, the hospital undertook discovery in an effort to defend the claim without denying vicarious responsibility for the physician. Under the circumstances, plaintiff's ignorance of defendant's employment relationship with the doctor, a fact necessary for her to assert her cause of action against defendant, was not willful or inexcusably negligent. The doctrine of contra non valentem applied to suspend the running of prescription until plaintiff was made aware that defendant, and not the hospital, was vicariously responsible for the torts of the emergency room doctor.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to prove second degree murder because the mitigating factors of manslaughter were established. Defendant and the victim were arguing when defendant returned from drinking alcohol. His wife attacked defendant and backed him into the kitchen. The evidence indicated that the cause of death, a skull fracture, was sustained when the couple fell to the kitchen floor. There was no evidence of any other cause. Likewise, there was no evidence that this domestic tragedy was the result of a plan or that defendant had formulated a prior intent to kill his wife. The court held that when the preponderance of the evidence showed that a homicide was committed in sudden passion or heat of blood which would have deprived an average person of his self control and cool reflection, a jury erred in rendering a verdict of second degree murder.</SPAN></P>

Officers found a gun and bloody clothing in the car and later discovered the bodies of two victims who had been shot in the head. Defendant claimed that the other man in the car had ordered him to drive the victims to a remote location, had argued about drugs, and shot the victims in the car. The district court's instruction on the law of principals, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:24, did not clearly point out to the jury that it had to find that defendant had the specific intent to kill to support his first degree murder conviction. The charge could have led a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence to believe he could imply specific intent from the mere fact defendant knew of his co-perpetrator's intent. This relieved the State of its burden of proof on the critical question of state of mind. The instruction was erroneous, but it the error was not harmless. Based on a review of the whole record, the court found a reasonably possibility that the erroneous jury charge may have contributed to defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The candidate asserted that &quot;now serving&quot; meant 1960, the year that language was placed in the constitution, and because the judge was not serving at that time and was over 75, she was disqualified. On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court and dismissed the candidate's suit. The court noted that the &quot;now serving&quot; language had implications as to both pensions and elections, and in both situations, legislation was interpreted liberally against disqualification.

Acts. 938 divesting district courts of original jurisdiction to adjudicate workers' compensation claims and vesting exclusive original jurisdiction in administrative hearing officers violated La. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(A). Plaintiffs, workers and an attorney, had filed the declaratory judgment suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">La. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(A) vested original jurisdiction in district courts over all civil and criminal matters. Initially, the worker's compensation statutory scheme required an employee to initiate a compensation claim by filing a civil suit against an employer in a district court. 1988 La. Acts 938, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1310.5(B) eliminated the district courts in worker's compensation litigation and created administrating hearing officers within the Office of Worker's Compensation Administration to adjudicate the claims. The appeals court found that district courts were constitutionally vested with original jurisdiction over civil matters, including worker's compensation claims, and that the legislature was not constitutionally authorized to take jurisdiction away from the district courts. The court agreed. La. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(A) was explicit as to the district courts' original jurisdiction. There was no authority for the legislature to remove these constitutional restraints on jurisdiction. The term &quot;civil matters,&quot; as used art. V, &sect; 16(A) included claims for worker's compensation. A worker's compensation action was a matter of private, not public, law.</SPAN></P>

Consequently, when the officers stopped the hunters for questioning, learned that they had ducks in the ice chest that had been taken the day before, and discovered ducks without tags, in violation of 50 C.F.R. &sect; 20.36, they were aware of facts that would give a reasonable officer probable cause to believe that the hunters had violated the regulation. Even if some right had been violated, the game agents were entitled to qualified immunity. The court also found that the game agents' act of leaving a negative note for a hunter to find did not lead to liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress because the actions were negligent, not outrageous or intentional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with aggravated burglary of an inhabited dwelling while armed with a gun in violation of La.

Nearly four years later, a panel of doctors was convened and recommended that defendant be conditionally discharged. The district court ordered recommitment based on its finding that defendant was a danger to others as defined under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28:2(3). Defendant did not meet his burden to prove he was not a danger to others under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 657. The district court's finding was not an abuse of discretion based on evidence that defendant remained combative, agitated, and psychotic at the facility and had repeatedly been in altercations with other patients. The dangerousness test of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 654-57 did not violate due process or equal protection, even though civil commitment and release procedures were different. The State had a substantial interest in avoiding premature release of insanity acquittees who had committed felonies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimants brought a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) in a medical malpractice case where defendant doctors, their medical corporation, and its insurer settled and paid $ 100,000 to the claimants, thus invoking the excess liability provisions of intervenor, the Patient's Compensation Fund, which was created by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 40:1299.44.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants sued the doctors, alleging that the claimant wife had been treated for sinus problems with substandard medical care, which caused her to suffer residual brain damage and susceptibility to seizures. The parties agreed to settle. The claimants filed an amended petition seeking judicial approval and added the medical corporation, the malpractice insurer, the State, and the Patient's Compensation Fund as parties. The trial court approved the settlement, noting that the issue of damages due from the Fund would be addressed later. The Fund answered, denying negligence and asserting its right to litigate liability before a jury. The trial court held that the settlement constituted an admission of liability. The court of appeal reversed, and the claimants appealed. The court held that the Fund had a right to a jury trial. However, the court concluded that where one qualified health care provider or its insurer had paid $ 100,000 to a medical malpractice victim, the admission of liability provision was triggered, and only the amount of the victim's damages in excess of the amount already paid was in issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeal insofar as it recognized the Fund's right to litigate the issue of liability. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court found that the blood results were inadmissible because the procedures were defective and did not comply with known guidelines. The court found that compliance with regulations insuring the integrity and reliability of the blood alcohol test did not have not be shown because the State did not rely on the statutory presumption of intoxication under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:662A(1)(c) to prove defendant's blood alcohol level. The only requirement was that the reliability of the blood alcohol test satisfied due process and fairness.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.41 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Patients sought damages caused by the negligence of physicians, and in one case of a blood center. The court of appeal had affirmed trial court judgments dismissing the claims because they had not been reviewed by a medical panel as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.47. The court reversed and remanded. The patients were not required to submit their claims against the physicians and blood center to a medical review panel because the physicians and blood center were not enrolled in the Patient Compensation Fund when they committed their acts of alleged malpractice. The fact that the physicians and blood center was qualified health care providers (QHCPs) under the Act before the patients filed suit, and obtained &quot;claims made&quot; insurance covering the patients' claims, did not operate retroactively to require the patients to submit their claims for review as though the physicians and blood center had been QHCPs when the malpractice occurred. Retroactive qualification could expose the fund to liability for period during which it did not receive surcharge payments from the physicians and blood center, and might violate the patients' equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, parish and state officials, appealed a judgment from the Twenty-Fifth Judicial District Court, Parish of Plaquemines (Louisiana) that issued a preliminary injunction and ordered defendants to return plaintiff bar owner's occupational and alcoholic beverage licenses, revoked under Plaquemines Parish, La. Ordinances 4-14, 4-26, pending a hearing. The ordinances violated due process because the licenses were revoked without a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants suspended the bar owner's alcoholic beverage permit, seized her occupational license, and ordered her to cease operations without notice of a hearing. Defendants claimed that immediate suspension of the bar owner's licenses was justified under Plaquemines Parish, La. Ordinances 4-14, 4-26 and state law because she served minors and intoxicated persons at the bar. Defendants also alleged that a minor was killed in a car accident after being served at the bar. The bar owner filed suit, even though was told she could appear at the next scheduled parish council meeting to be held six days later. The court agreed that the ordinances violated the bar owners' due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The sale of alcoholic beverages was a lawful business. The bar owner's property and liberty interests could not be infringed without proper notice and a hearing. Laws promulgated pursuant to the state's police power that regulated the sale of alcoholic beverages still had to meet constitutional due process requirements. The trial court correctly held that the ordinances were unconstitutional and that the bar owner was deprived due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of defrauding medicaid through various billing schemes. The court reversed the convictions of one defendant on charges that he billed for visits to patients at a nursing home that were never made. The evidence that the visits were never made was unreliable because it consisted of incomplete and deficient nursing home records, and there was insufficient evidence apart from those documents to support convictions on those charges. However, the convictions of each defendant on all the other charges were affirmed. It was not error to admit evidence of defendants' billing improprieties and crimes with non-medicaid patients because defendants' intent was a contested issue, that evidence showed the intent behind their medicaid billing practices, and the value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial impact, which was ameliorated by a cautionary instruction to the jury. There was ample evidence from which the jury could find the specific intent required for a conviction. The court rejected as moot the State's claim that the court of appeal should not have proportionately reduced costs assessed against defendants for the counts that were reversed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of one defendant was reversed as to counts based on alleged fraudulent billings for services rendered to patients at a nursing home, and the remainder of the judgment as to that defendant, and the entire judgment as to the other defendant, were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the original hearing, the court concluded that the Legislature could, pursuant to La. Const. art.

Ann. &sect; 42:1132. However the court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1511.5 violated the separation of powers provision of La. Const. art. II, &sect; 2 by vesting the Committee with the authority to exercise the exclusive executive function of enforcing the campaign finance disclosure laws by filing suit. On rehearing, the court found that &sect; 18:1511.5 did not violate La. Const. art. II, &sect; 2, thus reversed the appellate court. The court noted that the members of the Committee, classified as civil servants, appointed for staggered six-year terms, and removable only for cause, were not subject to significant legislative control after their appointment. The court thus found that the Legislature could not be deemed to be performing executive functions in violation of art. II, &sect; 2 by controlling members of the Committee.</SPAN></P>

V, &sect; 5(D), from a judgment of the Juvenile Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss a petition charging him with entering or remaining in a place after being forbidden to do so, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:63.3, and declared &sect; 14:63.3&nbsp;unconstitutional due to vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 15-year-old juvenile, was warned not to return to a store after a shoplifting dispute. When she later returned weeks later, she was arrested and charged with violation of &sect; 14:63.3, despite not having first been told to leave on that occasion. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment dismissing the charge, but reversed the holding that &sect; 14:63.3 was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that an element of &sect; 14:63.3 was the issuance of a reasonably contemporaneous request to leave, which was lacking in defendant's case. The court noted that neither side made the constitutional argument, and it found that the juvenile court erred in its declaration. The court found that &sect; 14:63.3 was clearly worded and gave adequate notice to a person of average intelligence as to the type of conduct proscribed. Thus, the statute satisfied U.S. Const. amend. XIV and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

The owner challenged the judgment of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal (Louisiana) that affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment to the contractor and held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2772 barred all actions in contract and tort after 10 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner had suffered damage to its property after a grain storage tank built by the contractor had ruptured more than 10 years following the tank's construction. The court held that (1) there was a duty of disclosure placed upon a contractor who acquired knowledge of a hazard that arose from the ordinary usage of its construction and that created a danger of personal injury or property damage. In failing to disclose information which a contractor in good faith was bound to reveal, a contractor who did not disclose was guilty of bad faith; and (2) the cause of action for damages that resulted from the breach of that duty was not perempted by application of &sect; 9:2772 because the allegation in the petition that charged the contractor with knowledge and failure to warn the owner of a hazardous condition asserted a claim based in fraud. Thus, the claim fell within the exception to the 10 year peremptive period set out in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2772(H). The owner's petition raised disputed questions of fact concerning whether the contractor was guilty of misconduct and whether its inaction kept the owner ignorant of a known danger in the tank's construction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The father brought a wrongful death action stemming from his wife's death and a personal injury action as a result of his son's injuries. A jury verdict held against the father in the wrongful death action. The father later settled the personal injury action, but further sought to challenge the constitutionality of the recovery limitation set forth in the Louisiana Medical Malpractice Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.41 et seq. The two lower courts pretermitted discussion of the constitutional issues, finding there was a settlement between the father and defendants. The father sought further review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that under the clear terms of the Medical Malpractice Act, the doctor was statutorily released from any further liability when the father accepted the policy limits that he and his insurer deposited into the registry of the court. The court ruled that there was strong evidence suggesting the father realized he was settling with the doctor and that he intended to do so.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:301(3)(a) against plaintiff taxpayer on freight charges for goods delivered from an out-of-state vendor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a Louisiana construction company, purchased stone from an out-of-state vendor. An independent company was paid by the vendor to transport the stone to the taxpayer. The taxpayer was billed separately by the vendor for the stone and the freight. The Department assessed a use tax on the freight charges under &sect; 47:301(3)(a). The district and appellate courts found that &sect; 47:301(3)(a) violated the Commerce Clause. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that &sect; 47:301(3)(a) had been previously found unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, and had not been amended. The court held that the constitutional defect could not be altered by the Department's regulations, which in any event did not apply because the vendor did not perform or arrange the transportation. The court ruled that &sect; 47:301(3)(a) remained unconstitutional because there was no parallel assessment of sales taxes on freight within the state, thus it discriminated between in-state and out-of-state sales.</SPAN></P>

Although the court concluded that the trial court did not manifestly err in finding that the company failed to establish an unconstitutional confiscation, the court held that injunctive relief was still appropriate if the company made a showing of irreparable injury. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court with directions to render a judgment granting a preliminary injunction to the company. The court found that the company would suffer irreparable injury absent the injunction inasmuch as the prohibition against retroactive rate making precluded the trial court from awarding the company complete relief in the event of success on the merits. The court also found a reasonable possibility that the company would prevail on the merits of the rate case. Further, the court found no disservice of the public interest or risk of injury to the company's customers who were adequately protected by the right to a refund and the security to be furnished for the injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city sought review of a summary judgment from the Civil District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which allowed plaintiff national bank to recover the full amount of ad valorem taxes paid under protest with interest thereon at the rate of 15 percent. The judgment also held that the bank share tax statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city assessed the tax against the shares of stock of the bank pursuant to &sect; 47:1967. The bank claimed that the tax was invalid because it did not provide a deduction for tax-exempt federal securities as required by 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 742. The parties entered into an agreement in which they agreed to follow the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in two pending cases. The first decision held that federal obligations should not be considered in computation of a state bank share tax. The second decision held that a proportionate deduction of federal securities was all that was constitutionally or statutorily required. The court reversed the judgment and remanded to the trial court for a determination of the correct amount of the refund. The court held that the trial court erred in concluding that under the parties' agreement the bank was only bound by the initial decision and not by the complete, final decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. The court also held that the two percent interest rate under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2110(A) applied to the refund.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, school board and individuals, sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeal, First Circuit (Louisiana), which reversed the decision of the trial court and ordered the trial court to grant the injunctive relief sought by defendants against plaintiffs, teachers and school personnel, holding that the Little Norris-LaGuardia Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:821-24, 841-49, did not protect public employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, teachers and school personnel went on strike and began to picket defendants', school board and individuals, property. Defendants refused to recognize the employees' union and not engage in collective bargaining. Plaintiffs filed a class action seeking monetary damages and an injunction prohibiting defendants from firing any of the striking employees. The district court ordered mediation. The appellate court reversed and ordered the trial court to grant the injunctive relief sought by defendants, holding that public employees were not protected under the Little Norris-LaGuardia Act (Act), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:821-24, 841-49. The court reversed and held that Louisiana public policy favored the organization of and collective bargaining for both public and private employees. Concomitant with those protected rights was the right to engage in peaceful picketing, work stoppage, and other concerted activities. Thus, the Act was applicable to plaintiffs, who were public school employees. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:822 showed a clear legislative intent to protect all employees in the exercise of their right to engage in concerted activities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the appellate court in favor of defendants, school board and individuals, and against plaintiffs, teachers and school personnel, because the Little Norris-LaGuardia Act was applicable to plaintiffs, thus allowing them to engage in peaceful picketing, work stoppage, and other concerted activities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the denial of his suppression motion arguing that a traffic stop for following too closely, which lead to the discovery of marijuana that was ultimately delivered to defendant, was illegal because it was a pretext for a drug interdiction patrol, thereby tainting the driver's consent to search the car. The court affirmed, holding that the statute relied upon for the traffic stop, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:81(A), was not unconstitutionally vague, therefore any subjective underlying motive was irrelevant because the officer had probable cause to stop the car. Although the officer admitted he did not tell the driver she and her passenger could go after he issued the warning citation, he insisted he told them they could refuse to consent to the search. Thus, the search was lawful pursuant to the driver's written consent, and the marijuana found in the trunk was lawfully seized.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction and denial of motion to suppress were affirmed. Following too closely statute was not unconstitutionally vague, therefore traffic stop was valid, not a pretext, giving officer probable cause to stop vehicle; driver's written consent to search the vehicle was also valid.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff workers' compensation carrier for the employer signed a contract with defendant for the employee's ongoing care.

The court found that the administrative law judge did not have the power to determine the constitutionality of the fee schedule as applied to the validity of the contract. The legislature had not specifically granted the workers' compensation court the power to nullify the contract because of an alleged violation of the fee schedule, nor had it given the administrative court the power to award reimbursement.

Defendant argued that his initial arrest for refusal to leave the public sidewalk of a nightclub was illegal, and thus, he was never in the lawful custody of police, requisite to a charge of simple escape. Defendant also claimed that the evidence at trial was insufficient to convict him of the narcotics violation. The court first held that defendant violated state law, not by refusing to leave the sidewalk, but by attempting to enter the nightclub; thus, his arrest was justified and his conviction for simple escape was proper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contended that the trial court erred in denying their motions for new hearings concerning the constitutionality of the prescriptive/peremptive statute applicable to legal malpractice actions embodied in La.

The court found that the statute changed the prescriptive periods for all legal malpractice claims to one year from the date of the act, or its discovery, within a three-year peremptive period. The statute was controlling in any malpractice claim with no distinction between a claim in contract or one in tort. The law applied in legal malpractice was based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duty. The trial court considered the claims and found them to stem from the failure to disclose, which sounded in negligence rather than fraud.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following her conviction for possession of drugs, appellant challenged the denial by the Twenty-ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Charles (Louisiana) of her motion to suppress evidence found in her home which was denied prior to her trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to her conviction for drug possession, appellant was denied her motion to suppress evidence seized from her home under a warrant executed at night, but not authorized on its face for nighttime execution. Subsequent to her conviction, appellant filed the current appeal, alleging that since the warrant did not explicitly authorize a nighttime search, the execution was unconstitutional. The court found the judge who signed the warrant knew the warrant would be served at night and the officer's conduct was reasonable, so appellant could not show that failure to adhere to technical requirements would have influenced the judge's decision to sign the warrant. Consequently, the warrant execution was valid under the good faith exception. On its sua sponte error patent review, the court affirmed entry of appellant's guilty plea because she knew of the consequences of her plea despite the court's failure to properly inform appellant of the consequences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction, finding that because the signing judge to the warrant knew the information omitted from the warrant, the error barely invoked constitutional scrutiny and was executed under the good faith exception to strict compliance with facial instructions on a warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for second-degree murder arguing that the introduction of two incriminating statements he made while in police detention and while awaiting trial was erroneous and that he would not have been convicted and sentenced to life had they been excluded. The court found defendant's statement to police inadmissible because it was taken after defendant requested an attorney, and it was not clear that a subsequent alleged waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. However, the error was harmless because there was ample testimony of defendant's guilt to convict him even without his statement. The court also found defendant's statement to an investigator while awaiting trial inadmissible because of confusion about whom was representing defendant when the statement was given. That too was harmless error, however, because of overwhelming direct uncontroverted eyewitness evidence against defendant. Defendant made several other assignments of error, which the court similarly found meritless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a convicted criminal inmate, filed a civil suit against all possible parties connected with his prosecution, seeking to have his sentence commuted to 20 years and seeking damages.

Defendant defense attorney filed an exception of prescription, contending that the matter was governed by the peremptive period for legal malpractice claims found in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5605. The trial court granted the exceptions in favor of defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment sustaining the exceptions. The court reasoned that plaintiff failed to allege facts showing that defendant judge acted with malice and corruption, thus plaintiff did not state a cause of action under either state or federal law.

The court found that mandatory minimum sentences under the Louisiana Habitual Offender Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, were constitutional. Defendant failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that he was an exceptional defendant who, because of unusual circumstances, was a victim of the legislature's failure to assign sentences that were meaningfully tailored to the offender's culpability, the gravity of the offense, and the circumstances of the case. Therefore, the court found that defendant's sentence was not constitutionally excessive. The court also directed the district court to correct and file the minutes of defendant's sentencing proceeding to reflect the accurate sentence of 24.75 rather than 24.76 years.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was properly identified as the person convicted of a prior rape, there was no constitutional infirmity in the record of his guilty plea to a prior crime, and the trial court's conclusion about defendant's propensity to commit crimes was supported by his numerous prior convictions and arrests.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted of armed robbery, appealed his conviction, alleging that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction; the trial court erred by preventing the trial from being fully open to the public; by not allowing defendant and another witness to testify before the defense had formally rested; and by imposing an unconstitutionally harsh and excessive sentence. The court held that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support defendant's conviction. Furthermore, defendant was afforded a public trial as he was allowed the opportunity to admit anyone he deemed necessary for trial. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by not allowing defendant to re-open his case after resting where defendant had been afforded adequate time to decide if he wished to testify. Finally, the trial court did not impose an excessive sentence. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed judgment of Thirtieth Judicial District Court, Parish of Vernon (Louisiana), which sentenced her to five years at hard labor after she pled guilty to possessing cocaine. Defendant's attorney filed an Anders brief claiming there were no meritorious grounds for appeal and motioned to withdraw as counsel of record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not inform defendant that the offense to which she pled could enhance the penalty for subsequent offenses she may commit and did not inform her of the possible penalties for future offenses. This error was harmless because the requirement was statutory and defendant did not claim any prejudice. Although counsel could have argued in her Anders brief that the trial court did not discuss all the sentencing factors of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, the record showed an adequate factual basis for the sentence imposed and remand was unnecessary. The trial court documents did not reveal any patent statutory or constitutional errors requiring reversal of defendant's conviction. Defendant's sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive in light of the facts that defendant benefitted from the plea bargain reached and that she committed the crime while on parole for another offense and on bail for another arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction affirmed and defense attorney's motion to withdraw granted because counsel's Anders brief was adequate and record clearly showed adequate factual basis for sentence imposed, review of trial court documents did not reveal any patent statutory or constitutional errors, and sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence would have made no measurable contribution to the acceptable goals of punishment. The suspended sentence was therefore affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police stopped defendant for a traffic violation and discovered that the vehicle he was driving was reported stolen.

Defendant argued the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the identification and the evidence. The court found that even assuming that the identification procedure was suggestive, it was reliable because the victim had an excellent opportunity to view defendant. With regard to the evidence, the court found that as both the knife and the T-shirt would have been discovered pursuant to a search with a warrant, both items were admissible under the &quot;inevitable discovery doctrine.&quot; Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in adjudicating him a third-felony habitual offender, because the State failed to prove that the cleansing period for one of his predicate convictions had not elapsed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his suit to execute a judgment by seizing appellee judgment debtor's interest in a trust, appellant judgment creditor challenged denial of his right to attach those assets under superseded statutes which mentioned the right to seize trust property based on &quot;torts.&quot; Appellant argued the current version of the statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2005(3), allowing recovery for &quot;offenses and quasi-offenses,&quot; should have been applied and his claim was for an offense based on breach of fiduciary duty. The court found the current statute was remedial as applied and did not alter the award under the original judgment, so it was retroactive. The court found the basis of appellant's judgment was in some respects &quot;offenses&quot; subject to the 10 year prescription period under La. Civ.

Defendant argued, inter alia, that the record was incomplete because the transcripts of most pre-trial hearings were missing. The court found that, because defendant demonstrated no prejudice resulting from the absence in the record of transcripts that presumably existed at one time, this assignment of error was without merit. The court also found no error in the jury instructions given, because defendant failed to note any objections on the record. Next, the court found that evidence of a single instance of sexual intercourse between the victim and another individual five days prior to the rape was not relevant to a determination of whether the act with defendant was consensual.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was convicted of possession with intent to distribute narcotics. On appeal, defendant asserted the trial judge erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized at the time of his arrest. The court found the arresting officer articulated a reasonable basis for fear of his safety and was justified in conducting a limited search of defendant's outer clothing based on the potential for defendant to be carrying a knife and other circumstances. The seizure of the drugs discovered in the pat-down search was not unconstitutional since they were voluntarily exhibited by defendant. The court amended the minute entry and commitment to conform to the sentence imposed by the trial judge on count two because there was a discrepancy between the minutes and the transcript.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the 24th Judicial District Court Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), defendant challenged his conviction on, among others, the ground that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95E was unconstitutional as applied to one convicted of a misdemeanor charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95E discriminated against him, a misdemeanor drug offender who exercised his constitutional right to own a weapon, by depriving him of his constitutional right to bear arms. He reasoned that there was no rational relationship between the provision's broad scope and its legislative purpose of preventing drug-related crimes of violence. Judgment of conviction and sentence was affirmed. The court held that the statute at issue, even as applied to one in possession of a misdemeanor amount of marijuana, served the legitimate state purpose of protecting law enforcement officers and the public from those who might commit a violent act with a weapon while under the influence of drugs. Accordingly, the court found no merit to defendant's allegation that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95E was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions of two counts of oral sexual battery and one count of aggravated incest, asserting among other points of error, that he was denied the right of confrontation and the right to present a defense based on the trial court's refusal to permit the defendant to question the victim or other witnesses about the victim's prior sexual behavior; and refusal to allow evidence on the victim's prior sexual activity. The court held that defendant failed to comply with La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 412 for raising the issue of prior sexual activity on the part of the victim of a sexually assaultive crime; and that his purpose for introducing the evidence, as general evidence relating to the victim's past sexual behavior, was prohibited.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was arrested for driving while intoxicated. Defendant suspended plaintiff's driver's license. Plaintiff requested an administrative hearing.

There was no live testimony by the arresting officer. Plaintiff objected to the introduction of the affidavit arguing that it was inadmissible hearsay. The administrative law judge overruled plaintiff's objection and upheld the suspension. Plaintiff petitioned for judicial review. The trial court found in favor of plaintiff concluding that the hearsay evidence was incompetent evidence, which standing alone, was insufficient to support administrative findings. Defendant appealed. The court reversed, concluding that statutory authority existed for the use of hearsay evidence at the suspension hearing and that such evidence, depending upon its individual character, may be considered competent evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no manifest error in respondent's determination that petitioner had a prior conviction for aggravated assault, because documentary evidence adequately supported the factual finding that petitioner was sentenced and released on parole for another crime in another state.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:1177(A)(9), 15:571.3. The application of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:571.3(D) did not violate the ex post facto clauses of the federal or state constitutions, U.S. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the trial court, sentencing him to fifteen years at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence as a result of defendant's guilty plea to charges of vehicular homicide.

The court found the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant. The court reasoned that defendant had previously been convicted of driving while intoxicated and, on the night of the accident at issue, had a blood alcohol level twice of that necessary to fall within the vehicular homicide statute. Also a factor in sentencing was the fact that, immediately prior to the accident, defendant had been involved in an initial accident and then fled the scene at a high rate of speed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his sentence for driving while intoxicated (third offense) received in the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier (Louisiana).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his sentence for driving while intoxicated (DWI) as being unconstitutionally excessive. The court held that, for appellant's sentence to be unconstitutionally excessive, it would have had to have been grossly out of proportion to the seriousness of the offense or nothing more than a purposeless and needless infliction of pain and suffering. The sentence would have had to shock the sense of justice. The court found that the lower court reviewed defendant's criminal record before imposing the sentence. Appellant had prior DWI convictions in 1986, 1992, and 1993. He also had a 1993 conviction for distribution of cocaine. He had been on probation three times for DWI but obviously had not learned to control his drinking. The court concluded that appellant's record indicated that a lesser sentence would deprecate the seriousness of the offense and put a dangerous criminal back on the streets. The court affirmed appellant's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's sentence. Appellant's prior convictions for driving while intoxicated, distribution of cocaine, plus his reckless conduct of driving on the interstate while intoxicated, indicated that probation was ineffective for appellant. The sentence was therefore not unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant failed to move for reconsideration of his enhanced sentence as a habitual offender following his plea of no contest to attempted, aggravated rape and aggravated burglary, but, despite that, defendant appealed the sentence as excessive. The court found since defendant failed to move for reconsideration, he was barred from attacking, on any grounds, his sentence on appeal. The court also found that the facts of the case, combined with defendant's personal and criminal histories, and the lower court's imposition of the minimum sentence for defendant's crimes, demonstrated that the sentence imposed was not illegal or grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crimes. Consequently, defendant failed to carry his burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence he was a victim of the legislature's failure to assign sentences that were meaningfully tailored to the culpability of the offender and the gravity of the offense given the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, finding that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to prove that defendant distributed the cocaine and for a rational trier of fact to conclude that he intended to distribute the cocaine as that term was defined by the statutes and case law. The trier of fact properly concluded that the defense of entrapment was not established because the evidence showed defendant was predisposed to sell drugs, evinced a willingness to provide the drugs, and had an available supplier.

Defendant contended that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he and the victim engaged in sexual intercourse and that the sentences were excessive. The court vacated count four due to the fact that the crime charged took place in another parish. The remaining convictions were affirmed. According to the court, the record revealed sufficient corroborating evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that sexual intercourse between the defendant and victim had occurred.

The court concluded that a privilege, such as an employee gaming permit, could be limited by subsequent legislation. Since &sect; 27:76 specifically included within its specified criteria for disqualification from the privilege of holding an employee gaming permit &quot;a plea of guilty&quot; and plaintiff had entered a plea of guilty, plaintiff was disqualified from the privilege of an award of a gaming employee permit.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42 A(4). The court affirmed, holding that evidence, including medical testimony and the victim's identification of defendant, was sufficient to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Admission of medical testimony relating to the victim's statement to the doctor was proper under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 803(4). Minimal evidence of possible coaching and victim's age were insufficient to exclude her statement, and admission of that statement, without her testimony at trial, did not violate defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend VI and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The victim's failed attempts to testify did not prejudice defendant because admonishments were sufficient to overcome any potential prejudice arising from sympathy or passion.

The trial court held plaintiff failed to prove defendants knew or should have known of the risk of injury from the object on the river floor. Plaintiff appealed. The court held plaintiff's negligence action was properly dismissed since the statute rendering defendant state potentially liable was declared unconstitutional. Plaintiff's strict liability claim was properly dismissed since plaintiff did not prove that either the river or the defective object on the riverbed which caused him harm was in the care or custody of defendants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for attempted armed robbery, aggravated battery, and illegal use of a weapon after his co-perpetrator testified against him. He was sentenced to 49 years at hard labor for the aggravated robbery and 10 years at hard labor for the shootings. On appeal of the convictions and sentences, the court affirmed. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request at trial to withdraw his court-appointed counsel and allow defendant to retain a private lawyer. Defendant had had four months to inform the court he intended to retain private counsel, and he had not done so. Defendant's sentences were not constitutionally excessive because defendant committed his crimes while on probation and shot one victim without provocation while the victim was trying to escape. The court ordered amendment of the commitment form regarding defendant's eligibility for parole.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner state government sought review by the state supreme court. On further review, the supreme court vacated the sentence and remanded for another sentencing hearing noting that (a) criminal defendants must clearly and convincingly prove that the minimum statutory sentence is unduly harsh under the circumstances; (b) sentencing court, before imposing a sentence below the statutory minimum, must identify the particular factors which led to its conclusion that the minimum was unduly harsh; (c) sentencing court here failed to do that, instead relying generally on respondent's rehabilitation and the lack of any physical injury to anyone (factors the sentencing statutes already take into account); and (d) consequently sentencing court's decision was invalid, with remand for another sentencing hearing required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were awarded a judgment against defendant school board. The board's superintendent transferred funds from the general liability fund to another fund leaving the board with insufficient funds to pay tort claimants. The trial court issued an injunction, ordering defendant to formally ratify or reject the transfer and awarded plaintiffs costs. Defendant appealed, and plaintiffs requested that the injunction be amended. The appellate court affirmed the injunction and award of costs and did not amend the injunction. The trial court did not err in finding that the superintendent failed to report the transfer of funds and affirmed the injunction and award of costs in this matter. As to plaintiffs' request, defendant's payment policy for legal claims did not violate plaintiffs' equal protection rights because plaintiffs did not fall into a suspect category and no fundamental right was involved, and since the policy had a reasonable basis rationally related to a legitimate interest, it was valid. Defendant's payment policy also did not violate the Louisiana Local Government Budget Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:1301, et seq. and school board budgetary policies and regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant wood company violated the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:4278.2(E), which mandated that the buyer's failure to comply with its statutory provisions shall be prima facie evidence of the buyer's intent to commit theft of timber. The court construed La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:4278.2 to be a prohibitory statute. Based upon the defendant wood company's failure to comply with this prohibitory statute, the court found upon reconsideration, that the trial court properly granted a permanent injunction. In their application for rehearing, plaintiffs correctly noted that the expert testimony in the record was presented by them, not the defendant wood company. In light of the court's decision on rehearing, this was not significant to the resolution of this case. The only relief sought by plaintiffs in their original and amended petitions was a declaratory judgment that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:4278.2 was unconstitutional and for injunctive relief. The court ruled that the trial court properly issued a permanent injunction and a remand was not necessary.</SPAN></P>

Defendant adopted a sales and use tax which the voters approved. Defendant later adopted a resolution which sought to amend the tax in order to repeal certain exemptions for hotels.

A decision suspending collection of the tax was reaffirmed. The proposition approved by voters clearly exempted hotel room occupancy from the tax. Mandamus was not appropriate until the factual and legal questions were answered. The issue whether the tax was valid had to be decided by a declaratory judgment. Dismissal of the intervenors was reversed because (1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (2) the interests it sought to protect were germane to the organization's purpose; and (3) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested required the participation in the lawsuit of each of the individual members.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) convicting defendant of distribution of crack cocaine, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(A)(1), and distribution of marijuana, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(A)(1). Defendant also appealed his sentence under the Habitual Offender Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers had conducted a &quot;buy/bust&quot; narcotics operation. Defendant was arrested after the &quot;buy.&quot; Defendant's convictions for distribution of crack cocaine and marijuana were affirmed. Sufficient evidence supported both convictions. Testimony indicated that defendant stopped an officer, talked with the officer, and then approached the officer with marijuana. Defendant eagerly obtained cocaine for the officer, shaking his hand and introducing himself to the officer. Defendant's enhanced sentence under the Habitual Offender Law was also affirmed. While one of defendant's prior convictions was for possession of cocaine, another was for distribution of false drugs. His third felony conviction was for distribution of cocaine, and he was convicted for that offense along with being convicted for distribution of marijuana. Of defendant's four drug convictions, three were for distribution. Defendant either sold drugs for other persons, or other persons held his drugs and money for him. While defendant had one prior conviction for possession of cocaine, the record contained nothing from which it could be concluded that defendant was an addict selling drugs to support his habit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court affirmed defendant's convictions as well as his enhanced sentenced. Evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant distributed-delivered by physically transferring possession-marijuana and cocaine, defendant was not entrapped, defendant was not an addicted drug offender, and the sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Morehouse, Louisiana, which convicted defendant of aggravated incest in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of convicted of aggravated incest and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. The victim of his offense was his stepdaughter, who was under 18 years of age at the time of the abuse. A substantial portion of the evidence at trial consisted of the testimony of the victim. The victim's brother also testified that he had observed defendant engaging in sexual contact with the victim. Defendant argued on appeal that the conviction was based on insufficient evidence and that his sentence was excessive. Defendant's conviction was affirmed after the court viewed the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, because it found the jury could have reasonably concluded that defendant engaged in all the necessary elements of the offense of aggravated incest as specified in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:78.1. The court noted that the victim's testimony alone, which was found to be credible by the trier of fact, was sufficient support for the conviction because there was no internal contradiction or conflicting physical evidence. The sentence was affirmed because it was not constitutionally excessive and because the record adequately supported it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for aggravated incest was affirmed because the evidence had been sufficient for the jury to determine that defendant had engaged in sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter. Defendant's sentence was affirmed because it was adequately supported by the record, because the trial court had not abused its discretion, and because it was not constitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and convicted of attempted manslaughter, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:27, 31. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that sufficient evidence supported the conviction because a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime in witnesses' testimony. Further, defendant failed to prove that police conducted a poor investigation of the crime. The trial court did not err in limiting cross-examination of prosecution's witness to determine bias, prejudice, interest, or corruption, because both prosecution and defendant explored the witness's felony record, and the evidence did not support the suggestion that the witness would gain something from testifying against defendant. Defendant's sentence was not excessive because defendant failed to prove that less than the mandatory minimum sentence was warranted, and because defendant had a record of violent criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment convicting defendant of attempted manslaughter was affirmed, because witnesses' testimony provided sufficient evidence to support the conviction, defendant was properly limited to cross-examining prosecution's witness to determine bias, prejudice, interest, or corruption, and defendant's sentence was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, while only showing a gun in his belt, robbed a young man of his shoes and beeper. Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to 30 years at hard labor.

On appeal the court found that the evidence offered at trial was sufficient to convict the defendant for armed robbery. When considering the sentence, the court noted that defense counsel had not properly preserved for appeal the issue of excessiveness of sentence; therefore, the issue was waived. However, the court also found that the lack of any presentence report provided by the court combined with the defense counsel's failure to preserve the issue on appeal properly rendered his assistance to the defendant ineffective.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient appealed a judgment from the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana) that granted defendant hospital's exception of prescription in a strict liability action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient sued defendant hospital after he was diagnosed with Hepatitis C virus that resulted from blood transfusions at defendant hospital 13 years prior. Defendant filed an exception of prescription; the lower court granted it. Plaintiff appealed and the court reversed and remanded the matter. The court held that plaintiff's claim of receiving defective blood was a strict liability action. Therefore, the general one year prescription under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3492 applied and did not commence until after plaintiff knew or should have known of the damage. Therefore, because plaintiff filed suit within one year of being diagnosed his action was timely. The court held that plaintiff's cause of action in strict tort products liability was a vested property rights protected by due process and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5629, which was enacted after the acquisition of such vested property right, could not be retroactively applied so as to divest plaintiff of his vested right. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628 was inapplicable to strict tort products liability actions arising out of a defective blood sale as the condition was unreasonably dangerous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the granting of defendant hospital's exception of prescription and remanded the matter because the applicable statute of limitation was one for a strict liability action, and not the one for a medical malpractice suit. Therefore, the action was timely filed within one year of plaintiff knowing of his injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant surviving spouse sought review of a judgment from the 24th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which granted daughters' request to annul a probated will and reopen the succession of estate pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. art. 96, because the will was not properly witnessed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment and denied daughters' petition to annul probated testament and reopen the succession of estate pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. art. 96. Decedent's will left her estate to her surviving spouse. Daughters joined in petition to probate the will and signed an affidavit stating that their legitimate share had been satisfied by non-probate assets. Later, the daughters filed the petition, claiming the will was not properly notarized. The will was notarized in the hospital and two witnesses watched decedent sign the will. Upon discovering that one of the witnesses was illiterate, the notary had a nurse add her signature without having the decedent resign the will. The court held that art. 96 allowed for the reopening of succession if new property was discovered, or for any other proper cause. The court examined the caselaw that interpreted the phrase &quot;any other proper cause&quot; and found it should have been applied only in the most extreme situations. The court held that this was not the situation and that the decedent's estate would not be reopened. The court vacated the judgment below and reinstated the original judgment of possession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that granted the petition to annul the probated will, and held that the failure of the notary to have the testator sign the will again in front of the new witness was not a proper cause for reopening the estate. The court ordered the original judgment of possession reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from the 40th Judicial District Court of the Parish of St. John the Baptist (Louisiana), which awarded plaintiffs damages for conversion of personal property. Plaintiffs also appealed from a prior order granting summary judgment to defendants as to the legality of the seizure of plaintiffs' mobile home and defendants sheriff and insurer appealed from the award of damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' mobile home was seized by legal process, which was executed by defendant sheriff at the direction of defendant lender. Certain contents of the home were damaged during the seizure and plaintiffs initiated litigation against various defendants. A prior ruling of the court had dismissed certain defendants on a motion for summary judgment as to the legality of the seizure. The trial court then awarded damages to plaintiffs for loss of the contents of their home against defendant lender, its insurer, and defendant sheriff. Plaintiffs appealed the adequacy of the damage award and defendants appealed as to liability. The court affirmed the judgment as entered. Plaintiffs could not appeal the earlier summary judgment order because that order was final and appealable when it was entered. Plaintiffs were entitled to damages for conversion of their personal property although the seizure of the mobile home was proper. Defendant sheriff and defendant lender's general liability insurer was liable because neither the sheriff nor lender gave prior notice of the seizure. The partial reduction of the damage award was affirmed because plaintiffs failed to mitigate their damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed as untimely plaintiffs' appeal of the prior summary judgment order because that order was final and appealable when it was entered. The award of damages for conversion of plaintiffs' personal property was affirmed because neither defendant gave plaintiffs prior notice of the seizure, but plaintiffs were not entitled to the full measure of damages because they were partially negligent in failing to mitigate their damages.</SPAN></P>

Defendant brought an exception of prescription, which the trial court denied on grounds that application of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.47(A)(2)(a) as amended constituted an improper retroactive application of a substantive change in the law. On appeal, the court affirmed. Before enactment of the amendment, prescription was suspended by filing a claim, even if not filed in the proper place. Retroactive application of the amended statute deprived plaintiff of her substantive right to raise her cause of action against defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Twenty-Second Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Tammany (Louisiana), judgment of conviction upon a jury verdict for two counts of promotion of obscene devices, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106.1, and denial of defendant's motion to quash the statute as unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106.1, which prohibited the sale of obscene items, was unconstitutional. The court reversed the convictions under the statute and ordered her discharge. The prohibition of the sale and promotion of devices that were designed for genital stimulation was supported by the state's police powers justification of protecting children and nonconsenting adults from being exposed to the devices. The statute clearly accomplished these goals by simply forbidding sale or promotion for sale, but it swept too broadly. As applied to a commercial vendor such as the defendant, the owner of a retail establishment, this statute unconstitutionally exceeded the limits of the state's legitimate interest and authority. There was no real and substantial relationship between the regulation imposed and the prevention of injury to the public or the promotion of the general welfare. The remaining arguments were not reached because it was not necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the convictions and sentences, finding that the district court erred in denial of the defendant's motion to quash, because the statute was unconstitutional. Because of the resolution of the constitutionality of the statute, the remaining assignments of error were pretermitted.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court agreed, noting that the sign was open, obvious, and not hidden; it was daylight with clear conditions, and that the plaintiff walked past other signs of similar height.

Defendant's son took the police to the spot where defendant threw the boy, and the police found him dead.

Defendant appealed her conviction and sentence, claming a number of errors relating to jury selection and instructions, introduction of prejudicial evidence, insufficient evidence, and excessive imposition of sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought to have La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1221(3)(d)(iii) declared unconstitutional because it reduced his worker's compensation benefits. The court reversed the grant of defendants' motion for summary judgment. Section 23:1221(3)(d)(iii) was unconstitutional because it discriminated based on age. While not all persons over 62 years of age received Social Security old-age benefits, no recipient was under the age of 62, clearly making the limitation based on age. The equal protection standard under La. Const. art I, &sect; 3 required classification based on age to substantially further an important governmental objective. Preventing an injured worker from receiving double benefits and reducing worker's compensation insurance costs were legitimate state interests. There was not even a rational relationship between protecting income replacement programs such as worker's compensation and imposing on benefits for persons under 62 that did not depend on the person loosing an income, such as Social Security old-age benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of defendant's motion for summary judgment was reversed because the supplemental earnings benefits statute arbitrarily, capriciously, and unreasonably discriminated against persons age 62 and older and unconstitutionally denied them equal protection. The court remanded the case to the district court. Costs were assessed against defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the Twelfth Judicial District Court, Parish of Avoyelles, State of Louisiana, which imposed a 20-year sentence at hard labor not subject to diminution for good behavior, after defendant entered a manslaughter plea in the death of his minor daughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to 20 years at hard labor after entering a manslaughter plea in the death of his minor daughter. Defendant contended that trial court erred in imposing an unconstitutionally excessive sentence in light of defendant's youth, lack of prior criminal history, and his limited involvement in the death of his daughter. On appeal, the court held that, under the sentencing guidelines of La. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 894.1, the 20-year sentence imposed by the trial court was excessive. The court found that a 20-year sentence upon a young defendant who did not abuse or cause physical harm to his child did not measurably contribute to acceptable penal goals, and was a needless imposition of pain and suffering. The record disclosed that defendant, who fathered the child when he was only 17 years of age, did try to protect the child, caring for her and fighting with the mother over the abusive events he witnessed. Defendant's conduct of neglect and omission was not deliberately cruel, and he did not use violence or cause others to use violence against the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the 20-year prison sentence imposed by the trial court upon defendant, and remanded for sentencing in accordance with the opinion, on the grounds that the sentence imposed by the trial court, in light of defendant's youth, lack of criminal history, and his limited involvement in the death of his daughter, was excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A permanent injunction restraining defendant timber company from cutting timber on plaintiffs' property was vacated where plaintiffs failed to prove irreparable injury. Plaintiffs were co-owners of an undivided interest in timber property, which defendant also co-owned. Plaintiffs refused defendant's offer to buy the property where defendant offered a lower price paid to other sellers. Plaintiffs brought suit seeking an injunction against timber cutting, and a declaratory judgment holding that statute allowing defendant to cut the timber, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:4278.2, was unconstitutional. The trial court granted a permanent injunction and found the statute unconstitutional. The state's highest appellate court vacated and remanded for a determination of the remaining errors upon non-constitutional grounds. The court vacated the trial court's injunction, holding the statute did not specifically provide an injunctive remedy, and an injunction was improper where plaintiffs failed to prove an irreparable injury.

After being sentenced to eight years of hard labor, defendant filed a timely motion for reconsideration, which was denied; defendant appealed. Under Louisiana law, the court was prohibited from reviewing a sentence imposed in conformity with a plea agreement set forth in the record at the time of appeal. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.2 A(2). The court found that the sentenced imposed conformed to the cap in the plea agreement set forth on the record; thus, there was nothing to review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ex-wife appealed from a trial court decision upholding plaintiff ex-husband's objection to her intent to move their children out-of-state. Defendant's new husband had received a better job offer out-of-state. Plaintiff, however, contended the move would be detrimental to their minor children and would interfere with the father-children relationship. Absent an abuse of discretion, the trial court could permit a custodial parent to remove his or her children from the jurisdiction of the court. A parent who sought such a relocation had the burden of proving (1) that there was good reason for the move and it was made in good faith; and (2) the move was in the child's best interest. The court found no bad faith by defendant but found the move would be against the children's best interest and interfered with their relationship with their father when La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:355.12 factors were considered. Also, defendant had violated &sect; 9:355.1 which provided that a parent seeking to relocate the child's principal residence was required to obtain a temporary court order to do so. Finding no abuse of discretion by the trial judge, the court affirmed judgment for plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were the parents of a minor child allegedly injured by an act of medical malpractice. Plaintiffs made claims to the Louisiana Patient's Compensation Fund (PCF) for alleged future medical care and related benefits, most of which were rejected. Plaintiffs appealed in court the decision of the Louisiana Patients' Compensation Fund Oversight Board (Board). The PCF and the Board filed exceptions of venue and requested transfer for proper venue for judicial review of the Board's decision. The trial court maintained the exception of improper venue and transferred the case. Plaintiffs appealed, asserting the district court had continuing jurisdiction. The court affirmed the decision to transfer, concluding that the &quot;continuing jurisdiction&quot; referred to in La. Rev. Stat. 40:1299.E did not refer to venue for the very substantial role of judicial review of the Board's decisions. Rather, the principles of judicial review, including venue principles, were found in the Administrative Procedure Act. La. Rev. Stat. 49:964.B. The court further held that such venue was mandatory, litigating in another parish did not amount to an unreasonable burden, and venue was not waived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court ruling improper venue was affirmed because venue for judicial review of a decision of the compensation oversight board was found in the administrative procedure statute, such venue was mandatory, there was no constitutional burden in transferring the case, and there was no waiver of venue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the Louisiana Supreme Court and on appeal from the Nineteenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the court considered whether denial of defendant state's peremptory exception of no cause of action was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought redress for alleged violations under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and U.S. Const. amend. I. Plaintiffs asserted the &quot;no&quot; votes on the challenged referenda in 33 parishes that rejected video poker were constitutionally tainted by the declaration that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27:13C(6) was unconstitutional. The statute was the content-based prohibition of plaintiffs' freedom to organize and contribute money to political action committees opposed to the repeal of video poker. Defendant state filed a writ of peremptory exception of no cause of action. The trial court denied defendants' writ. The parties sought expedited review by the state supreme court, which remanded to the court. The court determined the proper remedy for plaintiff would have been a pre-election injunction. But because that was not pursued, plaintiffs had no remedy and amendment of pleadings would be ineffectual; thus, no cause of action existed. The court reversed the trial court's denial of the peremptory exception of no cause of action filed by defendant state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the lower court against defendant state denying the peremptory exception of no cause of action was reversed and remanded because amendment of a petition was not permitted when it would constitute a vain and useless act, as it would have been here. The proper remedy for plaintiffs, which was injunctive relief, was time based, and the time for plaintiffs to apply for that relief had passed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, 18 years of age, sought review of the judgment of the Tenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Natchitoches (Louisiana), which rendered judgment in favor of defendants, a school board and the state board of education, in a suit filed against them by plaintiff after he was not hired as a bus driver because he did not meet the 21-years-of age requirement of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, 18 years of age, sought employment with defendant school board as a school bus driver. Plaintiff was not hired because he did not meet the 21-year-old age requirement of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:491. Plaintiff brought an action against defendants, the school board and the state board of secondary and elementary education, claiming &sect; 17:491 had been amended or repealed by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:160, and in the alternative, that &sect; 17:491 was unconstitutional. A judgment in favor of defendants was affirmed on appeal. After considering the disfavor accorded implied repeals, the fact that no change was made between the two statutes with regard to prohibiting 18-year-olds from driving school buses, and because the statutes were not in conflict, no error was found in the trial court's finding that &sect; 17:160 had not repealed the age requirement found in &sect; 17:491. The court also affirmed the trial court's finding that &sect; 17:491 did not unconstitutionally violate La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 because the law was not found to be an arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable means of enforcing the government's interest in the safety of children riding school buses.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were the state of Louisiana, the governor, the attorney general, and the superintendent of the state police. Trial court granted a temporary restraining order and denied defendants' exception of non-joinder of necessary parties, the Louisiana Gaming Control Board and the Louisiana Lottery Corporation. The court of appeals affirmed the denial of the exception of non-joinder holding that those bodies were not necessary parties because the attorney general was their legal representative. The court dissolved and vacated the temporary restraining order holding restrictions of the ability to participate in the gaming industry and potentially to earn a profit was not irreparable harm.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured worker filed suit against defendant government agency. Defendant had caused plaintiff's workers' compensation class action to be dismissed when it enacted a new emergency rule prohibiting class actions in workers' compensation cases. Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that the rule was void because it was improperly adopted. Plaintiff also sought a ruling that the permanent rule adopted after the suit was filed was invalid as exceeding defendant's authority and was improperly applied to plaintiff retroactively. Defendant was granted summary judgment, and plaintiff appealed. The state appellate court affirmed. The court found that the thrust of plaintiff's argument was that an ex parte communication invariably occurred given the amount of time between the plaintiff's request for class certification and the enactment of emergency order barring such certification. The court found that no impropriety existed in a litigation party conducting ex parte discussions with a regulatory agency that lacked adjudicatory power. The court also held that because the permanent rule was properly adopted, summary judgment would have eventually been granted to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defendant's action to recover cash seized from his possession during arrests for cocaine possession, defendant argued that he was entitled to recovery because the state had admitted the property was noncontraband. The state's allegations in a prior proceeding that was later vacated and remanded with orders to start anew did not meet the criteria for judicial admission. The court held that the applicable law in the case was that in effect on the dates of the seizure of the cash, not subsequent legislation. The lower court did not err in applying La. Rev. Stat.

The state, at the time of defendant's arrests, bore the entire burden of proving that the property in question qualified as derivative contraband. Based on the record evidence, the court found that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the cash seized from defendant at the time of his arrests was derivative contraband and thus, subject to forfeiture.

Defendant appealed, contending the evidence was insufficient to convict him of distribution of cocaine. He argued that there were inconsistencies in the testimony presented by the prosecution's witnesses. The appellate court held that there was ample evidence for any rational juror to conclude that the defendant was guilty of distribution of cocaine beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant also contended that the trial failed to articulate for the record sufficient reasons to justify the sentence imposed, that the sentence is excessive, and that the minimum mandatory requirement is in violation of the state and federal constitutions because it removes sentencing discretion from the judicial branch. The trial court imposed the minimum sentence prescribed by statute, and defendant cited no authority to buttress his claims that a minimum mandatory sentence was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of three counts of auto theft or unauthorized use. He was sentenced to ten years at hard labor on the first and second counts and five years on the third count. While his motion for a new trial was pending, the state filed a multiple bill charging him as a fourth offender. The trial court held that defendant was a fourth offender and resentenced him on count one to life in prison. On appeal, the court affirmed the life sentence but remanded for resentencing on counts two and three because the maximum allowable sentence on count two for unauthorized use of a vehicle was five years less than the sentence rendered. The life sentence was warranted by the recommendation of the probation office and by defendant's lack of remorse, extensive criminal record, and threat of violence directed at the trial judge and his family. Failure to provide a continuance so that defendant could subpoena witnesses was not prejudicial because testimony that defendant detailed cars for them without stealing them would not disprove that he stole cars of other owners.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 40:967(B) before it was amended in 1997 and which was in effect at the time defendant committed the offenses did not provide for a restriction of parole benefits. The trial court's sentences were illegal as they provided restrictions on defendant's parole eligibility. The court reversed defendant's conviction for conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute because the evidence did not show that defendant and another individual conducted their drug dealing activities separately or acted in concert based upon an agreement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by a grand jury indictment for second-degree murder after he hit the victim with a baseball bat and shot him. Pursuant to a plea arrangement, defendant pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to the maximum sentence of 40 years hard labor. Defendant appealed the sentence claiming it was unconstitutionally excessive in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. VIII and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The state claimed that under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.2, defendant was precluded from appealing the sentence. On appeal, the court found that defendant was not told that he was waiving his right to appeal by pleading guilty to the reduced charge. Because he did not specifically waive his right to appeal his sentence, he could not be prohibited from exercising that right. The court held that review was required in open-ended pleas because appeals were favored and there was a constitutional right in Louisiana to an appeal. The record established a factual basis for the imposition of the maximum sentenced allowed, so that, under the circumstances, the sentence imposed was not excessive and the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, and the trial court sentenced defendant in conformity with the plea agreement. On appeal, defendant argued that his conviction and sentence should be vacated, because the trial court failed to inform him of the maximum sentence that could be imposed upon him. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction, however. The court found that at the Boykin hearing, the trial court informed defendant of his right to a trial by jury, his right to confront accusers, and his right against self-incrimination. The trial court did not inform defendant of his possible sentencing exposure if convicted after a trial. The appellate court found, however, that defense counsel's statement on the record and in defendant's presence, that he advised defendant he faced a mandatory life sentence if convicted, was sufficient to inform defendant of his sentencing exposure. The court held, therefore, that the trial court properly accepted defendant's guilty plea. The court also held that defendant failed to follow the requirements for attacking the constitutionality of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.2 (A)(2).</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court concluded the state had carried its burden of proving that defendant was the same person who plead guilty to the predicate offense. Moreover, because defendant failed to file a written response to the bill of information, or to challenge his predicate offense, he was precluded from raising the sufficiency of the predicate offense to attack his sentence as a multiple offender. Finally, because the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights on a prior occasion, defendant's claim that his prior guilty plea was not adequately proven to be a knowing and voluntary waiver of his constitutional rights was without merit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, husband and wife, sued relator hospital for strict liability and negligence, alleging that during plaintiff wife's hospitalization at relator hospital she was administered and/or sold several units of blood contaminated with the hepatitis C virus. Relator filed an exception of prescription, seeking dismissal of the action under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5268. The lower court denied the writ and found that the statute of limitations, &sect; 9:5268, applied only to medical malpractice actions and not to strict products liability actions in tort. Relator appealed. The court found that, although the conclusion that the special medical malpractice statute of limitation, &sect; 9:5628, did not apply to a strict tort products liability action arising out of the sale of blood in a diseased or defective condition was confirmed, because plaintiffs' cause of action arose after LA. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.41(A)(8) was amended, it had to be considered a malpractice action, which was barred by &sect; 9:5628. The writ application was granted, the judgment of the trial court was reversed, the exception of prescription was sustained, and the complaint was dismissed with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed appellee's decisions. Appellant met all three criteria under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:571.3 for denying good time. Appellant was sentenced as a habitual offender for a crime committed after September 10, 1977 and the crime was one of the enumerated offenses under the dangerous substances law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a judgment from the Nineteenth Judicial District Court in and for Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) that dismissed his action challenging revocation of his probation. Plaintiff claimed that revocation proceedings were improperly instituted before the expiration of parole, that automatic revocation upon a felony conviction without a hearing violated due process, and that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:574.10 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of plaintiff's challenge to a parole revocation was affirmed. Revocation was instituted after plaintiff was arrested on felony charges. The appellate court held that revocation proceedings were &quot;properly instituted&quot; prior to the expiration of the parole term by a notice of preliminary hearing containing a bill of particulars, accompanied by the required form. Also, the parole term was suspended pursuant to plaintiff's voluntary waiver and deferral of the preliminary and final revocation hearings until after the disposition of the charges. Automatic revocation upon the felony conviction with neither a preliminary nor final revocation hearing did not violate due process. Plaintiff deferred his right to a preliminary hearing until the disposition of his charges. In doing so, he waived his right to a probable cause hearing immediately after arrest. There was no error or prejudice in the deferral or waiver. The automatic parole revocation procedure set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:574.10 did not violate due process. Because parole revocation was automatic following the felony conviction, the U.S. Constitution did not require a final revocation hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A judgment that dismissed plaintiff's action challenging revocation of his probation was affirmed where revocation proceedings were properly instituted prior to the expiration of the parole term, automatic revocation upon a felony conviction without a hearing did not violate due process, the statutory automatic revocation procedure was constitutional, and finality of conviction was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by bill of information with molestation of a juvenile over whom he had control or supervision, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.2. He pleaded not guilty and waived his right to a jury trial. After a bench trial, defendant was convicted as charged. He received a sentence of 10 years at hard labor. Defendant appealed and claimed the trial court erred in denying his right to confrontation by requiring him to sit behind a screen during the victim's testimony and by refusing to allow defense counsel to speak with him prior to cross-examination of the victim, and that the sentence was excessive. The court affirmed the judgment. The record failed to demonstrate any violation of defendant's confrontation rights; an irregularity or error could not be availed of after verdict unless it was objected to at the time of occurrence. The trier of fact observed the demeanor of the child victim and the child victim was subjected to cross-examination. The essential elements of the right to confrontation were satisfied. Defendant's motion to reconsider sentence was untimely and he was barred procedurally from having it reviewed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were companies that operated within defendant town. Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment after a municipal tax was passed that caused the aggregate tax within defendant to become four and two-thirds percent. Plaintiffs contended this percent was unlawful because it violated the four percent maximum imposed on sales-and-use taxes found in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2721.6(A)(2) and La. Const. art VI, &sect; 29(B). The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment because &sect; 33:2721.6(A)(2) and &sect; 29 did not prohibit defendant from levying a tax that exceeded four percent. The court reversed the decision and remanded for further proceedings. The express statutory provisions did not allow for sales-and-use taxes that exceed four percent. If defendant wanted to exceed such percent, it could obtain legislative consent pursuant to &sect; 29(B). The fact that several other municipalities' taxes exceeded four percent did not justify ignoring the statute's provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury convicted defendant for aggravated escape and first degree robbery.

Defendant was sentenced as a habitual offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5:529.1(D)(1)(b). On appeal, the convictions and the sentence were affirmed because the convictions were supported by sufficient evidence. The trial court did not err in refusing to grant a mistrial when the prosecution referred to other crimes to establish that defendant was legally incarcerated at the time of the escape.

The court found defendant was advised of his rights and indicated that he understood those rights. The trial court also did not err by not granting defendant's motion for mistrial due to the fact that the jury was told that he was not present in the courtroom and that he had to be brought into the courtroom, and that two jurors saw him shackles. The court found defendant was not prejudiced and was able to receive a fair trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant prisoner appealed her conviction of a crime against nature, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:89, from the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), contending her enhanced sentence was excessive and that the court erred in finding her to be a third felony offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant prisoner sought review of her conviction of a crime against nature and contended that the lower court erred when it found her to have been a third felony offender and she also contended that her enhanced sentence was excessive. In regards to the third felony offender status, the court stated that prisoner neither filed a written response to the bill of information nor did she challenge the state's proof of the guilty pleas or their compliance with Boykin at any time before her sentence was imposed. The court held that because prisoner failed to challenge the habitual offender status in the lower court, prisoner had waived review of those issues. The court stated when it reviewed a sentence for excessiveness, it considered the punishment in light of the harm to society and whether the penalty was so disproportionate to shock its sense of justice. The court held that in light of prisoner's previous convictions and that prisoner committed the offense after she knew she was HIV positive, the prisoner's sentence was not excessive. Conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Prisoner failed to object to the habitual offender status in the lower court, and raised the issues for the first time on appeal, therefore it was precluded from review and the enhanced sentence imposed was not so disproportionate to have been deemed excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant prisoner was convicted of multiple counts of armed robbery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 16:64. Prisoner contended that his sentence to serve 50 years on each count was excessive. The court held that prisoner's sentence was not excessive. The court noted that prior criminal activity was one of the factors to be considered by the court in sentencing a defendant, but that prior criminal activity was not limited to convictions. Additionally, the court noted that the lower court could have imposed the maximum sentence of 99 years for each conviction, but it imposed approximately one half of the maximum term of imprisonment that could have been imposed. The court stated that the lower court failed to observe the 24-hour period between denial of a defense motion for new trial and sentencing of the prisoner as was required by La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 873. The court also noted that prisoner did not waive that delay. The court held that the lower court's failure to have observed the delay provisions were not harmless, even though prisoner's sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive. Prisoner's sentence was vacated and remanded to the lower court for re-sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of attempted first-degree robbery for attempting to rob a convenience store clerk while leading the victim to reasonably believe he was armed with a dangerous weapon. Defendant was sentenced to 10 years at hard labor without parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed, contending the sentence was excessive as he had a toy gun, which he chose not to use, and made no threats or threatening gestures. The court affirmed. The trial judge considered the following factors: defendant's two prior felony convictions, undue risk that during suspension or probation defendant would commit an additional crime, need of correctional treatment or custodial environment provided most effectively by commitment to an institution, and that a lesser sentence would deprecate the seriousness of the crime. Although the circumstances of the crime were peculiar, the sentence was not disproportionate nor did it shock the court's sense of justice. Given the circumstances and defendant's background, especially his two prior felony convictions, the sentence was not too severe, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which convicted him for the illegal carrying of a weapon while in possession of a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95(E), and sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on a no-knock search warrant leading to a search of defendant's bedroom, the police found hidden cocaine and weapons there. After defendant was convicted for illegal carrying of a weapon while in possession of cocaine, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95(E), and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment without parole, he appealed. He claimed he was denied due process under U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV, and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. He contended that the sentence was excessive, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII, XIV, and La. Const. art. I, &sect;20. Finally, he claimed that &sect; 14:95(E) was unconstitutionally vague and unconstitutional as applied to him. The court affirmed the conviction, finding no merit in any of those arguments. There was sufficient evidence to show defendant's guilt through possession, there was no constitutional violation, and the sentence was appropriate. The trial court erred, however, in failing to properly advise the defendant of the prescriptive period for post-conviction relief. It instructed the trial court to give the notice required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 940.8, as well as to remove an erroneous reference to a guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for possession of cocaine and weapons, because it was supported by the evidence. It required the trial court to give proper notice of the statutory right to post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant sought review of a judgment from the Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Section J (Louisiana), which sentenced him to life imprisonment without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence upon his conviction for second-degree murder in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that reversal of criminal defendant's conviction based on defendant having to use five peremptory challenges when his challenges for cause were denied, was not warranted where defendant failed to show prejudice. The court also found that it was not error to deny defendant's motion for mistrial on the basis of the improper admission of hearsay evidence where some statements were admissible as &quot;excited utterances,&quot; and the other testimony had not been objected to by defense counsel, and was harmless as cumulative evidence. The court then found that there was sufficient evidence for the conclusion that defendant had caused the victim's death during an armed robbery, noting that witness testimony established that defendant's actions were a substantial contributing factor to the victim's resulting death. The court affirmed, finding that the denial of defendant's motion to reconsider his sentence was proper where the mandatory life sentence imposed was not constitutionally excessive and defense counsel had presented no evidence at sentencing to show that defendant should not have received the legislatively mandated sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed criminal defendant's conviction and sentence. Defendant had failed to show that he suffered prejudice from having to use five peremptory challenges when his challenges for cause were denied. Defendant was properly found to have murdered the victim where the evidence showed that defendant's actions during the armed robbery substantially contributed to the victim's resulting death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A man that a woman knew as her son's acquaintance sexually assaulted her. Defendant was charged with aggravated rape in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42. At trial, the woman identified defendant as the attacker. The trial court convicted defendant and sentenced him to life imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's post-verdict motion for acquittal under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 821 because the evidence, including the victim's identification of defendant, was sufficient to support the conviction. The trial court properly denied defendant's challenge to the prosecution's strike of a prospective juror because defendant did not demonstrate that she was excused based upon her race; although the transcript was incomplete, it revealed that the juror's daughter had been convicted and that the defendant's attorney had previously represented her or a family member. The trial court properly excluded evidence that the attacker of a previous rape victim was white, where defendant had been suspected of committing the previous rape, as the prosecution did not offer the previous rape as other crimes evidence.</SPAN></P>

At defendant's trial for possession of heroin, a police officer mentioned he found money in defendant's possession consistent with the sale of narcotics.

Defendant appealed, claiming the record was useless for effective appellate review, the trial court erred in denying mistrial, and his sentence was constitutionally excessive. The court affirmed because the record was not useless for appellate review, there was nothing to indicate that the officer's comment at trial made it impossible for defendant to have obtained a fair trial, and defendant did not show substantial evidence to clearly and convincingly show that his mandatory minimum sentence was constitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, state department of health and state hospital, appealed the judgment from the 19th Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), that held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.39 did not apply to plaintiff's complaint, and awarded general, medical, and lost earnings damages to plaintiff son and loss of consortium to plaintiff mother on their negligence claim against defendant hospital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother took 6-year-old plaintiff son to defendant hospital where the doctor failed to follow hospital procedure by not calling a pediatrician, and did not admit him; plaintiff son had meningococcemia that led to the amputation of both his legs and two fingers. Plaintiffs sued defendants, state department of health and hospital. The trial court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1299.39, which capped malpractice damages, was inapplicable, and entered judgment upon a jury verdict for plaintiff son for medical, general, and lost earnings damages, and for plaintiff mother for loss of consortium. On appeal, the court held that because plaintiff son was first treated after the effective date of the statute, and because the hospital's procedure involved the care of patients, thus making plaintiffs' claim a malpractice claim, the statutory cap applied. The court found that the weight of the evidence showed that the hospital and the doctor committed malpractice. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment, but, pursuant to the statute, reversed the award for lost earnings and loss of consortium and reduced the general damages to the statutory maximum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of plaintiff son because it was supported by the weight of the evidence, but because defendant hospital's failure to ensure that its doctors followed hospital procedures was malpractice, held that the malpractice statute limiting non-medical damages applied. The court reduced the general damages, and reversed the award of loss of earnings damages and the loss of consortium damages to plaintiff mother.</SPAN></P>

The defendant challenged the trial court's decision declining to enforce an alleged plea agreement. Defendant challenged the state's criminal discovery procedures as unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of both the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's not guilty plea, trial by jury, conviction of aggravated burglary in violation of La. Rev.

The court held it was not an abuse of discretion to refuse to enforce a plea agreement under which defendant had agreed to plead guilty in exchange for a lesser prison sentence. Based upon the prosecutor's testimony, it was clear defendant had rejected the plea agreement. Once rejected, the plea agreement could not be revived by defendant's purported acceptance because there was no longer an offer for defendant to accept. The court held the state's criminal discovery procedures, under La. Rev. Stat.

The differences between the state's civil and criminal discovery procedures were rationally based.

Rejecting defendant's contention that &sect; 40:981.3 as written was overinclusive and unconstitutional, the court held that the statute, even applied after school hours, bore a rational relationship to the state's interest in protecting school age children from the dangers of drugs and drug related crime. Defendant was precluded from seeking review of her sentence under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.1D, the court held, because she had not filed a motion to reconsider sentence. The court held that defendant was likewise precluded under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.2A(2), because she had pled guilty to a specific sentencing agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence under the drug free zone statute, finding that the trial court had not erred in denying defendant's motion to quash. The court also found that defendant had waived her right to a review of her sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute as well as his life sentence from the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana). He contended that the evidence of intent to distribute cocaine was insufficient to sustain his conviction, counsel was ineffective for failure to object to cross-examination concerning defendant's prior convictions, and the sentence was unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court deferred to the jury's determination that the amount of cocaine defendant possessed indicated an intent to distribute. It found no error in the jury's finding that the quantity was enough to support the intent to distribute, and therefore, this assignment of error had no merit. Further, questioning on cross-examination as to defendant's prior bad acts was permissible under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 609.1. Defendant's trial counsel had no basis to object to the state's examination, and counsel was not ineffective for failing to object. Additionally, the court held that the lower court did not err in imposing the mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence upon finding defendant to be a quadruple offender. Thus, his sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive, and the court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that the jury was entitled to use the quantity of a controlled substance to infer intent to distribute, the court affirmed the conviction and the life sentence where assignments as to cross-examination of prior bad acts and mandatory life sentencing for a quadruple offender were not errors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Criminal District Court Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which convicted him of a crime against nature. The question was whether La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:89 A (1), which criminalized private, non-commercial sexual activity between consenting adults, violated the right to privacy expressly guaranteed by La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for crime against nature, claiming that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:89 A (1), which criminalized private, non-commercial sexual activity between consenting adults, violated the right to privacy expressly guaranteed by La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5. The reviewing court agreed and reversed his conviction. The court found that the statute had withstood challenges for vagueness and overbreadth but concluded that the statute violated the privacy clause of the Louisiana Constitution. While the state argued that the case was not a case of two consenting adults engaging in private behavior, the court disagreed. The trial court did not find the alleged victim at all credible. The finding that there was oral sex was the sole basis of defendant's conviction. The state offered no compelling state interest to justify the criminalization of non-commercial sexual conduct that occurred without force, in private, between two consenting adults. The state did not suggest and the court could not discern a benefit to the state that would warrant the unduly oppressive invasion of an individual's constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy imposed by section 14:89 A (1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for crime against nature was reversed. The statute was an unconstitutional infringement upon the right to privacy to the extent that it criminalized the performance of private, consensual, non-commercial acts of sexual intimacy between individuals who were legally capable of giving their consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant one and defendant two were convicted on four counts of attempted possession of drugs, including heroin and cocaine, and possession of codeine and alprazolam. Defendant two's sentence as a second-felony habitual offender essentially totaled 50 years in prison. Defendant one's sentence as fourth-felony habitual offender essentially totaled life imprisonment. Both defendants appealed their sentences. The convictions were affirmed for the cocaine and heroin counts, but the cocaine sentence was reversed because the court sentenced each defendant to 10 years and the maximum was 5 years. The court also reversed the conviction for defendant one on the codeine and alprazolam counts because he never had possession of those pills, only defendant two had possession of the pills. The court also held that an excessive sentence was not imposed on defendant two. The total of all sentences imposed on him was 70 years, and he would only serve 50 because the sentences were to be served concurrently. This was a reasonable sentence because defendant two could have received the maximum sentence of 100 years as a second-felony habitual offender on the heroin charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Criminal Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which convicted defendant of carnal knowledge of a juvenile in violation of Law. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:80, claiming that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction and that the sentence was excessive and failed to comply with La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 894.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had sexual relations with victim, who was thirteen years old. Defendant was charged and convicted with carnal knowledge of a juvenile in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:80. Defendant was sentenced to serve 20 years at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendant's motions in arrest of judgment and new trial were subsequently denied. The trial court failed to rule on defendant's motions prior to sentencing defendant. La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 853, 861 required that such motions be disposed of prior to sentencing. As such, defendant's sentence was vacated and remanded for resentencing. Defendant asserted that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction, alleging that prosecution failed to produce evidence that he was over the age of 17 and more than two years older than victim was. Victim testified that she was 13 years old when she engaged in sexual intercourse with defendant. A jury could infer that an accused was over the age of 17 by his physical appearance and the fact he was being tried as an adult. As such, defendant's conviction was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for carnal knowledge of a juvenile, holding that evidence sufficiently proved that defendant was over the age of 17 and more than two years older than victim. The court vacated and remanded the matter for resentencing because the trial judge had not disposed of defendant's motions for new trial and arrest of judgment and because defendant was erroneously denied the possibility of parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cross-defendant employer intervened in a lawsuit filed by an employee against cross-plaintiff restaurant where employee was injured. Cross-defendant intervened to recover the amount of workers' compensation benefits it paid to employee. Cross-plaintiffs filed a claim for indemnity and cross-defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. The lower court granted the motion and cross-plaintiffs appealed. The court dismissed the appeal because the parties failed to comply with La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1915(B). The court held that absent an agreement of the parties, or a trial court's determination that there was no just reason to delay an immediate appeal, accompanied by a designation as a final judgment by the trial court, partial summary judgment was not immediately appealable. The court found there was no clear agreement in the record that cross-plaintiffs could appeal and the trial court did not designate the judgment as final for immediate appeal. The court noted that the mere signing of the order of appeal did not satisfy the requirements for immediate appeal. Because cross-plaintiffs did not comply with the procedural requirements of an appeal, it was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2501.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, two children excluded from their father's 1991 will, argued their entitlement as forced heirs to a share of decedent's estate, and asserted their substantive rights of reduction and collation pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2501(B). The court disagreed, noting first that the father died in 1997 leaving his estate to siblings of plaintiffs. Explaining, the court observed that &sect; 9:2501(A), the law then in effect, abolished forced heirships and denied a forced heir's right to reduce a legacy. Construing &sect; 9:2501(B), the court ruled that this provision merely aided in the interpretation of testaments and was not a substantive provision granting collation and reduction rights. Thus, plaintiffs would prevail only if the will could be construed as having a donative intent, the court added. However, extrinsic evidence of a testator's intent was not permissible because the will was not susceptible to different meanings, the court stated. Noting that the law in effect at the time the will was executed did not allow for forced heirship rights, and that decedent's intent to exclude plaintiffs was clear from the will, the court ruled that plaintiffs' suit must fail.</SPAN></P>

The trial court maintained defendants' exception of prescription and dismissed the supplemental petition, stating that plaintiffs' nullity action was brought too late. Plaintiffs appealed, claiming that their nullity action was timely. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal. It explained that under La. Code Civ. Proc.

Another officer arrived with a narcotics dog and defendant was arrested after the dog indicated that drugs were in the trunk. Defendant argued that any evidence seized was seized illegally.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a medical malpractice suit that alleged she contracted Hepatitis from a blood transfusion. The trial court found that the three-year period in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628 applied in favor of all defendants and dismissed the claims. Pursuant to a motion for a new trial, the trial court found that defendant blood centers were not included in the lawsuit, and reversed its earlier ruling, and found that the claim had not prescribed against the center under either the one-year or three-year prescriptive periods. Defendant hospital's peremptory exception on the three-year prescriptive period was sustained. On appeal, plaintiff argued that the trial court erred in not applying the proper prescriptive period of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3492. The court found that the claims were not filed within the maximum limitations period in accordance with &sect; 9:5628, and affirmed the ruling sustaining the hospital's exception of prescription.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the result of an injury in the course and scope of employment, defendant employer voluntarily commenced compensation payments to plaintiff employee. Defendant, however, ceased payments when plaintiff was incarcerated and charged with murder and, subsequently, refused to recognize the paternity of plaintiff's minor child who asserted an entitlement to receive benefits under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1201.4. As a result, plaintiff brought suit against defendant. Based on a finding that defendant's refusal to recognize the minor child's dependency and paternity were arbitrary and capricious, the Office of Workers' Compensation (Louisiana) awarded attorney fees to plaintiff but refused to award any dependent benefits. On appeal, defendant challenged the attorney fee award. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, finding that the award of attorney fees was error because benefits were not due to the minor child. An award of attorney fees was permitted where an employer arbitrarily and capriciously refused to pay benefits due but was not permitted for defendant's refusal to acknowledge paternity when there was no finding of benefits owing to the minor child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff association obtained a horse racing license from defendant state racing commission, but it never opened a racetrack. Plaintiff sued the state, requesting the court to declare unconstitutional certain laws regulating off-track wagering. The laws were upheld. Thus, plaintiff was prohibited from seeking a license to conduct off-track wagering. A later consent decree between plaintiff and defendant suspended the horse racing license previously issued to plaintiff. Defendant approved two requests from a racetrack licensed to conduct off-track wagering. The only effect of defendant's approval of these requests was to allow this racetrack to cause referendum elections to approve off-track wagering in the parish where it hoped to relocate. Plaintiff petitioned for judicial review of defendant's rulings. The trial court granted defendant's exception of no cause of action. The court affirmed. Defendant's actions had absolutely no effect on plaintiff, which was not a licensed racing association. Moreover, even if plaintiff was a licensed racing association, it was prohibited by law from conducting off-track wagering. Thus, plaintiff had no standing to contest defendant's actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of plaintiff's petition for no cause of action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured party while working as an election commissioner slipped and fell off of the bottom step of a polling place. Plaintiff fell off the bottom step because it was broken at an angle at the corner of the step. When she fell, she broke her fall with her right hand causing a severe fracture to her right wrist. Plaintiffs, injured party and spouse, brought an action against defendants, parish and parish council, claiming that the building and stairs were defective and defendants were strictly liable to plaintiffs. The trial court granted a judgment of damages in favor of plaintiffs. Defendants sought review of the decision. The court affirmed, holding that the record supported the trial court's findings that the steps plaintiff fell on were in defendants' custody, and the broken concrete step coupled with the absence of handrails presented an unreasonable risk of harm to plaintiff. The court found that the defective condition of the step caused plaintiff's injuries, and that defendants had constructive notice of the defective condition. Therefore, the court held that the trial committed no error by finding defendants strictly liable.</SPAN></P>

Act 1483 of 1997 declared unconstitutional. The appellate court granted the writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation entered into a contract with the state to operate an on-line electronic benefits transfer system for the state to distribute food-stamp benefits. Some merchants, however, elected to use the point of service (POS) card-processing equipment they were already using for credit and debit cards. La. Act 1483 of 1997, provided that merchants would have the option to use POS terminals provided by third-party processors at no cost to the merchants and that the merchants would be reimbursed for any costs incurred. The corporation brought an action challenging the retroactive application of the law. The trial court denied the corporation's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the appellate court determined the trial court was correct in denying the motion for summary judgment. The appellate court reasoned that genuine issues of material fact remained regarding the extent of the impairment, the public purpose behind the regulation, the historical background of the regulation, and, if there was a legitimate public purpose, whether the alteration of the contract was reasonable and appropriate to the public purpose justifying the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

Ann. &sect; 40:1299.39, the defendants, a hospital and the State of Louisiana, appealed from the trial court's judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, a patient and her parents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When there was malpractice causing a patient's injury, and plaintiffs brought survival and wrongful death claims, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.39, there was one $ 500,000.00 cap for all claims. The trial court did not err in awarding damages when plaintiffs would receive the full amount they were entitled to recover from other health care provider defendants. Qualified health care provider status under the Medical Liability for State Services Act (MLSSA) was only a limitation on liability. The trial court properly awarded future medical expenses under the La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.39(F)(1) requirement that a court's judgment include a recitation of a patient's future medical care needs. The statutory cap in the MLSSA was not a violation of the equal protection and access to courts provisions of the Louisiana Constitution. The cap treated plaintiffs differently, but the discrimination was not arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. The statutory cap did not violate La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 10 on sovereign immunity because non-governmental tortfeasors were afforded the same substantive defenses as governmental tortfeasors. The statutory cap was not a local or special law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administrators filed suit against defendant parish alleging the parish breached a duty to maintain a reasonably safe city street. The parish filed a motion for summary judgment, which the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, granted. The claims against the parish were dismissed. The administrators appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three pedestrians were walking in a westerly direction along the subject city street. They were on or near the street proper in the vicinity of a vacant lot when two of them were hit by a car being driven westerly. One of them died almost instantly while the other was seriously injured. The vacant lot was devoid of a sidewalk. The administrators alleged the parish was responsible for the inspection of the subject street and for the enforcement of ordinances and statutes requiring the installation of sidewalks. They also argued the parish had a non-discretionary duty to enforce its ordinances concerning the obligation of property owners to maintain sidewalks and/or other means of safe ingress and egress across property within the parish. The trial court granted the parish summary judgment based on statutory governmental immunity. The appeals court concluded there was no meaningful showing the duty imposed on the parish regarding sidewalk installation was not discretionary, or that the parish had engaged in any willful misconduct. As the administrators did not demonstrate they could negate the parish's statutory immunity defense, summary judgment was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, by jury, convicted three co-defendants of second-degree murder. Two co-defendants appealed before the third, thus the instant decision was only in regard to the first two.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Carrying a gun, the co-defendant not involved in the appeal forced his way into an apartment. He chased a teen upstairs and shot him dead. He told a woman to &quot;give it up.&quot; Two other co-defendants entered and went upstairs, joining an attack against a man, and as they left one told the adults, &quot;I got your baby.&quot; Two of them took off their face-covering bandanas as they left. All three were identified through photos later. The appellate court held that although one co-defendant's amended indictment did not specify the subsection of the statute under which he was charged, he had received fair notice given the open file discovery and the answer to his co-defendant's motion for bill of particulars. Eyewitness, rather than ballistics and blood evidence, was sufficient. The child witnesses had known the co-defendants and their traits or eyes. Specific intent could be inferred from the masked faces, attack of the victim's father, and failure to help the victim. As none of the co-defendants' defenses were antagonistic, denial of severance was proper. As a child had made his identification before a certain motion hearing, there had been no failure to sequester him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was ordered to send written notice to the co-defendants of the prescriptive period for post-conviction relief applications and to file written proof in the record that they received such notice. Otherwise, the judgments were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Under La. Child. Code art. 1029, the petition to intervene was denied. La. Child. Code art. 1029 prohibited intervenors in parental rights termination proceedings. The grandparents challenged La. Child. Code art. 1029 on equal protection and due process grounds. The appellate court upheld La. Child. Code art. 1029. La. Child. Code art. 1029 did not contain a classification that fell into the strict or intermediate scrutiny levels. La. Child. Code art. 1029 satisfied the rational basis test, as the proper focus for such a proceeding was on the best interests of the child, not the grandparents' interests. The grandparents' interests were addressed in dispositional review proceedings instead. La. Child. Code art. 1029 had a rational basis under due process.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the appellate court affirmed the judgment. There was nothing in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98.10-98.14 that imposed a duty upon the party hosts not to share alcohol with the driver of the car the mother's son was riding in. The underage party hosts, who obtained alcohol and furnished it to other people who were under the legal drinking age, were not liable for the tortious behavior of one of those people resulting from his or her consumption of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police chased a stolen vehicle driven by defendant. Stolen weapons were found in the vehicle. Defendant had previously been convicted of burglary and had outstanding warrants for similar offenses. His motion in limine to preclude the State from referring to the prior conviction was denied. The appellate court held that the evidence created an irresistible inference that he picked up the guns and drove off. The trial court gave a limited instruction to the jury on its consideration of defendant's prior conviction that answered any problems of unfair prejudice. Given defendant's propensity to make a life of breaking and entering, the trial court was entitled to find that correctional treatment was needed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction in the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which entered a judgment of conviction on the charge of possession of cocaine in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(F) and vacated its original sentence of 15 years' imprisonment at hard labor and imposed an enhanced sentence of 30 years' imprisonment at hard labor without parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine found after a consent search of his home. Defendant presented no evidence at trial, but sought review alleging several errors. The court held that: (1) under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 841, defendant waived his objection to the prosecutor's commenting on defendant's failure to testify by neglecting to object at trial; (2) defendant failed to show prejudice resulting from the trial judge's ruling that the jury could view certain documents outside the presence of defendant; (3) there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(F)(1)(a) because the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had admitted to the possession to two testifying officers; (4) defendant's prior conviction in Mississippi for burglary could be used to adjudicate defendant as a second felony offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1) because in Louisiana, burglary was a felony; and (5) there was no evidence to rebut the presumption of the constitutionality of defendant's sentence under the state's Habitual Offender Law, under which defendant's enhanced sentence was the statutory minimum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, and remanded the matter for resentencing with instructions that the trial court send written notice to defendant of the prescriptive period for post-conviction relief, and that the trial court file written proof in the record that defendant received such notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, was previously convicted of simple robbery and possession of marijuana, appealed his conviction for purse snatching and his sentence as a third offender under the multiple offender statute. He claimed that the statute was unconstitutional and that the evidence did not support the verdict or sentence. The court affirmed the judgment, ruling that because defendant failed to complain about the prior convictions by filing a written response under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(D)(1)(b) to the habitual offender bill of information, he did not preserve for appeal the argument that the State did not produce sufficient proof of his prior convictions. Defendant also failed to prove that the mandatory minimum sentence under the statute was unconstitutional as applied. The statute mandated a life sentence if one of the three convictions was for a violent crime, and all three of defendant's offenses were violent under &sect; 14:2(13). The one on one confrontation with the victim when defendant was in the police cruiser was also permissible because it was justified by the circumstances, and defendant was apprehended within a short time of the crime and returned to the crime scene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was caught dealing a small amount of crack cocaine. As he had three prior convictions, one for possession of stolen property and two for possession of cocaine, the life sentence imposed by the trial court was mandatory under La. Rev. Stat.

The appellate court rejected defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as he did not show how he was prejudiced by his counsel's failure to file a written answer or a motion to quash the habitual offender bill of information. His counsel's failed attempt to show defendant did not have prior convictions was due not to counsel's ineffectiveness, but to the evidence the State presented. The trial court adequately complied with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 by advising defendant that his life sentence was mandatory. However, the appellate court could not conclude that the life sentence was not excessive under the constitutional standard. At 24, defendant was young enough to be rehabilitated. All his offenses were non-violent, he had the support of his father, and he was a minor-league drug dealer who did so to support his addiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town appealed a summary declaratory judgment of the 18th Judicial District Court, Iberville Parish (Louisiana), in favor of plaintiff citizen (and possibly his purported class) in his constitutional challenge to the town's authority to establish a mayor's court in which the citizen had been convicted of a traffic offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Louisiana town established a mayor's court to handle certain minor criminal and traffic offenses. An angry citizen (who had not appealed his traffic conviction in that court) brought a declaratory judgment constitutional challenge to the ordinance that established the mayor's court, styling it as a class action. The trial court deferred ruling on the class certification issue, but declared the ordinance unconstitutional. Although the town did not mention the issue on appeal, the appellate court, on its own initiative, noted that the pre-1997 version of La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 593.1 applicable to the instant action required a trial court to rule on the issue of whether class certification was appropriate before taking any further action in a purported class action proceeding. Therefore, that issue would have to be determined on remand before the trial court could even consider the constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the declaratory judgment and remanded with instructions that the trial court determine the issue of class certification before it did anything further.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted second degree murder after shooting the victim and was sentenced to 22 years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of the sentence. The court first held that the trial court properly instructed the jury that defendant bore the burden of proving intoxication and self-defense. The court then held that there was no evidence that the victim was about to use force against defendant, nor was there evidence of criminal trespass by the victim, who was helping his ex-wife move out of her apartment at the time of the shooting. The court reasoned that the jury was entitled to reject the testimony of defendant's witnesses to the contrary, and that they reasonably rejected defendant's contention that he had been intoxicated in light of police testimony that defendant exhibited no signs of intoxication at the time of the shooting. The court further noted that defendant had previously threatened to kill the victim. The court concluded that while the trial court's sentence may have seemed harsh, the trial court noted that the crime was particularly violent, without provocation, and caused significant damage to the victim.</SPAN></P>

Merely making an introduction and inquiring, in the presence of an undercover officer, whether the defendant had drugs for sale, was not sufficient participation to warrant disclosure of the confidential informant's identity.

Ann. &sect; 32:295.1 was not a primary offense, i.e., one for which a driver could initially be stopped, and, therefore, that the stops were unlawful. The statute stated, in part, that no vehicle or driver could have been inspected, detained, or searched solely because of a violation of that section. After it examined the ambiguous statutory wording and ambiguous legislative intent, the court held La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:295.1(F) prohibited not only further detention, but the initial detention, or stop, as well. Because defendant in the first case was stopped solely for violation of &sect; 32:295.1, the court reversed his conviction and attendant sentence for failure to wear a seat belt. However, that defendant's arrests and convictions for resisting an arrest and battery of a police officer were not unlawful. The court ruled that, in the second case, the motion to suppress was erroneously granted with regard to the evidence related to the second defendant's subsequent arrest for second offense driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), that convicted him of first-degree murder, which was a crime per La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30. Defendant contended, inter alia, that the State failed to prove that he had specific intent to kill the victim and that &sect; 14:30(a) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder as defined by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30. He was driving in a vehicle when he shot at a person that had brawled with his sister, but the victim that was killed was not the person that had brawled with her. Defendant appealed to the court, and the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court rejected the contention that the State did not prove specific intent. The doctrine of transferred intent applied to satisfy the requirement. Defendant had admitted that he intended to kill or inflict great bodily harm on the brawler. &quot;Drive-by-shooting&quot; was defined per La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:37.1 as the discharge of a firearm from a motor vehicle on a public street or highway with the intent either to kill, cause harm to, or frighten another person.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 prohibited killing when engaged in a drive-by-shooting. The court held that &sect; 14:30 was not unconstitutionally vague. The term public was of such generally accepted meaning as to give adequate notice of the concept being described and intended by the legislature. Defendant did not have standing to challenge &sect; 14:30 on the basis of overbreadth.</SPAN></P>

The attorney's counsel also used information from the records in a memorandum filed with the court. The client filed a motion for sanctions against the attorney and counsel. The trial court found that each had violated the privilege of the information and fined each $ 500.00. The attorney and counsel sought review on the grounds that La. Code Evid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants contended that the supreme court would take the opportunity to limit the application of La. Rev.

The claimants raised the issue of the unconstitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628 in their memorandum in opposition to the exception filed by the health care providers. The record did not reveal that the claimants filed a petition, answer, or any other pleading raising the unconstitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant mother moved to terminate visitation between her children and plaintiffs, the children's paternal relatives, arguing that the visitation was not in the children's best interest and attacking the constitutionality of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 136B. The Seventeenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of Lafourche, Louisiana, denied the motion to terminate and found art. 136B constitutional. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only issue on appeal was the constitutionality of art. 136B, which, inter alia, provided for visitation with a relative, by blood or affinity, under extraordinary circumstances where such visitation was in the children's best interests. The mother argued that art. 136B infringed on her fundamental rights to raise her children and to decide whom they should see. Because a fundamental right of personal privacy relating to child rearing and family relationships was involved, the appellate court applied strict scrutiny. The appellate court found that the state and the relatives had a substantial interest in maintaining extended family relationships through reasonable visitation in light of the fragmentation of the children's primary family through divorce and in anticipation of a possible order of future support pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 229. La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 136B was rationally related to the state's compelling interest in stabilizing broken or single parent families through visitation with extended family members, and was narrowly drawn to serve that interest without unduly infringing on parental rights. Thus, art. 136B was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's ruling upholding the constitutionality of the civil code article in question and assessed the costs of the appeal to the mother.</SPAN></P>
