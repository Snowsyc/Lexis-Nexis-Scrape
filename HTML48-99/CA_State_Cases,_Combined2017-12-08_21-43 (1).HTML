Defendant filed a motion to set aside and vacate the original stipulated judgment on the ground that the judgment was unconstitutional in that defendant did not have representation of counsel in entering into the stipulation. The trial court denied the motion and defendant appealed. The reviewing court reversed, holding that the judgment was void because defendant did not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waive her right to counsel and to trial. The court held that a stipulated judgment in a civil action under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 11350 required a judicial determination of the validity of any constitutional waiver. The court held that the appeal was permissible pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 904.1(b). The court held that defendant was not guilty of laches and plaintiff claimed no prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant sought review of a judgment by the Superior Court of Fresno County (California), which, following a jury trial, found defendant guilty of false imprisonment, battery with serious bodily injury, and two counts of rape. Prior to trial, defendant made a Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995 motion to set aside the information, which was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995 motion to set aside the hybrid battery charge. Defendant argued that by waiting until after the preliminary hearing to charge the battery, a wobbler, the prosecution deprived appellant of a substantial right. Defendant also argued that the concurrent sentence for false imprisonment violated Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654 because the imprisonment was part and parcel of the rapes and thus the court should have stayed the sentence. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's arguments. The court held that the amendment of the information after the preliminary hearing to add the hybrid battery charge as a felony was proper and that defendant was not denied a substantial right at the preliminary examination. The court also found that the false imprisonment was not incidental to the rapes. However, the court held that the trial court should have stated reasons for consecutively sentencing appellant for the second rape. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction but remanded the matter to the trial court for resentencing on the second rape count.</SPAN></P>

The court first explained that although each member of the court was financially interested in the outcome, because there was no other judge or court available to hear and resolve the cause necessity required that the judges not be disqualified on the ground of conflict of interest. The court held that Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 4, as amended, was ineffective as applied to the &quot;protected&quot; class of judges because it was in derogation of the contract clause of the federal constitutional and in derogation of the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner abortion groups' original petition for a writ of mandate filed with the California Supreme Court was remanded, and petitioners sought to compel respondent governmental officials to refrain from enforcing 1981 Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The legislature attempted to restrict abortion funding by specifying that none of the funds appropriated for the Medi-Cal Act (Act), Cal.

Stat. ch. 99, &sect; 2, items 426-101-001 through 426-101-890, provision 27. The appellate court issued a peremptory writ that directed respondent governmental officials to refrain from enforcing the restriction on funding abortions. The appellate court relied upon the two prior supreme court decisions, which held the identical restrictions unconstitutional in observing that once California decided to provide medical benefits to the poor, it could not selectively withdraw part of that care because a women exercised her constitutional right to choose to have an abortion. The separation of powers doctrine did not preclude the judiciary from ordering funds already appropriated for general health services under the Act, within which abortions fell, to be paid without regard to the invalid legislative restriction. Petitioner abortion groups were entitled to attorney fees under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1021.5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate, as sought by petitioner abortion groups, which directed respondent governmental officials to refrain from enforcing the restrictions on funding of abortions under the Medi-Cal Act within the 1981 Budget Act because those restrictions were unconstitutional. The writ, which directed that already appropriated funds be used to pay for abortions, did not violate the separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied plaintiff's peremptory writ seeking reinstatement finding that substantial evidence supported defendant's decision not to reinstate. Plaintiff sought review.

In order to obtain such assistance plaintiff entered into an arbitration agreement with defendant.

In response, plaintiff filed a complaint for declaratory relief, an injunction, a temporary restraining order, and a preliminary injunction, asserting it could not be compelled to submit to arbitration. Defendant filed a cross-complaint to compel arbitration. The trial court denied a request for a preliminary injunction to prevent arbitration, granted the motion to compel arbitration, and stayed the issues of the complaint pending arbitration.

Appellant contended that good cause for voluntarily leaving employment pursuant to Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code &sect; 1256 did not exist where respondent quit her job to join her fiance out of state. Appellant contended that, absent an existing or imminent marital relationship, there was no authority for holding good cause existed for leaving employment to join a boyfriend, fiance, or cohabitee. Respondent argued that to deny her benefits because she quit her job to move to another state with her fiance discriminated against her solely because of the relationship. The appellate court agreed and affirmed the peremptory writ of mandate because allowing respondent to receive benefits was not in derogation of the public policy to foster and promote the institution of marriage. The court held that the morals of society had changed so radically in regard to cohabitation that courts could not impose a standard based on moral considerations that had been so widely abandoned.</SPAN></P>

He filed suit under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.S. &sect; 688, and the general maritime law. The trial court found that appellant was a seaman, but that his only remedy was under the workers' compensation laws, and that the exclusive remedy of Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3601 created no material prejudice to the general maritime law or the Jones Act and did not interfere with the uniformity and harmony of that body of law. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment, holding that because appellant's employment was of a distinctly maritime nature, application of the exclusive remedy provision would materially prejudice the Jones Act and the general maritime law. The court further held that because respondent's activities were not of primarily local concern, as they affected interstate commerce and navigation, both the commerce power and the admiralty power supported application of the Jones Act and maritime law to respondent as appellant's employer.</SPAN></P>

Insofar as the judgment denied plaintiff's application for an injunction to terminate its exclusion from Leisure World, the judgment is reversed with directions.  The trial court is directed to enter a new and different judgment granting such application on terms and conditions substantially as follows: For so long as Golden Rain or any other entity, exercising a power of control over the right of entry into Leisure World, authorizes or suffers the unsolicited, live carrier delivery of any give-away type newspaper, including the Leisure World News, to any residence in Leisure World where any occupant thereof has not personally requested or subscribed to such delivery, the plaintiff shall be entitled to enter Leisure World for the purpose of delivering its newspaper, unsolicited, to any such residence in Leisure&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  World, provided nevertheless that such delivery shall be under the same rules and regulations as to time, place, and manner as apply to the delivery of e.g., the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers offered for sale to subscribers, and provided further that if any resident of Leisure World shall expressly state in writing to Golden Rain or to the management of Leisure World that he or she does not wish to receive unsolicited delivery of the Laguna News-Post to his or her residence, then plaintiff shall refrain thereafter from any delivery to that resident.  In this latter instance, plaintiff shall be entitled to verify independently by telephone call or personal visit that any given resident does not wish to receive unsolicited delivery of the Laguna News-Post.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because we have decided that plaintiff's exclusion from Leisure World was unconstitutional discrimination and therefore wrongful as a matter of law, the trial court is further directed, upon due application of plaintiff, to try, with a jury if requested, those issues of damages arising from the illegality of the exclusion of the Laguna News-Post from Leisure World, namely: (1) whether plaintiff suffered any damages caused&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by its illegal exclusion from Leisure World as measured by sections 1708 and 3333 of the Civil Code; (2) whether there was any concerted action or agreement between Golden Rain and Golden West, per section 16720, subdivision (a) of the Business and Professions Code, which caused the unconstitutional exclusion of the Laguna News-Post from Leisure World such as to constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade; and (3) whether there were any actual damages proximately resulting from any such unreasonable restraint of trade over the four years next preceding the filing of the action for assessment per section 16750.1 of the Business and Professions Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except as reversed with directions above, the judgment is affirmed, and each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff publisher and defendant foundation sought a second rehearing of an appeal in the Court of Appeal of California, Fourth Appellate District, Division Two. In its first rehearing, the appellate court upheld its decision in the original appeal that plaintiff was entitled to an injunction and a limited new trial on issues under the Cartwright Act. Plaintiff's action challenged defendant's exclusion of a newspaper from a walled community.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff sought to make unsolicited, live-carrier delivery of its giveaway newspaper to residents of a walled community. Defendant excluded plaintiff's newspaper from the community but allowed delivery of a similar unsolicited newspaper. Plaintiff sued defendant on constitutional and unfair trade grounds. The trial jury resolved the issues raised in the complaint against plaintiff. In the original appeal, the court reversed as to the constitutional claim and permitted a trial on damages. In the second rehearing of that appeal, the court decided that plaintiff's free speech, free-press rights secured under Cal. Const. art. I &sect; 2 were violated when defendant discriminatorily excluded plaintiff's unsolicited live-carrier delivery of its newspaper from the walled community. The court held that plaintiff was allowed to enter and make deliveries except to residents who expressed that they did not wish to receive the newspaper. The jury trial of issues arising under the Cartwright Act and the Unfair Trade Practices Act proceeded without recognition of the deprivation of plaintiff's constitutional rights. Thus, the trial court was directed to determine those issues and issues of damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Except as it reversed on constitutional grounds, the court affirmed the judgment of the superior court.

Appellant, now represented by counsel, contended that she signed the document even though she lacked the ability to make support payments because she was afraid that if she did not sign she would go to jail and lose her insurance license that she had just obtained. The appellate court reversed the order denying appellant's motion to set aside the judgment because as an indigent defendant in a prosecution for child support appellant was constitutionally entitled to appointment of free counsel pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 11350. The court held that the constitutional requirement of free counsel would become a nullity if respondent was allowed to circumvent the requirement by executing stipulated judgments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The order denying appellant's motion to set aside the stipulated judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded with directions to the lower court to allow appellant, properly represented by counsel, to file an answer to the complaint and have a trial on the issues. The court held that such a stipulated judgment, like a confession of judgment, was constitutional only if it constituted a valid waiver of appellant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The legislature enacted Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1026.5, limiting the maximum confinement of persons committed as criminally insane to the maximum term for the underlying offense and providing, for persons whose underlying offense was of a violent nature, a procedure for extension of confinement patterned after the mentally disordered sex offender act (MDSO) provision. Appellant county filed a petition for writ of mandate to compel reimbursement to it from respondent state for funds expended under &sect; 1026.5. The writ was denied, and appellant challenged the decision. Appellant argued that it was entitled to reimbursement based on Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 2207, which provided for reimbursement for costs incurred as a result of any law enacted after January 1, 1973, that mandated a new program or an increased level of service of an existing program. Respondent contended that &sect; 1026.5 did not increase any cost to the county. The reviewing court held that &sect; 1026.5 set forth an entirely new program for dealing with violent persons found guilty by reason of insanity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff corporation operated a lumber processing facility along the coastline. As required by the Coastal Act, Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 30000 et seq., appellant applied to defendant state coastal commission for permits to construct facilities on its property. Defendant granted the permits on the condition that plaintiff dedicate easements for public access to the shoreline. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court judgment was based on an erroneous interpretation of the term &quot;new development&quot; as used in Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 30212. Lacking a statutory definition of the words &quot;new&quot; or &quot;project&quot; for purposes of the Coastal Act, the court resorted to the usual and ordinary meaning. Thus, the court held that plaintiff did not have a right to construct new development in the coastal zone without a permit. Defendant could constitutionally require a dedication of property in the interests of the general welfare as a condition of permitting land development. The public access easements were reasonably related to a principal objective of the Coastal Act in Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 30001.5(c) to provide for maximum access to the coast by the public.</SPAN></P>

After many years, the prosecution filed a petition for extended commitment pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1026.5(b) and the trial court ordered appellant recommitted.

Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 1026.5(b) did not require a finding of amenability to treatment, and that the omission of this requirement was a valid exercise of the legislature's police power and did not impinge upon appellant's constitutional rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff county filed an action for declaratory relief to test the validity of the representative period designated by defendant State Board of Equalization for assessing nonscheduled aircraft for the 1980-1981 assessment year. The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, plaintiff argued defendant did not have statutory authority to modify the designated representative period; defendant's choice of a representative period constituted an abuse of discretion; and the modification unconstitutionally exempted property from ad valorem taxation. The court concluded that the legislature's intent to tax aircraft only to the extent they were normally present within the state reasonably implied a power to substitute periods of atypical and abnormal aircraft activity with equivalent periods of normal aircraft activity. The court held defendant did not abuse its discretion in using the time periods because the method was a reasonable attempt to pick a time period that is likely to reflect the average activity for the ensuing tax year. The court found defendant committed no unconstitutional exemption of property from taxation.</SPAN></P>

The court held that vaginal penetration was not necessary in order to constitute the crime of rape. Any penetration of the female genitalia by the penis, however slight, was sufficient and the evidence supported the jury's finding that defendant made actual sexual penetration and was guilty of rape. The court rejected defendant's contention that the California sentencing scheme for violent sexual offenses constituted cruel and unusual punishment in view of the outrageous nature of violent sexual offenses and the manifest danger to society from recidivism and multiplicity of offenses. The court concluded that the California sentencing scheme for violent sexual offenses did not violate equal protection of the law because violent sex offenders were not similarly situated with other offenders.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The prosecution appealed an order dismissing a charge that defendant had sold a narcotic in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11352, following the trial court's affirmative finding of his guilt. Defendant argued that the order from which the prosecution appealed was a nonappealable order. The trial court held that there was a discriminatory prosecution. On appeal, the court held that whether an order was appealable depended on the effect of the ruling sought to be reviewed; it was to be determined not by form but by substance. The court held that the order was in legal effect an order arresting judgment, from which an appeal was expressly permitted by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1238(a)(4). The appellate court held that there were no authorities to indicate that the court could arbitrarily dismiss the action. The judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 1538.5 made no provisions for the people to have appealed the grant of a motion to suppress evidence by a magistrate in a felony case, the appeal of a dismissal under &sect; 871.5 was proper. The court held that appellant was entitled to a superior court review of the magistrate's dismissal order and entitled to appeal the superior court's denial of appellant's motion to reinstate the complaint. The court held that the motion to suppress was proper because there was a warrantless helicopter overflight of defendant's property, and the intrusion could not be justified by the doctrine of exigent circumstances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff attorney referred a case to a medical malpractice specialist. The two agreed to divide any legal fees received. After this agreement was made, the Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 2-108 was enacted, which prohibited such agreements. The specialist was unable to handle the case, and defendant attorney agreed to take the case and honor the fee arrangement. Defendant subsequently had the agreement voided on public policy grounds. The court reversed the judgment, however, finding that when made, the bargain was not void. In determining whether the subject of the given contract violated public policy, the court looked to the state of the law as it existed at the time the contract was made. The relevant time was not when defendant succeeded to the rights and obligations of the contract, but related back to its making. The court also noted that the prohibition against such agreements was lifted within just a few years after it was declared. As fee splitting arrangements continued to abound with the apparent approval of the legislature and the state bar, justice was better served by having defendant bound by his word than by depriving plaintiff of his part of the gross fee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Judgment reversed with instructions to enter judgment for plaintiff against defendants Wesley H. Harris and Wesley H. Harris, a professional corporation, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"><SUP>6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the sum of $ 88,952.59. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"><SUP>7</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c9">6&nbsp;In his petition for rehearing, Harris asserts that a reversal with directions to enter judgment against him is inappropriate since he pleaded an additional affirmative defense which the trial court did not rule upon.  His third affirmative defense alleged: &quot;[Any] performance due and owing to the plaintiff by this defendant, predicated upon the contract alleged in plaintiff's complaint, was and is excused by operation of law in that subsequent to the alleged date of the alleged agreement, the conduct which forms the basis of the alleged agreement was declared unlawful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">In essence, Harris explains, his claim is that rule 2-108 as currently drafted operates as a supervening prohibition to excuse nonperformance.  (See Rest.2d Contracts, &sect; 264; Calamari &amp; Perillo, Contracts (2d ed. 1977) &sect; 13-4, p. 486.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">The problem with Harris' argument is that application of the doctrine of supervening prohibition presumes a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">legal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> conclusion that performance of the contract would be contrary to the newly enacted statute or regulation.  As we have already noted, the general rule is that a subsequent change in the law will not render unenforceable a previously created contractual right.  (See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">ante</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">, p. 918.) A well-established corollary to the rule states that, &quot;a statute is presumed to be prospective only in operation and will not be retroactively applied unless such intention clearly appears from the language of the statute itself.  [Citations.]&quot; ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Whitmire </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16"> H. K. Ferguson Co., supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">, 261 Cal.App.2d at p. 602.) Both this court and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Altschul</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> court (see 83 Cal.App.3d 153, 163) accepted the proposition that rule 22 did not operate retroactively to invalidate contracts entered into before November 1972.  A similar conclusion must also hold true with respect to the current draft of rule 2-108.  (See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">ante</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">, fn. 2.) Thus, the legal premise for application of Harris' third affirmative defense is simply not present: Performance of the contract has not been made impossible by the enactment of rule 2-108.  Consequently, there is no need to remand to the trial court for any additional factual inquiry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner district had sought for writs of mandate against respondent county when it did not levy and collect a special assessment used for water projects as required by Cal. Water Code &sect;&sect; 12878.25 to 12878.39 and the American River Flood Control District Act, 1927 Cal. Stat. 808. Respondent contended it did not collect the assessment because the assessment violated Cal. Const. art.

Petitioner needed the special assessment monies as its reserves for maintenance were nearly exhausted. The court noted a special assessment was imposed for the public benefit, but in reality it was a compulsory charge to recoup the cost of a public improvement. The court held that respondent had to collect the requested assessments because the plain language of the statutes required them to do so, and that the California Constitution did not change the county's obligation to collect the special assessment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondents, division of medical quality and board of medical quality assurance, charged appellant doctor with acts involving dishonesty and falsification of medical records. The administrative law judge denied appellant's motion to exclude medical records, and appellant filed a petition for writ of mandate. The trial court issued a writ of mandate finding hospital charts admissible and office charts inadmissible. Appellant sought review of the judgment regarding the admissibility of hospital records, and respondents cross-appealed the judgment regarding the inadmissibility of office medical charts. The court affirmed the judgment as to the admissibility of the hospital records and reversed as to the inadmissibility of the office medical records. The court held that the trial court gave careful consideration to the evidence and correctly concluded that a case which held that administrative agencies were not exempt from supporting their subpoenas with adequate declarations was not to be given retroactive application. The court further held that it found insufficient grounds for extending the exclusionary rule from criminal cases to the administrative investigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the judgment insofar as it held the hospital records admissible and reversed the judgment insofar as it held the office medical records inadmissible in evidence, with instructions to the trial court to enter judgment in accord with its opinions. In balancing the interests and various concerns involved, the court concluded that the scales were weighted heavily against the application of the exclusionary rule in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants were charged with the crime of murder ( Cal. Penal Code, &sect; 187), by information filed on December 1, 1980. After the effective date of the amendment to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1387 one month later, defendants moved to dismiss pursuant to that section, asserting that a prior dismissal of the charges under Cal.

The People appealed, contending that the amendment to &sect;1387 could not apply to dismissal prior to its effective date. The court reversed the orders of dismissal, holding that a dismissal under &sect; 995 operated as a bar to further prosecution only where the dismissal occurred after the effective date of the amendment of &sect; 1387, which gave it that effect. The court stated that the construction of the amendment of &sect; 1387 urged by defendants defeated the fundamental notions of fairness and disregard entirely the reliance of the superior court on the former procedural rules at the time it granted defendants' motion for dismissal, as the superior court made it abundantly clear it was relying upon the People's right to refile the charges.</SPAN></P>

Real party filed a lawsuit to enjoin petitioners from using their property, arguing that the proposed use violated the single-family residential purpose restriction.

Respondent trial court determined that petitioners' activities violated the injunction previously issued pursuant to the stipulated judgment and concluded that recently passed legislation had no effect on the injunction. On appeal, the court held that respondent abused its discretion in failing to modify the injunction to allow petitioners to use their property as a nursing home. The court stated that respondent had the inherent power to modify the injunction where changes rendered such action just and equitable. The court found that, in light of broad social changes, the covenant which the injunction purported to enforce could not prohibit operation of petitioners' nursing home.

The court held that it was not the complaint but the totality of the evidence produced at the preliminary hearing which notified appellant of the potential charges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Riverside County (California), which convicted him of first-degree murder with special circumstances, robbery, firearm offenses, attempted murder, burglary, unlawful taking of a car, and receiving stolen property and sentenced him to life in prison without parole. Defendant argued that the urgency clause of 1977 Cal. Stat. 316, &sect; 26, under which he was convicted, was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder with special circumstances, robbery, firearm offenses, attempted murder, burglary, unlawful taking of a vehicle, and receiving stolen property and was sentenced to life without parole. The court affirmed the judgment except that it stayed execution of the sentences for the unlawful taking and firearm counts because they violated the multiple punishment proscription of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654. The investigatory stop was not rendered improper merely because it was later determined that no actual parking violation occurred. The car search was justified by the detection of a marijuana odor. Severance of the attempted murder charge was properly denied because the modus operandi was so similar to that of the murder charge that the probative value of admitting evidence of one in a trial for the other outweighed the prejudicial effect. A special circumstance finding was proper because the robbery was not merely incidental to the murder. The urgency clause of 1977 Cal. Stat. 316, &sect; 26, under which defendant was convicted and sentenced, was valid because Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 27 did not require that it be subject to a referendum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant nonresident seller appealed from an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which denied a motion to quash a prejudgment writ of attachment on real property and which continued the attachment in favor of plaintiff buyer based upon the determination that the sale arose out of the defendant's conduct of a trade, business, or profession pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 483.010(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant nonresident seller, as a part of a move to Mexico, sold real property that she and her husband, before his death, had held as joint tenants for most of their adult lives. Plaintiff buyer filed a complaint that alleged breach of contract for sale of property and also obtained an order for issuance of writ of attachment for a nonresident under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 492.010, pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 485.210. Defendant filed an answer and a motion to set aside the attachment order so as to release the attached property, but the motion was denied. On appeal the court reversed. The attachment order had to be set aside once defendant filed a general appearance unless plaintiff showed that his right to attachment was authorized under a provision other than &sect; 492.010. Under the ordinary attachment procedure contained in Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 483.010(c), plaintiff failed to prove defendant sold the real property as part of a trade, business, or profession, because the sale of a personal real estate parcel that defendant and her husband had held for 30 years could not have arisen out of the business of being a broker but rather was strictly for her own account.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the order that granted plaintiff buyer a continuance of a prejudgment writ of attachment on defendant nonresident seller's real property. Plaintiff failed to prove that the sale of the real property arose out of defendant's conduct of a trade, business or profession and therefore rendered improper the continuance of the writ of attachment.</SPAN></P>

Respondents argued that the judgment of dismissal should be affirmed on the grounds of estoppel, failure to pursue grievance procedures, and lack of discriminatory motive. Respondents contended that appellants were estopped from repudiating a commitment to which they had agreed. The court held that the alleged acquiescence of appellants had a bearing on the question of a remedy but it was a matter for the trial court to determine on remand. Respondents contended appellants were barred by their failure to pursue the grievance procedure.

The trial court granted the petition and appellant sought review, contending a denial of due process stemming from failure to notify appellant of the legal consequences flowing from the minor's placement in a foster home; that respondent failed to meet its burden of proof under &sect; 232(a)(7); and that the trial court erred in failing to consider alternatives to termination, or at least in continuing appellant's visitation rights. In this latter contention, appellant challenged the constitutionality of the statutory scheme insofar as it precluded continuation of visitation rights after termination. The court affirmed because notification was not required, respondent's evidence was sufficient, and the trial court did not err because complete termination was the essence of &sect; 232.

Respondent trial court denied petitioners' request and petitioners filed a petition for writ of mandate to compel injunctive relief. Upon review, the court granted the writ of mandate and ordered respondent court to issue the injunction. The court held that the ordinances, which required sexually explicit materials to either be sealed or placed beyond the reach of minors, were overbroad because such requirements would also place the materials out of the view of adults who had the right to view them. The ordinances also gave merchants the option to exclude minors who were unaccompanied by parents. The court held that the attempt to exclude minors from retail establishments that sell a variety of other literature and other regular goods, was unconstitutional. The court also held that the ordinances had a chilling effect on petitioners' U.S. Const. amend. I, exercise of free speech.

Defendant was turned over to immigration for deportation. If he was not deported, he was to present himself for sentencing. Defendant's probation was revoked because he made threatening telephone calls and failed to either leave the United States or present himself for sentencing. The court affirmed the judgment that revoked defendant's probation. The court held that defendant failed to present substantial evidence that would have compelled the trial court to hold a hearing on his competence to stand trial. The court also held that defendant's probation could be revoked for subsequently committed offenses regardless of whether defendant had been prosecuted for them, because the standard of proof in the two proceedings was different. Further, there was no reasonable basis for concluding that the trial court punished defendant for contesting the hearing since there was evidence presented that defendant was dangerous. Finally, as a term of his plea bargain, defendant waived his right under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 2900.5 to credit for the time served in the county jail.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed a writ of mandate challenging the validity of the ordinance. The trial court denied his request for a peremptory writ and appellant sought review on the grounds that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it caused him to lose his vested right to operate an adult entertainment business in existence before the ordinance was enacted. The court affirmed, holding that zoning legislation may validly provide for the eventual termination of nonconforming property uses without compensation if it provides a reasonable amortization period commensurate with the investment involved. Appellant had the burden of establishing the unreasonableness of the period as applied to his vested right, which he did not meet.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">California voters adopted Cal. Const. art. XIII A, which allowed cities to impose special taxes. Defendant city adopted Beverly Hills, Cal., Ordinance 1697, which increased business license taxes.

Beverly Hills, Cal., Ordinance 1717 did not change the amount of taxes. Plaintiff business owners filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinances. The trial court found the ordinances were constitutional. Plaintiffs appealed.  Cal.

After they entered the house, they stabbed the victim and stole her belongings. Defendant was charged and found guilty of first degree murder, robbery, burglary, auto theft, escape from a youth facility and destroying evidence. Defendant challenged his conviction, arguing that he was not given proper Miranda warnings. The court reversed the conviction, stating that the Miranda warnings violated federal law. Plaintiff State of California appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which held the Miranda warnings was adequate under federal law, and remanded. On remand, the court determined that the Miranda warnings did not violate state law, and that his confession was freely given. The court also determined that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, and that the prosecutor did not commit misconduct during closing arguments. However, the court modified defendant's sentence to life imprisonment, rather than death, due to his age, and reversed the count for destroying evidence, as defendant did not destroy the evidence while there was an investigation of his crime.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Code &sect; 1950.5(i) and from failing to refund the fee within the statutory period in violation of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1950.5(e). Defendants contended they were denied due process because the relief granted exceeded the state's request in its notice of motion for preliminary injunction for relief with respect to the assessment and not the refund, and that the trial court erred in applying the statute to a fee for entering a lease, instead of limiting it to payments used to secure the performance of conditions of the lease. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that defendants failed to produce a record on appeal that would allow the court to determine whether the defect in the notice was waived at the hearing in the trial court and thus it presumed the validity of the trial court's order. The court held that the &quot;rental fee&quot; was a &quot;security&quot; for purposes of the statute whose broad language clearly proscribed the assessment of a nonrefundable &quot;payment&quot; for a &quot;any purpose.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Respondent appealed unsuccessfully to the board of corrections, and then filed a habeas corpus petition with the lower court, which was granted. Appellants sought review.

The court held that &sect; 723(a) of the Department of Corrections Administrative Manual, as applied by appellants to deny publication of the cartoon and photograph, was unconstitutional and contrary to statutory mandate, because it unjustifiably imposed limitations upon legitimate rights of prisoners. The materials did not so threaten prison discipline or other legitimate prison interests as to justify the deprivation of the First Amendment rights of inmates. The court concluded that censorship of the materials violated respondent's free speech rights, was prohibited by Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant was originally charged with assault with a deadly weapon and burglary. Prior to a readiness conference, appellant was told that state intended to file an amended information charging more serious crimes and enhancing allegations.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the plea bargaining process was a valid part of the criminal justice system that did not offend appellant's due process rights. Plea bargains were a necessity to the functioning of the system. The court held that there was no error when the trial court denied a lineup requested by appellant because nothing was presented to suggest that there was any identification problem.

On review, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that there was sufficient evidence at the preliminary hearing in the form of eyewitness testimony and positive identification for the trial judge to form reasonable suspicion that appellant committed the crimes charged. The court also held that the trial court did not err in refusing to sever his charges, because all of the crimes contained a common element of substantial importance and were properly joined. Further, the court maintained that the trial court did not err in sentencing appellant to life imprisonment, because the court properly imposed the only sentence that was available to him as a minor for the offense of murder under Cal.

The court reversed and held that appellant's pretermination hearing did not fulfill minimum constitutional due process requirements, and that respondent never assumed the burden of proving the charges against appellant in the post-termination hearing. Appellant was not provided with a copy of materials upon which his termination was based and was not accorded a right to respond thereto.

Defendant city council sustained the defendant planning commission's denial of the request on appeal. The trial court granted plaintiffs' writ of mandate pursuant to Cal. Code Civ.

The trial court erroneously concluded that defendant city was estopped as a matter of law from denying the variance because the city was aware of the merger, restrictions and variances which had been granted to the previous single ownership.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The people appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Contra Costa County (California), dismissing a charge against defendant offender for selling narcotics in violation of Cal.

The people asserted the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion to arrest judgment and dismiss and in not pronouncing judgment following the trial court's guilty finding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant offender was found guilty following a bench trial of selling a narcotic in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11352. The trial court subsequently dismissed defendant's case finding defendant had suffered a discriminatory prosecution as a result of conduct by a police officer which in effect suppressed evidence from the prosecutor. The court reversed the judgment of dismissal holding that the trial court had erred in not denying the motion to arrest judgment and to dismiss and had erred in not appointing a time for pronouncement of judgment or determining a motion for probation as required by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1191. The court noted that following a conviction, the trial court had no discretion but to pronounce sentence or to grant probation and because the trial court's error only occurred following the unquestioned judicial finding of guilt, there would be no second trial but the case was remanded to the trial court for pronouncement of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the trial court orders arresting the judgment and the judgment of dismissal finding that the trial court abused its discretion because upon conviction, the trial court only had the discretion to either pronounce sentence or grant lawful probation. The case was remanded back to the trial court for pronouncement of judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed an order from the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), that resentenced defendant after determining an error had been made in computing the original sentence. Defendant asserted that the trial court lacked jurisdiction upon resentencing under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170(d) and the court had no power to impose a greater sentence than initially pronounced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was originally charged with 19 counts of robbery or attempted robbery with enhanced allegations of use of a firearm or deadly weapon. Defendant entered a guilty plea agreement stipulating that defendant's maximum prison term would be nine years, eight months. The trial court originally sentenced defendant to nine years, eight months but upon hearing resentenced defendant changing the disposition of count 9 from concurrent to consecutive. Defendant claimed this had the effect of imposing a greater sentence. The court affirmed the judgment holding that a prohibition against imposing a greater sentence did apply to a sentence enhanced by running multiple terms consecutively where the original sentence provided for concurrent terms. However, the court noted the prohibition did not apply to resentencing occasioned by an error of law in the first sentencing procedure where the enhancement of subordinate terms resulted in an &quot;unauthorized&quot; sentence or a sentence which utilized an unavailable ground for enhancement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court holding that the trial court was not bound by the limits of the term originally imposed upon defendant because the prohibition against imposing a greater sentence on resentencing did not apply when resentencing was required due to an error of law during the first sentencing procedure which resulted in an unauthorized sentence.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner asserted that the guidelines were unconstitutional and contrary to statutory law. Petitioner also contended that he had authority from the legislative intent in the progressive expansion of the duties of the public defender. The court held that petitioner's duty arose from statute upon court appointment or request by the defendant; the private attorney's duty arose from the contractual undertaking of representation. The court reasoned that the authority of the public defender was limited by law to act in a representative capacity upon request or order of the court, or request of a particular defendant under specified circumstances, and therefore petitioner could not proceed in his official capacity, on his own initiative, to raise issues detached from the representation of a particular defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff landowner requested and was denied by defendant city of Palmdale, California, a change in zoning for his land to commercial planned development. The property was situated in a zone designated for agricultural and open land uses, but also permitted uses such as one-family dwellings, animal hospitals, schools, kennels, and veterinary offices. Plaintiff brought an action alleging that the denial of zone change amounted to a taking without just compensation in violation of U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV. The trial court entered judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend in favor of defendant. The court affirmed, holding that plaintiff had failed to show that the refusal to rezone his property was a taking of property. The health and welfare of defendant's citizens were well served by maintaining open land in the vicinity of the airport, and therefore the refusal to rezone was a reasonable exercise of police power. Moreover, the mere diminution in value of property did not amount to a deprivation of all reasonable or economically viable uses. The court noted that the zoning ordinance permitted any number of uses valuable and essential to a diversified community economy.</SPAN></P>

The refusal was a reasonable exercise of police power, and did not deprive plaintiff of all economically viable uses, as the zone in which it was situated allowed a variety of valuable uses.</SPAN></P>

Defendants Los Angeles County and the California Board of Equalization appealed, contending that the trial court erred in holding &sect; 214.02 constitutional in that the legislature exceeded the authority to exempt property from taxation granted by Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner brought a petition for a writ of mandate from an order of the trial court (California) permitting the disclosure of citizens' complaints in the personnel file of the police officer who arrested real parties in interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Real parties in interest were arrested, and they sought the disclosure of the arresting officer's personnel file relating to the use of excessive force, racial/ethnic prejudice, or false arrest, for the period of his employment with petitioner, a city and county. The trial court ordered disclosure of the information, and petitioner brought a petition for a writ of mandate, arguing that the order violated Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1045, which excluded from disclosure to any litigant information consisting of complaints concerning conduct of a peace officer occurring more than five years before the event or transaction which was the subject of the litigation in aid of which discovery or disclosure was sought. The court ruled that when the right to disclosure of information conflicted with the constitutional right of privacy, there must be a careful balancing of the compelling public need for discovery against the fundamental right of privacy. The court granted the petition, concluding that &sect; 1045 was reasonably necessary to balance the competing public interests in preserving an individual's privacy and in facilitating the ascertainment of truth in judicial proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petition for a writ of mandate was granted, and the order of the trial court was vacated, where the legislature did not violate due process so long as an enactment was procedurally fair and reasonably related to a proper legislative goal, and the cutoff period of the statute excluding the disclosure of information related to a peace officer's conduct carefully and properly balanced the competing state interests of privacy and disclosure.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance essentially regulated the display to minors of drug paraphernalia for sale. The injunction had been sought by respondent corporation and others and had been granted primarily on the ground that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The court reversed the order granting the injunction, as the order enjoining enforcement of the ordinance was error. The ordinance, consistent with a similar ordinance that had been sustained in another case, defined the paraphernalia by the manner in which it was displayed and the proscribed devices were limited by the context to devices being sold or displayed for sale for the purpose of smoking or otherwise using the specified drugs.

The trial court found in respondent's favor, and appellants, city, retirement fund, and board of administration, sought review. The court affirmed, finding that the language of appellant city's charter and ordinance did not authorize the increased rates of contribution. The court found that the percentage contributed by respondent's members depended on their age when they became members and was to remain unchanged, except on change in benefits or upon increased fund earnings. The court found that appellant city agreed to contribute an amount &quot;sufficient&quot; to make up the retirement allowance that might be somewhat greater than the employee contribution and that appellant retirement fund's integrity was not endangered by the court's construction of the charter and ordinances. The court determined that vested contractual rights applied only to respondent's members employed before July 1, 1978, and that appellant city could change the rate for those employed thereafter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant union challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Barbara County (California), which denied appellant's petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition to restrain respondents, city, administrator and employee relations officer, from holding an election of city employees to determine whether appellant union or real party in interest, respondent association, would represent them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant union was the exclusive bargaining representative of respondent city's employees. Respondent association sought a decertification election to create two new bargaining units, and respondent employee relations officer granted its request for an election. The trial court denied appellant's petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition, and the court of appeal denied appellant's petition for a writ of supersedeas. The election was held; appellant was decertified as to the two new units and sought review. The court affirmed, holding that imposition of a three-year contract bar doctrine would constitute an invasion of a legislative prerogative. By consulting with appellant's predecessors on the intent of Santa Barbara, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 3.12, respondent city fully complied with the requirements of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 3507.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant mentally retarded patients were committed. At the expiration of their initial commitment periods, the trial court entered temporary hold orders preventing their release. Appellants sought review of the ensuing recommitment orders, asserting the interim hold orders violated their due process and equal protection rights under Cal. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7. Though the claims were moot, the court found no equal protection violation because the statutory distinction between mentally ill and retarded individuals was reasonable. After examining appellants' private liberty and dignitary interests, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of liberty, and the public interest in appellants' continuing confinement, the court found that appellants were not deprived of due process. Although an adversarial probable cause hearing was not required before a continued detention order was issued, appellants were entitled to respond to the grounds for the order. As appellants received such opportunity, their constitutional claims were rejected. The court also rejected appellants' claim that they were entitled to credit for the time they were held, and affirmed the commitment orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Commitment orders were affirmed because appellant mentally retarded patients' constitutional claims were moot and appellants were not entitled to credit for time served. Regardless of mootness, the court determined that appellants were only entitled to respond to the grounds for continuing commitment orders, and were not entitled to adversarial probable cause hearings; further, appellants' equal protection claims were deemed meritless.</SPAN></P>

The court also denied the writ as to the testing of physical evidence. The court held that the trial court's order regarding testing, although it placed limits on the time and place, did not undermine his right to test the evidence.

Respondent school district and superintendent of the school district asserted that their actions were consistent with the requirements of &sect; 44942 because the statute did not expressly define the nature and scope of the psychiatric examination of the employee. The court held that the lack of an express written finding by the psychiatric panel, within the requisite statutory time, that appellant was suffering from mental illness of such a degree as to render him incompetent to perform his duties should have been treated by the board as a finding that the employee was not suffering from such mental illness and, in fact, a conclusion that the employee be permitted to return to his duties.

The court affirmed the order of the Worker's Compensation Appeals Board dismissing the action. The court determined that although the relationship between the petitioner and insurer was contractual in origin, law established the scope of the insurer's liability. The court concluded that the provision to which the petitioner objected was simply a repeal of a provision allowing the petitioner to seek contribution from a prior insurer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff, publisher of a give-away newspaper, filed a complaint against defendant, owner of common areas within a private, residential, walled community where only resident-approved access was permitted through guarded security gates, when plaintiff was denied entry for unsolicited, free delivery to the residents of its paper. Another similar paper was given exclusive access to the community. After trial, the jury resolved the issues against plaintiff. On appeal the court reversed, holding that plaintiff's exclusion from the community was unconstitutional discrimination. The court held that defendant, acting with the implicit sanction of the state's police power behind it, discriminated against the free speech and free press rights of plaintiff by excluding it from the community after defendant permitted the unsolicited delivery of plaintiff's competitor to the residents of the community. The court directed the trial court to try the issue of damages arising from the illegality of the exclusion, including whether there was concerted activity in violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 16720(a), and whether there were any actual damages proximately resulting from such exclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs, initiative proponents, sought to qualify an initiative for placement on a general election ballot.

The trial court entered judgment for defendants, and plaintiffs sought review. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that because &sect; 29770 was adopted for a proper legislative purpose, to preserve the privacy of persons signing petitions, rather than to impede the initiative process, it was properly examined under a balancing test, and that it had only an incidental effect upon plaintiffs' rights under U.S. Const. amends.

Code &sect; 621, he was not precluded from introducing the results of a blood test, which proved that he was not the biological father of the minor child. The court affirmed the order of the lower court holding that the 2-year statute of limitations contained in &sect; 621 had expired because it had been more that 2 years since the birth of the 12-year-old child. The court further held that appellant's rights under the equal protection clause were not violated by the exclusion of the test results because there had been no unequal treatment of men who sought to introduce similar evidence after the expiration of the statute of limitations and that the admission of such evidence after the running of the statute would contravene the policies behind the enactment of &sect; 621.</SPAN></P>

The named employees were properly dismissed because the development lender's release insulated its employees. The lawsuits arose out of appellants landowners' sale of 32 acres of land to respondent financial corporation and subsidiaries for development purposes in which appellants subordinated their loan to a subsequent deed of trust which was foreclosed on and shortly resold when development plans and financing fell apart.

The court held that although it had been held that a non-English-speaking defendant's U.S. Const. amend. XIV rights were satisfied if he was represented by counsel who was qualified to act as his interpreter, in California, with the right to an interpreter having been guaranteed in the Constitution, the right to an interpreter could not validly be waived without an affirmative showing on the record of a waiver which was intelligent and voluntary on the part of the defendant.

The trial court granted summary judgment to respondent architect because the action was barred by the statute of limitations under Cal.  Civ.

The court affirmed, because even though appellant could argue the unconstitutionality of &sect; 337.1 because the ruling adversely affected appellant's right to pursue a cause of action against respondent architect, &sect; 337.1 promoted a legitimate state interest by protecting contractors from uncertain future liability, and a rational basis existed for the classifications created by &sect; 337.1. The court held that Cal. Labor Code &sect; 6304.5 stated that statutes proposed by appellant were not admissible in any third party actions by an employee. The court held that negligence per se had not been established because there was no showing of unsatisfactory maintenance of the building by respondent building owners, nor did the peculiar risk doctrine apply because the accident resulted from the &quot;collateral negligence&quot; of a coworker.</SPAN></P>

Respondent's first EIR was rejected as not being in compliance with CEQA, and respondent submitted a second EIR by way of a return to the writ, to which petitioner county objected on the grounds that it failed to provide an accurate, stable, and finite project description, and that it failed to provide reasonable alternatives to the project. The court sustained petitioner's objections and held that where the EIR removed the availability of surface water from examination, it failed to fulfill the mandate of the court to provide an informed analysis of the project and its impact. The court also held that the establishment of a &quot;no-project&quot; alternative, which was predicated upon conditions different than those which preceded the project, distorted the relation of the project to the export of water to respondent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellants, teachers and other professionals, sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Yolo County (California), which sustained a demurrer without leave to amend based on the failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the Educational Employment Relations Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 3540-3549.3, and dismissed the action, in favor of respondent bargaining representative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellants, teachers and other professionals, contested a provision in a collective bargaining agreement that required professionals who were not members of respondent bargaining representative to either become a member or to pay a representation fee. Appellants claimed that their substantive grievances did not constitute unfair practices as defined by the Educational Employment Relations Act (Act), Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 3540-3549.3, and, therefore, were beyond the Public Employment Relations Board's (board) jurisdiction. The court sustained the demurrer and affirmed the dismissal of the action. The court held that the board was not limited to only investigating charges that were defined as &quot;unlawful&quot; under Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 3543.5, 3543.6, but had the power to make determinations with respect to charges or violations that were necessary to effectuate the Act's policies under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 3541.3(h)(i),(j),(n). The court found that appellants were still required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to a constitutional challenge because there was a reasonable probability a board ruling on the nonconstitutional issues would obviate the necessity of a constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the demurrer without leave to amend and the dismissed of the action, in favor of respondent bargaining representative. The court held that pursuant to the Education Employment Relations Act, the Public Employment Relations Board was invested with the initial jurisdiction over remedies to grievances that were alleged by appellants, teachers and other professionals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant heir sought review of the order of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which dismissed his complaint after granting respondent State of California's demurrer in an action seeking recovery for appellant and others similarly situated whose share of escheated funds was reduced by interest on the recovered inheritance tax under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 14211 and Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 14211.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The cash assets of an intestate decedent escheated to, and were deposited with, respondent state under Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 231 and Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1313. When a previously unknown heir successfully petitioned for a share of these funds, the court order deducted inheritance taxes and interest under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 14211 and Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 14211. Appellant heir sought recovery of the interest for himself and all others similarly situated. The trial court granted respondent's demurrer and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court reversed because there was no rational purpose for imposing interest on funds that were under respondent's control and generating income for it where respondent state was not deprived of either the beneficial use or income from monies properly owed to it. The court held that the term interest in Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 14211 was the same as in Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1915. The court held that appellant had not impermissibly split his cause of action because the suit was not trivial, the issue could not have been foreseen, and the motion to certify as a class action should have been determined in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant city challenged an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which denied appellant's request to enjoin respondents, adult bookstore operators, from operating their business, which appellant alleged involved the operation of a penny arcade in violation of Los Angeles, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 12.16. Appellant also sought review of the trial court's preliminary injunction restraining arrests for violation of &sect; 12.16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondents, adult bookstore operators, operated motion picture preview booths on the premises of their business. Appellant's action seeking to enjoin the operation of respondents' business on the ground that it violated Los Angeles, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 12.16's prohibition against penny arcades was denied by the trial court. The trial court issued a preliminary injunction restraining any arrests for violations of the ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed both orders because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering which party would suffer the greater injury and which party would probably prevail on the merits. The court found that the trial court properly preserved the status quo until factual issues about whether respondents violated the ordinance could be resolved. The trial court orders were proper because there was no evidence of actual interim harm to the public which would justify invoking the injunction to enjoin the business, but potential abridgment of respondents' U.S. Const. amend. I free speech rights warranted injunctive relief against enforcement of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the orders, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to enjoin respondents, adult bookstore operators, from continuing their business or by prohibiting future arrests for violations of the penny arcade ordinance because it was unclear whether respondents violated the ordinance and enforcement of the ordinance could abridge respondents' First Amendment rights and irreparably injure their business.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Code &sect; 232. Previously, pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.  &sect; 600 the minor was adjudicated dependent because appellant was a heroin addict and the minor was born addicted to heroin. The court found that &sect; 232 was not unconstitutionally vague because the words &quot;cruel or neglectful&quot; had been defined in past cases, encyclopedias, and law dictionaries and the definitions were understandable and definite. The court determined that the decision of the trial court, when supported by substantial evidence, was binding upon the court. The court reasoned that because the minor child had never known a home with appellant, and appellant never attempted to see the child, the trial judge properly found appellant neglected the minor from birth. Last, the court held the proper standard of proof to be applied in a &sect; 232 proceeding was a showing of clear and convincing evidence, as used by the trial court. Thus, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and did not examine petitioners' contentions because they would not affect the outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant state controller sought review of an order from the Superior Court of Los Angeles (California), which granted plaintiff surviving spouses a declaratory judgment to require payment for life of their allowances, even though the provisions of Judges' Retirement Law, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 75000 et. seq., that authorized their allowances had specified termination of such allowances upon plaintiffs' remarriage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In the proceeding below, plaintiff surviving spouses had obtained a declaratory judgment in their favor on the basis of their argument that the provisions of the Judges' Retirement Law, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 75000 et. seq., which terminated plaintiffs' allowances upon remarriage constituted an invalid restraint or marriage and a denial of constitutional equal protection and due process protections. On review, the court disagreed and reversed. The court found that the prospective loss of a spousal allowance upon the remarriage of the surviving partner was a reasonable regulation that did not interfere, significantly or legally, with the right to marry. The court also rejected plaintiffs' equal protection and due process arguments because the legislative classification in question met the test of reasonableness and bore a rational relation to a constitutionally permissible objective. The court concluded by acknowledging that the termination of the spousal allowance was appropriate where the bulk of California legislation dealing with retirement benefits for public employees terminated allowance for individuals in plaintiffs' position upon the spouses' death or remarriage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the declaratory judgment for plaintiff surviving spouses, finding that plaintiffs' challenge to the provisions of the Judges' Retirement Law that terminated plaintiffs' allowances upon their remarriage was meritless where the subject legislative enactments were not an invalid restraint on marriage or a violation of plaintiffs' equal protection or due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The lower court sustained respondents' demurrer without leave to amend because of appellant's failure to state a cause of action. Appellant sought review. The court found that appellant's return to his place of employment for 45 minutes without returning to work merely to avoid application of Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 19503 was insufficient to prevent the automatic statutory application. Further, respondents had not misinterpreted the statute.

The court held that fewer than 90 percent of the number of valid names required were presented to the clerk and the policies favoring the right of recall did not mean that valid procedural requirements could be ignored. The court directed respondent to issue a certificate of insufficiency under &sect; 27215(d).</SPAN></P>

Veh. Code &sect; 23102(a), because the docket, which used a rubber stamp, inadequately reflected respondent's waiver of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondent was charged with driving under the influence, and it was alleged that he had a prior conviction for the same offense. Respondent ultimately entered a guilty plea and admitted the prior conviction. The following year, respondent filed a motion to strike the second conviction, and the motion was denied. Upon respondent's petition for a writ of mandate, the superior court held that the earlier conviction was unconstitutional because the docket sheet did not reflect that respondent had expressly and explicitly waived his constitutional rights where there was a series of rubber-stamped memorializations. The state, here the real party in interest, appealed. The court reversed, holding that the docket was constitutionally adequate as it showed that respondent had waived his right to counsel, had been informed of his legal rights, and had entered a plea of not guilty. The state's challenge to the constitutionality of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23102.2 was moot as purely hypothetical. Finally, the court held that &sect; 23102.2(b) was presumptively valid in the absence of a clear demonstration that the state's burden of proof required was excessively high.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the superior court's judgment striking respondent's prior conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol because respondent's express waiver of his constitutional rights was sufficiently memorialized despite the fact that a rubber stamp was used.</SPAN></P>

Intervenor city, plaintiff husband's employer, sought reimbursement for expenses already paid on behalf of plaintiff husband and future expenses. The trial court granted defendants' motions for summary judgment as to the complaint in intervention because Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3333.1(b) foreclosed recovery by collateral sources from the tortfeasors. On intervenor's appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 3333.1(b) ended the subrogation rights conferred by statutory and common law in all actions brought by a party injured by the negligence of a health provider. The court found that the statute did not violate equal protection guarantees because there was a rational relationship between the classification, medical malpractice parties, and the legislative purpose, to contain health care costs. The court further held that there was no due process violation because the statute's effect, barring recovery by collateral sources from the tortfeasor, was not demonstrably arbitrary or offensive to due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant former officer of the California Highway Patrol filed an application for disability pension with respondent public employees' retirement system (PERS) which PERS denied.

He primarily contended that the trial court erred when it admitted previously recorded testimony of an unavailable witness, failed to sua sponte instruct the jury on the limited use of evidence, and concluded that felony murder could establish both first-degree murder and the special circumstance needed for the death penalty. The court affirmed. It found that the previously recorded testimony of the unavailable witness was admissible, because prior testimony was admissible under Cal. Evid.

The trial court had no duty to sua sponte instruct the jury on the limited use of evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff dealers' associations brought an action against defendants, state department of motor vehicles (DMV) and others, for declaratory and injunctive relief that seven regulations promulgated by defendant DMV were beyond defendant's power to adopt and, in some instances, were repugnant to the state and federal constitutions. The trial court sustained the challenge. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that five of the regulations contested were defective. The regulations affected penal statutes and several of the regulations exceeded the scope of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 11713 by creating potential liabilities not contemplated by the statute's terms. Several regulations were unconstitutionally vague or lacked any justification for the means of regulation sought to be employed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff patient challenged the order of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which reduced the jury's award of damages in his suit alleging medical malpractice by defendant health care provider when its employees initially diagnosed plaintiff's heart attack as muscle spasm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff patient suffered chest pains and was treated by employees of defendant health care provider for muscle spasms. A later examination showed that plaintiff had suffered a heart attack. Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging malpractice. The jury found in favor of plaintiff and entered special findings on the amount of damages. Pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 3333.1, 3333.2, the trial court reduced the award of damages for noneconomic losses from by half and reduced the award for lost wages to the time of trial by collateral source disability payments. The trial court further ordered that defendant pay future medical expenses not covered by medical insurance provided by plaintiff's employer. Plaintiff appealed. The court held that the statute requiring remittitur was constitutional, and that the damages were proper, but reversed the judgment, holding that defendant was denied the right to a jury panel which was constitutionally selected because the trial court dismissed all potential jurors who received medical care from defendant. The court held that the error of faulty jury instructions was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court's order that reduced the amount of damages awarded to plaintiff patient was reversed because, although statute requiring reduction of damages was constitutional, the trial court committed reversible error when it impermissibly excused from jury duty, over objection, all prospective jurors who were members of the health plan serviced by the hospital that provided plaintiff patient the allegedly negligent care.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff union and employees sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Butte County (California), which denied plaintiffs' petition for a writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive relief that plaintiffs sought to compel defendant city to meet and confer with plaintiff union and an injunction requiring defendant to reinstate plaintiff employees that were discharged for going on strike.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant city had enacted regulations which made participation in a work strike unlawful and subjected the employee to disciplinary action, including discharge. Defendant formally recognized plaintiff union as the representative of plaintiff employees. Plaintiff employees then went on strike and were terminated by defendant. Plaintiffs then filed an action in the trial court after defendant refused to allow plaintiff employees to go back to work. The trial court found that the regulations were validly enacted and that defendant had good cause to terminated plaintiff employees and had properly exercised its discretion. Plaintiffs appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that plaintiff employees did not have a vested interest in their employment after they engaged in the illegal strike. The court held that plaintiff employees had no constitutional right to strike and thus had no right to reinstatement upon discharge for so striking. The court also held that defendant had the power to revoke plaintiff union's recognition. Plaintiff union had actively participated in the strike, and therefore defendant was justified in revoking plaintiff union's recognition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that denied plaintiff union and employees' application for a writ of mandate and injunction against defendant city and held that plaintiff employees had no vested interest in or legitimate claim of entitlement to continued employment after engaging in an illegal strike and defendant was justified in revoking plaintiff union's recognition because of its participation in the strike.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), convicting him of first-degree murder on ground that the jury did not represent a fair cross section of the community and that he received double punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder with special circumstances. On appeal, defendant contended that he did not receive a valid jury trial because the jury that convicted him did not represent a fair cross section of the community. Defendant also contended that the use of a felony to establish first-degree murder and to establish special circumstances requiring life imprisonment without possibility of parole constituted double punishment. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that defendant failed to carry his burden of proof that random selection of jurors from voter registration lists underrepresented a cognizable group. Even if there was an underrepresentation, defendant failed to prove that the exclusion was systematic and exhibited a purposeful discrimination against the group. The court rejected defendant's argument that life imprisonment without possibility of parole for specified felony murder must be restricted to intentional killings. Further, the court concluded that defendant was convicted of only one offense and punished for only one offense and, therefore, was not doubly punished.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant Department of Transportation sought reversal of the judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California) in an action brought by respondent individual concerning the constitutionality of statutory provisions providing for the allocation of appellant's revenue to local taxing agencies and the reimbursement of revenue scheme to lessees of appellant's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondent individual sought declaratory and injunctive relief against appellant Department of Transportation. Respondent alleged that Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect; 104.10 was unconstitutional because it provided for the allocation of appellant's revenue to local taxing agencies, which constituted an unlawful delegation of an exclusive legislative function. Respondent also alleged that an unconstitutional gift of public funds was provided through a system of refunds provided in Cal. Sts. &amp; High Code &sect;104.13. The trial court granted judgment to respondent. The court reversed as Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect; 104.10 did not contain an unconstitutional delegation of authority. The constitutional restriction on how appellant's revenue was allocated was limited to revenue earned on motor vehicle fuels and vehicles or their use. The statute served a constitutional purpose because it applied to revenues derived from leasing lands, which were for future highway needs. Further, because respondent failed to rebut presumption of facial validity of the statutory scheme, the court refused to find reimbursement to property owners, who no longer leased real estate to the appellant, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court in favor of respondent individual because the statute authorizing allocation of appellant revenue from property leased for future highway use to local taxing agencies was not an unconstitutional delegation of authority.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was found guilty of mayhem, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 203. Defendant challenged his conviction and claimed that his conduct did not constitute mayhem within the meaning of &sect; 203. Defendant contended that the statutory definition of mayhem was so unconstitutionally vague that it failed to provide sufficient notice of the prohibited conduct, and that the head should not be considered a member of the body. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that there was no tenable reason for distinguishing prominent facial wounds to a nose, ear, or lip from comparable wounds which happen to miss one of those areas of the head specifically mentioned in &sect; 203. Therefore, the head was a member of the body within the meaning of &sect; 203. The court further concluded that the meaning of disfigure in the context of &sect; 203 was sufficiently definite and certain to inform a person of ordinary intelligence what acts were prohibited. As to defendant, &sect; 203 was sufficiently certain to put him on notice that slashing the victim's face with a sharp instrument so as to leave a permanent three inch scar could reasonably be found to be disfigurement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, which convicted defendant of mayhem and held that defendant's conviction was proper because defendant's conduct left the victim with a permanent disfigurement on her face, which constituted mayhem.</SPAN></P>

The lower court sustained defendants' demurrers to all eight counts of the complaint, and entered a judgment of dismissal. Plaintiff appealed, and the court affirmed. The court determined that plaintiff failed to state any valid claims in inverse condemnation. The court found that any damages alleged to have occurred subsequent to the date the condemnation action was filed with the Public Utility Commission were not compensable as an independent inverse condemnation action because the exclusive jurisdiction of the commission precluded the award of damages in the trial court. The court held that plaintiff's available remedy against defendant state was by mandamus or declaratory relief, not by inverse condemnation. As plaintiff's claims of inverse condemnation were not actionable, and other remedies were available, the court held that the dismissal of the action was proper.</SPAN></P>

Respondent trial court denied petitioners' motion, and petitioners' filed a writ of prohibition. On review, the court granted petitioners' writ, prohibited further proceedings by respondent, and ordered that all items seized upon the execution of the search warrant be suppressed. The court held that there was probable cause to issue the search warrant and that petitioners' argument that aerial surveillance violated their reasonable expectations of privacy was without merit. Nevertheless, the court held that under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1533 service of a warrant outside the statutorily allowed time could only be obtained upon a showing of good cause. The court held that the affidavit contained only general statements about drug dealers and firearms and was not sufficient to support nighttime service.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that applying respondeat superior standards of business activity and foreseeability, there was sufficient connection between the employment and the employee's negligent act to justify holding defendant liable for injuries caused by the employee's conduct. The court ruled that plaintiffs pleaded sufficient facts to support a finding that the employee driver's intoxication occurred at the company party, and his attendance at the party, as well as his state of intoxication, occurred within the scope of his employment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant pled guilty to lewd conduct in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647(a). He was placed on probation, and after all terms of probation were completed, defendant filed a writ of habeas corpus because the conviction on his record precluded him from receiving certain employment opportunities. The trial court granted the writ, and the state appealed. On appeal, the court held that a writ of habeas corpus was not appropriate because defendant was not in custody, and he cited no authority recognizing extension of the writ beyond instances of constructive custody connected with pending criminal proceedings or the possible reimposition of actual custody. The court also held that the trial court erred in relying on a case which shortened the reach of the statute punishing lewd conduct by applying it only if the actor knew or should have known of the presence of persons who may be offended by his conduct. However, the retroactive effect of this case was specifically limited, and defendant's situation did not comply with those limitations. Thus, the court reversed the grant of the writ.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant car manufacturer challenged denial of its motion for a directed verdict and an amended trial court judgment. Appellees were the estate of the deceased driver of a Pinto car that burst into flames in an accident, and a 13-year-old passenger who was severely burned. Appellees had sued on theories of negligence and strict liability, alleging that appellant knew from crash-test results about design defects in the Pinto's fuel system. Appellant assailed the judgment as a whole, assigning numerous errors and irregularities. Appellant primarily contended that the punitive damages award was statutorily unauthorized and constitutionally invalid. Appellee estate cross-appealed, claiming that the statutory bar against punitive damages in a wrongful death action was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment because it was not a denial of equal protection to preclude punitive damages in a wrongful death action. Finding appellant's contentions either lacked merit or failed to demonstrate prejudice, the court held that the punitive damages award was reasonable and just, and declined to modify the judgment by reducing the amount of the remittitur.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment awarding punitive damages was affirmed as reduced because the reduced punitive damage award was reasonable and just, and was not excessive in light of its deterrent purpose, appellant's wealth, and the size of the compensatory awards. The court also held that a rational justification existed for the legislative denial of the right to seek punitive damages for wrongful death actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A jury convicted defendant of burglary and of having committed four alleged prior felony convictions. He appealed, asserting that the trial court erred in denying his motion for separate trials on the issue of guilt and the issue of alleged priors and in denying his motion to suppress an in-court identification. The court ruled that a bifurcated trial was consistent with the right to a fair trial of the validity of the prior convictions. It would have prevented the jury being advised of the alleged prior convictions unless it first found defendant guilty of the charged offense. It concluded that the unitary procedure resulted in prejudice that was an abuse of discretion and deprived defendant of due process of law by revealing his prior criminality without advancing any legitimate state interest. It held that the trial court had properly denied the motion to suppress the in-court identification because the photographic procedure was fair.</SPAN></P>

In the retrial, the trial court instructed the jury to consider the comparative negligence of plaintiff's driver and defendant. The jury rendered a verdict for defendant, and plaintiff sought review of the judgment. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the procedure which the trial court chose for preserving the issue posed by plaintiff's settlement with his driver was not likely to have confused or misled the jury to such an extent as to require reversal, and that no judicial authority precluded the jury's consideration of the conduct of the settling tortfeasor in determining whether defendant was guilty of negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court dismissed charges against respondents on the basis that the only evidence supporting the charges had been suppressed. The state appealed. The court evaluated whether the fruits of a probationary search must be suppressed because subsequent to the search, the conviction underlying the terms of probation was reversed. Respondent pleaded to possession of marijuana and was granted probation upon the condition that he submit his person and property to search and seizure by a probation officer or police officer without a warrant. An anonymous telephone caller reported that respondent had marijuana in his home and respondent was later charged. The conviction for possession of marijuana was reversed on the ground that the evidence in that case had been illegally obtained. Thereafter the trial court granted respondents' motion to dismiss. An individual is subject to all the disabilities of a judgment, commitment or sentence, which, though voidable, had not been judicially voided. The dismissal judgment was reversed and remanded because respondent's consent to the warrantless search was not vitiated by the subsequent reversal of his conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the petitions for habeas corpus and held that while the trial court erred in not allowing defense counsel to use the words &quot;free speech&quot; and &quot;free assembly&quot; during summations, that error was not prejudicial because defense counsel was able to argue the elements of free speech and free assembly, and because that error did not contribute to the convictions.

Appellant had initially filed suit to challenge the sufficiency of an environmental impact report (EIR) that was approved by the respondent county board of supervisors, and to compel the county to set aside its approval of the EIR.

The court noted that a prejudicial abuse of discretion standard was used to review the adequacy of the county's actions in preparing the EIR. The court found that an EIR had to contain facts and analysis, not just the bare conclusions of a public agency. The court found appellant's contentions that respondent's EIR's were inadequate and that appellant had communicated with respondent about deficiencies in EIR's over a period of time. The court reversed the denial of the writ of mandate to the appellant.

Defendants generally demurred to the complaint on the grounds that &sect; 772.030 violated the impairment of contracts clauses of both U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The trial court sustained the demurrer. On appeal, the court held &sect; 772.030 did not unconstitutionally impair the obligation of contracts. The court reasoned that the interest of the state to be served by enactment of the legislation was substantial and significant. Defendants also contended that &sect; 772.030 violated the substantive due process guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 15. The court disagreed and held that property rights were subject to reasonable regulation by legislation validly enacted under the police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the decision of the trial court sustaining defendants' demurrer. The court held that the statute plaintiffs brought their action under did not violate the impairment of contracts clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The court reasoned that the impairment caused by the statute was sufficiently necessary to the public welfare as to justify the impairment.</SPAN></P>

Because of the difference in future treatment of landlords, such as plaintiff, who had raised rent lawfully in the past and those who had not, plaintiff sought to classify the legislative ordinance as a violation of the U.

The lower court held that limitation on future residential rent increases was a legitimate legislative goal and was not a penalty for the past lawful raising of residential rent.

The court also held that defendants failed to make the required showing that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the injunction. The court held that the injury alleged by the people was irreparable in nature because, if the films in question were later found to be obscene, the exhibition would have been a wrong of a repeated and continuing character, and the trial court's finding that the films were obscene by clear and convincing evidence showed that it was probable that the people would have obtained the permanent injunction it sought.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondent union representatives picketed appellant agricultural employer. Respondent, the Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ALRB), requested relief pursuant to Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1160.4, and the superior court issued an order granting respondent union representatives limited access to appellant's property for a specified time before work and during lunch to meet with nonstriking employees. On appeal, the court reversed, and held that &quot;just and proper&quot; temporary relief as permitted by Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1160.4 did not include the grant of even limited strike access to a grower's property absent a valid rule or regulation by respondent ALRB which permitted such access. The court cited Cal. Code of Regs. tit. 8, &sect; 20900(d), which stated that the legislative purpose of bringing certainty and fair play to an unstable and potentially volatile condition in the California fields could best be served by adoption of rules on access, and that case-by-case adjudication or an overly general rule would cause further uncertainty. Although this rule applied only to the preelection period, the court held that the need to regulate access by rule was even greater during a strike.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that appellant was properly treated as deriving income from sources both within and outside California as appellant and its foreign subsidiaries were a unitary enterprise. The court applied a three-part test to determine the unitary nature of appellant's business, unity of ownership, unity of operation, and unity of use, and found that all three were satisfied. Petitioner and its subsidiaries engaged in the same business activities, and their administrative construction provided a strong inference of a unitary business. The tax did not violate petitioner's due process rights as petitioner availed itself of the substantial privilege of carrying on business in, and the tax was applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with, California.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant and two other men kicked and beat their robbery victim so severely that he later died. Appellant was convicted of murder of the first degree. The special circumstance allegation, that the murder was committed while appellant was engaged in the commission of robbery within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17)(i), was found to be true. The district attorney elected not to seek the death penalty. Appellant was committed to state prison for life without the possibility for parole. The court found that intent to kill was not required for the sentencing enhancement to apply, only that the killing occurred during the commission of a robbery. The court held that appellant was not being punished twice for the same offense, only that he was being punished more severely for killing his victim in addition to robbing him. The court also held that the punishment of imprisonment without parole was not disproportionate to the offense committed based on the purpose of the statute, internal state comparisons, and comparisons with the rest of the nation. Therefore, the court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

VI, cl. 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondent was convicted of mailing threatening letters in violation of 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 338a. Respondent was granted a full and unconditional pardon by the President of the United States. Respondent secured employment as a security guard, a position requiring him to carry a gun. Appellants, the state attorney general and others, refused respondent permission to carry a gun pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12021, which criminalized gun possession by one convicted of a felony. Respondent brought an action for declaratory relief, and the trial court held in favor of respondent. Appellants sought review of the judgment. The court ruled that under the Federal Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2, a state could not validly deny to a person holding a federal pardon the full effect of that pardon. Further, the court held that a state could not punish for an offense for which a person was given a federal pardon. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of respondent, concluding that the federal pardon released respondent from all disabilities resulting from his federal conviction and that the state could not, under the Supremacy Clause, disregard that release.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Judgment in favor of respondent was affirmed where the federal pardon granted to respondent prevented the state from disregarding the federal pardon to disable him from the right to carry a gun.</SPAN></P>

Complaint for declaratory relief was filed to determine liability among insurance companies. Insurance company that was no longer a party on appeal was adjudicated to be insolvent. Appellants claimed that respondent, California Insurance Guarantee Association, was required to pay their claims against insolvent insurance company. Court disagreed since appellants' claims against respondent were specifically excluded by statute. Moreover, court found statute was constitutional since legislature's intention to protect the public, not provide a fund for protection of insurance companies, was rational.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff contractors sought review of an order from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which found in favor of defendant state stabilization board, in determining that sales and use tax was owed by plaintiffs on their construction contract for a state agency, together with interest. Plaintiffs contended that transmission lines were not within the taxable classification of real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">At issue was whether materials purchased by plaintiff contractors, for construction of an electrical transmission line for a U.S. agency, were taxable under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect;&sect; 6001, 6051, 6201. Plaintiffs argued the unreasonableness of the classification of transmission lines as real property and that defendant state equalization board was estopped to collect the tax because of its prior ruling that no tax was due. Plaintiffs' purchases of cable, insulators, and fabricated steel towers, for which they gave resale certificates, were purchases of materials consumed by plaintiffs in the performance of a contract to improve real property. As the users of those materials, plaintiffs were required to pay use tax. The state was not estopped from collecting a tax which was owing, even though a state's representative may have previously adopted an incorrect interpretation of the law and advised the public that no taxes would become due on a particular transaction. State officers and agencies had no power to estop the state from collecting a validly owed tax. However, while a taxpayer's liability for the original tax remained, its liability for penalties and interest was excusable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">To the extent the judgment reflected plaintiff contractors' liability for the original amount of sales and use tax due to defendant state equalization board, it was correct, as they had performed on a contract to improve real property, which was taxable. However, to the extent the judgment denied plaintiffs' claim for return of interest, it was erroneous, as such penalty was excusable. Therefore, the court reversed for entry of a calculated sum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant, director of the state department of health services, sought review of a writ of mandate, granted by the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California) to respondents, health care providers and a medical association, requiring appellant to amend regulations raising Medi-Cal reimbursement rates, to make the new rates retroactively applicable to the providers' reimbursement for their services under the old rate schedule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After the state legislature adopted Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;&sect; 14075 - 14080, establishing a new schedule for reimbursing physicians and dentists for services rendered to Medi-Cal patients, respondents, health care providers and professional associations, filed suit to compel appellant, the director of the state department of health services, to give effect to the retroactive increase called for in the new rate schedule. The superior court granted a peremptory writ of mandate requiring appellant to amend his promulgated regulation to make the new rates retroactively applicable to services rendered by respondents, and appellant sought review. The court reversed the judgment. It held that the relationship between the state and respondents was contractual, because the state's offer through the applicable regulations, and respondents' acceptance, constituted an implied contract. The court held that retroactive application of higher reimbursement rates would thus contravene Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 17, that prohibited payment of extra compensation to state contractors for services already rendered, as well as U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, prohibiting legislative impairment of contracts.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 10 because it constituted legislative impairment of contract.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the ordinance was constitutionally valid on its face and was a permissible use of defendant's police power. The trial court also found that plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies in that they had not applied for the permits. On appeal, the court reversed and held that Ordinance No. 1116, was unconstitutional on its face because it lacked objective guidelines for the issuance of permits required for regulation of activities protected by U. S. Const. amend. I. The court held that plaintiffs' fear of arrest was sufficient to show irreparable injury; thus, plaintiffs could seek to enjoin enforcement of the statute without first seeking a permit.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 1538.5 allowed a lower court to have announced one ground on which to suppress evidence, continued the hearing, and later considered an alternate ground contemporaneously advanced in further support of or in opposition to such suppression. When there had not been a full hearing on the matter and there had only been a tentative ruling, the later hearing was not an impermissible relitigation of the original motion. The court also held that Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 2805 was constitutional because it allowed for warrantless searches made under reasonable circumstances, within constitutional limitations.</SPAN></P>

The statutory &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; standard of section 1369, subdivision (f) is approved.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which entered a jury finding that defendant was not competent to stand trial by a preponderance of the evidence after a pre-trial hearing to determine defendant's mental competency pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 1368, 1369.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant's criminal proceedings were suspended, and a jury trial was held to determine defendant's mental competency pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 1368, 1369. Based on the state's evidence, the jury found defendant not competent to stand trial by a preponderance of the evidence. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that a &sect; 1369 hearing was not criminal in nature because defendant was not charged with a criminal act, was not subject to criminal proceedings if found insane, the jury would not necessarily have to determine his guilt, and commitment would not necessarily stigmatize him as having committed a crime. The court held that due process did not mandate use of the beyond a reasonable doubt burden of proof because defendant could not be subjected to long-term conservatorship proceedings as a result of the initial &sect; 1368 finding of incompetence. The court also noted that the &sect; 1368 proceeding was designed only to protect the accused. The court emphasized the mandatory reviews under the statutory scheme that ensured that a defendant would not be committed longer than the lesser of three years or the maximum lawful term of incarceration for the original offense charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The prosecution challenged a judgment that granted defendant's motion to dismiss the information that charged him with two counts of making terrorist threats in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422(a), based on lack of evidence. Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to prove his specific intent to achieve social or political goals by his threat, and probable cause to sustain the information did not exist. The court reversed the judgment and held that probable cause existed because defendant's threats to kill police officers' children that made reference to the &quot;Islamic Code,&quot; and his statement that within three days of taking the life of each child he and his wife would be out of the country, could reasonably be understood to be those of a person who subscribed to a foreign political philosophy. The court held that the threats proscribed by &sect; 422(a) were not constitutionally protected speech. The court held that &sect; 422 was sufficiently precise to inform one contemplating the communication of such a threat that he did so at the risk of violating the law, and was neither overbroad nor vague.</SPAN></P>

Code tit. 22, &sect; 72629(a) for not having operable nurse call buttons and with a class &quot;B&quot; violation of Cal. Admin. Code tit. &sect; 72325(a) as patients were not provided with equipment to prevent bed sores. Appellant resisted the class &quot;A&quot; penalty and respondent filed a lawsuit for enforcement. The lower court determined that the inoperable call buttons presented an imminent danger to the patients and affirmed the class &quot;A&quot; citation. The court affirmed the lower court's decision because it was reasonable to infer that a risk of harm was inherent in a situation where a patient cannot call for help. The court held that there was no requirement that death or serious harm actually result before a citation was issued. The court concluded that the statutory requirement of proper patient care included equipment to prevent bed sores.</SPAN></P>

The victim in each case was the same prisoner. Three co-defendants were charged with the offenses. Defendant appealed his convictions and alleged that the jury charge on distrust of accomplice testimony was erroneous, that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288a was unconstitutional, and that there were improper multiple convictions. The court affirmed the conviction and stated that because the trial court instructed the jury on how to determine whether a co-defendant was an accomplice, and because defendant did not call him as his witness, the instructions were proper. Defendant had no standing to attack the constitutionality of &sect; 288 as it applied to consenting adults because his alleged violation pertained to force. Also, the proscription against multiple convictions for greater and lesser offenses did not apply because the charges against defendant referred to separate acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was a guest at a party, which had generated several noise complaints from neighbors due to the loud band. Several police units arrived on the scene, including a police helicopter. The police ordered the guests to disperse. As an officer stepped into the kitchen through an outside door, defendant threatened him with an unplugged electric knife. Defendant was charged with remaining present at the place of an unlawful assembly and several other charges, including possession of a switchblade knife, and was convicted of all charges. The court held that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that a violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 25658, furnishing alcohol to persons under 21, supported the unlawful act element of the crime of unlawful assembly. The court also held that the trial court's instruction as to intent was ambiguous and unclear. The court found that the evidence did not support the contention that the party posed a threat of violence. The court further found that the discovery of defendant's switchblade was the direct result of the police officers' unlawful entry into the party.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Real party in interest, heir of decedent, filed a complaint for wrongful death against petitioner manufacturer, and alleged that decedent died of carbon monoxide asphyxiation in a motor home manufactured by petitioner.

Petitioner filed a demurrer and argued that punitive damages were not available in wrongful death actions under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 377. The trial court held that Cal. Civ. Proc.

The court also held that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 377 was constitutional under the rational basis standard. The court refused to apply a stricter standard on real party's contention that her right to punitive damages was fundamental. By enacting Cal. Civ. Proc.

Respondent state was alleged to have failed to revoke the driver's license even though it was aware he was an epileptic. The respondent state was properly dismissed as it had not been aware of the driver's epilepsy until after the accident occurred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff creditor challenged a trial court order discharging an attachment issued against defendant insolvent insurance company's property, which secured a promissory note. Plaintiff elected to accelerate payment of the note after defendant's conservator tendered an interest payment late along with a letter that stated that the payment was not an acknowledgement of defendant's obligations under the note and that it was negotiating an agreement for the reinsurance of defendant's life insurance policies in exchange for currently held assets. The court affirmed the trial court order discharging the attachment, but remanded the case to the trial court and directed that plaintiff be permitted to pursue further proceedings on the main relief sought - judgment on the promissory note. The court held that defendant's attempt to unilaterally deny plaintiff recourse to its real property situated in California was contrary to California law and public policy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant criminal sought review of his conviction for murder, attempted murder, robbery and burglary after entering a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. Defendant was found sane at the time of the commission of the offenses, but was deemed a sociopath. The lower court instructed the jury in the language of the second paragraph of the American Law Institute's (ALI) test of criminal insanity. Defendant claimed it was error to so instruct the jury. On review, the court found that the adoption of the second paragraph of the ALI test, which provided that the terms mental disease or defect did not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise anti-social conduct, was a public policy decision. To exclude deliberate and persistent offenders from responsibility from criminal action without a diagnosable mental disease or defect would have been absurd, and a sociopath was properly excluded from the definition of mental disease or defect. The conviction was affirmed, because it was proper to instruct the jury of the above in an appropriate case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant nonminority persons challenged an order that imposed minority-person quotas on hiring and promotions by appellee officials of a city fire department based on the trial court's findings of long-existing discriminatory patterns in the employment of firefighters. The trial court entered the order even though appellees had long since ended the historical discrimination in hiring and promotion practices, and the city was making a good faith endeavor to ameliorate and overcome the bitter effects of that discrimination. Appellants contended that the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000e-2(a)(1), did not permit the state or its courts to racially discriminate against nonminority persons, who themselves were individually without fault, in order to ameliorate the effects of past racial discrimination against minority persons generally. The appellate court agreed and reversed the order, holding that Title VII prohibited racial discrimination against nonminorities upon the same standards as would be applicable if they were minorities. The court also held that a quota was not less offensive when it served to exclude a racial majority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was reversed because there was no evidence of present-day discrimination against minority persons, and no valid justification was demonstrated for imposing a judicially fashioned affirmative relief to ameliorate or dissipate the effects of past discriminatory practices. The court held that the preferential treatment of minorities in employment was invalid if it deprived nonminorities of a benefit because of race.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a petition to compel the state to set aside the information on the grounds that his arrest was illegal. On appeal, the court denied defendant's petition. Defendant admitted the undercover officers into his home. The fact that the officers gained admittance based on defendant's mistaken belief that they were going to purchase cocaine was irrelevant.

In denying reconsideration of the supplemental decision, respondent board adopted the reasoning of the workers' compensation judge that petitioners had potentially meritorious arguments that &sect; 4706.5 was unconstitutional.

Respondent obtained a preliminary injunction enjoining both civil and criminal enforcement of the ordinance on the grounds that the state had preempted the field and that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, among others. The court reversed the judgment enjoining the ordinance, holding that the state had not preempted the field of regulation of businesses displaying drug paraphernalia to minors. The court further held that government regulation designed to protect children from exploitation by traffickers in drugs and drug-related products was a goal of the highest priority and that the ordinance was reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that compelling government interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner county sought a writ of mandate in the Court of Appeal, Third Appellate District (California), to require respondent county treasurer to serve and collect special assessments from property owners for sewer improvements. The issues were whether special assessments and the acceptance of federal grants by petitioner were sufficiently similar to &quot;proceeds of taxes&quot; to be prohibited under Cal. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner county sought a writ of mandate to require respondent county treasurer to serve and collect special assessments for sewer improvements. The court held that proceeds from special assessments were not within the not restricted to language of proceeds of taxes in Cal. Const. art. XIII B, &sect; 8(c). There was a distinction between a tax levied by the legislature for the general public good and a special assessment levied within a limited area to force the payment of a benefit which would enhance the value of the property taxed. Strictly speaking, special assessments were not taxes at all. With the exception of state subventions, the prohibition within art. XIII B, &sect; 8(c) was on general assessments. This conclusion was supported by the ballot arguments in favor of the initiative. The doctrine of ejusdem generis could not be used to include them. Art. XIII B was not designed to close any loopholes in Cal. Const. art. XIII A. Under ejusdem generis, federal grants were not sufficiently similar to state subventions to be included within the &quot;proceeds of taxes.&quot; Construing federal grants as &quot;proceeds of taxes&quot; would not further the purposes of art. XIII B. The court issued the writ.</SPAN></P>

As used in the article, &quot;proceeds of taxes&quot; contemplated only those impositions which raised general tax revenues for the entity raising them.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the special-circumstance allegations did not have to be stricken because the prosecution failed to charge petitioner with first degree murder. The court also held that the special circumstance contained in &sect; 190.2 (a)(14) was not vague under either U.S. Const. amend XIV or the due process clause of the California constitution.

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c9">45&nbsp;For the sake of completeness, we are not unaware of two actions defendant Pratt has pending in federal courts, one of which is in Washington, D.C. under the FOI Act seeking further disclosure of FBI files pertaining to Cointelpro and the defendant herein.  The other action is in a prison civil rights suit in the United States District Court in San Francisco in which FBI files have been subpoenaed from August 1968 to August 1972 pertaining to Pratt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">Our conclusions and holdings herein are based on the information and documentation supplied this court by defense counsel, the California Attorney General's office and the FBI as of the date of filing this opinion.  Should additional evidence be uncovered in the future from the above sources which adequately and legally support defendant's contentions, our determinations herein do not, of course, preclude the filing of a new petition seeking appropriate relief.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">In re Swain, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">, 34 Cal.2d 300.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c16">Re Dissenting Opinion</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">: The dissenting opinion concludes that defendant Pratt should be granted an &quot;evidentiary hearing&quot; because he was not afforded &quot;due process of law&quot; in that his trial in 1972 was not fundamentally fair.  Such a conclusion clearly is not supported by the record and is predicated on a selective reading of the record and misconstruction and misapplication of controlling law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">&quot;Due process,&quot; simply stated, requires notice and an opportunity to be heard by an impartial tribunal under applicable rules of general law.  The in-depth and exhaustive analysis of the total record in conjunction with the application of settled rules of law which govern original habeas corpus proceedings as discussed in this majority opinion amply demonstrates that defendant Pratt's conviction was in full accordance with &quot;due process&quot; requirements and that he has simply failed to make a sufficient showing to justify any relief whatsoever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dissenting opinion has bought hook-line-and-sinker defendant's arguments in his petition which when dissected and analyzed have as little substance as a handful of fog.  Reliance on some nebulous concept that a fair trial was denied defendant based solely on allegations which are wholly speculative and conjectural and admittedly unproven not only defies logic but ignores the standards set by the Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">In re Imbler, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">, 60 Cal.2d 554. Again, mere allegations of &quot;governmental improprieties&quot; based on pure surmise and speculation sans supporting facts are insufficient to support the granting of relief.  (See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">In re Lawler, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">, 23 Cal.3d 190.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's petition for habeas corpus in an original proceeding before this court is primarily directed at &quot;governmental improprieties&quot; on the federal level by the FBI.  Inquiry at an evidentiary hearing into the nine items listed at the end of the dissenting opinion would be nothing more than a &quot;fishing expedition&quot; into state waters burning up additional court time and resulting in an unnecessary expenditure of public funds.  Defendant already has two &quot;lines&quot; into federal waters by way of an FOI Act case and a civil rights action in federal courts in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco.  As previously noted if those &quot;fishing expeditions&quot; uncover evidence of a sufficient quantity and quality to adequately and legally support his contentions, he is not precluded from filing a new petition seeking appropriate relief.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">In re Swain, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">, 34 Cal.2d 300.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c16">The dissent's items 1, 2 and 3</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> listed for inquiry at an evidentiary hearing pertain to FBI informants in the defense camp during the trial.  The dissent's argument in relation to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Barber </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16"> Municipal Court, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">, 24 Cal.3d 742, is unintelligible.  We need not repeat here the total of six major distinguishing factors and reasons listed in the body of this majority opinion demonstrating that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Barber</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> is clearly inapplicable to the instant case.  In response to the dissent's reliance on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Barber</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">, we add that such a hearing would be useless since it would be held to answer questions with a presently known answer and a known result.  There is no dispute that FBI informants (as distinguished from local law enforcement informants) were in the defense camp and no doubt that the FBI would refuse to disclose their identities in order to protect the FBI informants' lives.  Moreover, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Barber's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> sole remedy is a per se dismissal of the underlying charges.  This in no way authorizes a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">carte blanche</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> evidentiary hearing on matters unrelated to the issue of informants in the defense camp being privy to discussions between defendant and counsel concerning defense trial strategy or tactics.  Nor does the dissent explain how California can constitutionally apply to a federal agency its ruling in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Barber</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> which admittedly is at odds with the United States Supreme Court's decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Weatherford </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16"> Bursey, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">, 429 U.S. 545. Again, critical here is the fact that while the FBI informants may have had access to defense strategies the information obtained was of such a general nature as to be of no aid to the prosecution and was not detrimental to the defense; in any event it was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">not</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> transmitted to the local prosecuting attorney for use during the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">It would appear, therefore, as indicated in footnote 43, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">ante</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">, that the only purpose in seeking to have a California court order the FBI to disclose the names of its informants is a tactical maneuver by Pratt's counsel to attempt to obliterate the distinction between federal and state informants and to persuade some trial court to blaze a new trial by dismissing the underlying murder charge against Pratt and thus gain his release from prison irrespective of his jury conviction of the &quot;tennis court murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c16">The dissent's item 4</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> pertains to prosecution witness Julius (Julio) Butler which is discussed in great detail in the body of this majority opinion and needs no further amplification except that, as noted, Butler did not consider himself an informant (snitch) and Sergeant Rice testified that Butler furnished information to the L.A.P.D.  Moreover, assuming, arguendo, that Butler did lie in respect to his informant status, the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16"> Ruthford, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">, 14 Cal.3d 399, relied on in the dissent was an appeal case as distinguished from a case arising out of a petition for habeas corpus, it does not stand for the proposition that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">any</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> false testimony is reversible error.  Furthermore, if on appeal a defendant must establish the substantial materiality of the suppressed evidence, which was not established here, a lesser standard certainly should not be applied to a habeas corpus postconviction proceeding.  Nor does the dissenting opinion explain how Butler's denial of the fact that he was an FBI informant (if he was one) relate to Butler's interest in testifying truthfully or falsely as to Pratt's admissions to him, the truth of which was corroborated by other prosecution witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c16">The dissent's item 5</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> poses the question: &quot;Was the petitioner a subject focused on for 'neutralization' by Cointelpro prior to trial in 1972?&quot; Of course, he was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">There is no question the Pratt became the subject of Cointelpro's efforts to &quot;neutralize&quot; him after his assumption of a leadership position in the LA BPP in April 1969.  However, there is no showing whatsoever, either in the Church Committee Report or before this court, that Cointelpro's counterintelligence measures and techniques for &quot;neutralization,&quot; the use of leaflets and fake letters which were employed &quot;to deny unity of action in the effort of the LA BPP&quot; by splitting the BPP and turning the leaders against each other included a technique of &quot;framing&quot; Pratt of the &quot;tennis court murder.&quot; In fact the Church Committee Report states that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">all Cointelpro activities were officially terminated on April 27, 1971, * over a year before Pratt's trial in 1972</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">.  Nor does the dissent otherwise establish how the fact that Pratt was an object of Cointelpro as described in the body of this majority opinion was at all relevant to the &quot;tennis court murder&quot; of which he was convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">* The Church Committee Report states the &quot;all Cointelpros were officially terminated on April 27, 1971.&quot; The Committee requested that the FBI provide it with a list of any &quot;Cointelpro-type&quot; actions since April 28, 1971.  The Bureau located and furnished the Committee two instances of posttermination Cointelpro-type operations.  One instance involved an FBI contact with the editor of a Southern newspaper to arrange to have reporters interview KKK members and write an article based on those interviews while furnishing information on Klan use of the polygraph to &quot;weed out FBI informants.&quot; The result of the subsequent publication of the Klan activities resulted in a number of Klan officials ceasing their activities.  The other instance involved an anonymous letter and derogatory newspaper clipping sent to a BPP officer in the Northeast to discredit a Panther leader's activities.  The committee discovered a third instance where an attorney's political background was furnished to a friendly newspaper intended to discredit an attorney and his client.  (P. 13.) None pertain to the BPP on the west coast and none pertain to Pratt and none involve &quot;framing&quot; anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c16">As to item 6</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">, it is common knowledge that law enforcement agencies at various levels of government (city, county, state and federal) share or pass along information about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">specific crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> and criminal activity to each other.  Such a procedure not only conforms to long accepted practice and is completely proper in all respects but is highly desirable in the war against rampant criminal activity.  Here, there is no showing by defense counsel that the prosecution failed to supply any information at its disposal to which the defense may have been legally entitled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">In addition, although it is somewhat unclear for what purpose the dissent relies upon </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">People </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16"> Mejia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> (1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 574 [129 Cal.Rptr. 192], such reliance is misplaced as there is no showing that the FBI or the prosecution separately or in concert deported, hid or failed to produce any material witnesses.  The Court of Appeal in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Mejia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> (57 Cal.App.3d at p. 581) stated: &quot;If the federal government, unilaterally and without the knowledge and aid of state authorities, deports aliens who later turn out to be material witnesses in state court criminal proceedings, the distinction urged by the People might well be valid.  That is not the case presented here.  There can be no question but that state action initiated and was at least partially responsible for the fact Velasquez and Arce became unavailable as witnesses . . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c16">The dissent by its item 7</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> refers to a matter not properly before this court in these original proceedings.  It apparently refers to an intelligence report from the L.A.P.D. dated March 28, 1971, which had been sealed at the defense request.  This document was viewed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">in camera</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> by this panel on its own motion on August 27, 1980.  The portion which the dissent evidently refers to pertains to the second suspect in the &quot;tennis court murder&quot; (presumably the person named &quot;Tyrone&quot; who was introduced to Butler by Pratt on the evening preceding the robbery-murder).  This report was supplied Judge Kathleen Parker by Pratt's defense counsel for purposes of the defendant's previous petition for habeas corpus.  Presumably to avoid public exposure of the contents in the report which shows conduct inconsistent with Pratt's claimed innocence, defense counsel Stuart Hanlon obtained an ex parte protective order from Federal Magistrate Frederick J. Woelflen releasing the document for an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">in camera</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> inspection by Judge Parker only.  The order contained the request by Magistrate Woelflen that his court be contacted &quot;before releasing said document to the prosecution or to any other persons.&quot; This court, in view of the dissent's reference to the second person involved in the Santa Monica shooting to which the FBI and the L.A.P.D. had some knowledge, requested permission telephonically of Magistrate Woelflen to disclose the contents of the protected document.  This request was granted by Magistrate Woelflen as it would have no effect on the pending federal case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">The above referred to intelligence report dated March 28, 1971, contains a brief statement that &quot;(source deleted) advised that a brother named (deleted), last name unknown, assisted Elmer Pratt in the robbery and murder on the Santa Monica tennis court.&quot; The source recalled that the second suspect had been arrested in a stolen Cadillac but the cases were dismissed, mentioned the area in which the suspect hung out and a girl friend but ends with the statement: &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">When Pratt was indicted for the shooting, (deletion) received orders to split from Los Angeles</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">.&quot; The balance of the lengthy intelligence report refers to another murder &quot;on order from National Headquarters, Berkeley, California&quot; because the victim had been &quot;screwing around with (deletion) and because he was dropping too many 'Bennies,' screwing up him [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">] mind, and a security risk to the Black Panther Party.&quot; The main portion of this lengthy report, in addition to the mention of the murder of a special officer and bombings by Black Panthers (names deleted), contained information of elaborate plans between defendant Pratt and others outside the jail to effect Pratt's and other Black Panthers' escape from the county jail, included the use of weapons against police officers if necessary and for a switch to &quot;cold&quot; cars (other vehicles) a short distance from the area of escape to &quot;hideout pads&quot;; although there was evidence of a &quot;dry run&quot; prior to the date scheduled for the jail break, the escape plan was never executed.  The report also includes information from informants indicating a plot to kidnap public officials to be &quot;released upon receipt of a one-way ticket via Airline Algeria for (names deleted).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">Since the second suspect (presumably Tyrone) had &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">split from Los Angeles</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">,&quot; there is no showing that the prosecution knew how he could be located.  As the evidence is undisputed that two male Black Panthers were involved in the &quot;tennis court murder,&quot; defendant Pratt would be in a better position than the police to locate the other suspect who &quot;split.&quot; In addition, it is obvious that the information contained in the report is indicative of Pratt's guilt rather than of his innocence in that he made plans to escape from jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c16">The dissent's item 8</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> selects on question addressed to victim Kenneth Olsen and his answer out of the lengthy report's transcript and refers to a declaration by Deputy Public Defender Laurence E. Rivitz indicating that Mr. Olsen had previously identified two other suspects in a lineup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dissent acknowledges that the issue of the Rivitz declaration was raised in 1972 at defendant's motion for a new trial and rejected by the trial court.  The issue was not specifically raised on appeal (see Appen. B) but was apparently before Judge Parker again on defendant's recent petition for habeas corpus before her court which was denied.  Defendant has not included that issue in his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">original proceedings</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> before this court.  The dissent has, therefore, resurrected the issue although it is not properly before this court.  In any event, this information was known to Pratt at the time of his appeal and was not raised.  Habeas corpus is not a vehicle for raising contentions which could have been made on appeal but which were not.  The burden is upon the defendant to give a satisfactory reason for not raising the issue on appeal ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">In re Walker</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> (1974) 10 Cal.3d 764 [112 Cal.Rptr. 177, 518 P.2d 1129]) and even if the allegations could be considered under the rules applicable to habeas corpus the defendant's unreasonable and unexplained delay in raising the issue precludes relief.  (See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">In re Wells</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9"> (1967) 67 Cal.2d 873 [64 Cal.Rptr. 317, 343 P.2d 613].)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c16">As to the dissent's item 9</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">, see footnote 43, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">ante</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">A basic concept built into our Constitution is that if changes are to be made in our form of government and its major duly constituted institutions that such changes are to be brought about only by peaceful legitimate means through the political process at the ballot box and not by bullets and bombs.  The record before us reflects that the FBI perceived the BPP as a violence-prone black (racist) hate organization whose means of revolutionary changes included the use of bullets and bombs and literally at war with law enforcement officers (see Appen. D ).  As the Church Committee Report indicated, the FBI had few if any guidelines to go by and took the initiative by putting into place Cointelpro to meet that internal threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Pratt's petition in the instant case is hollow.  It follows the too often typical pattern in today's upside-down system of criminal justice where a defendant himself charged with or convicted of such &quot;illegal acts,&quot; such as murder, attempted murder and robbery in the instant case, seeks to focus attention on the alleged &quot;illegal acts&quot; of law enforcement officers.  Without commenting on the propriety of the techniques and measures used by Cointelpro, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">relevant here is the fact that there is no showing that FBI's Cointelpro techniques included the &quot;framing&quot; of defendant Pratt for the &quot;tennis court murder</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the case at bench defendant Pratt was only entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect trial.  The record reflects that he was fairly tried and justly convicted by due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">Finally, the dissent by referring to selective portions of the record instead of the total record and ignoring controlling precedent has apparently succumbed to the discredited &quot;ideal of perfectibility&quot; which is &quot;the concept that with the expenditure of sufficient time, patience, energy, and money it is possible eventually to achieve perfect justice in all legal process.&quot; Such a &quot;noble ideal has consistently spawned results that can only be described as pandemoniac&quot; in our criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">&quot;[In] our pursuit of the will-o-the-wisp of perfectibility, we necessarily neglect other elements of an effective procedure, notably the resolution of controversies within a reasonable time, at a reasonable cost, with reasonable uniformity, and under settled rules of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">&quot;. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">&quot;The ideal of perfectibility denies the existence of price and cost, and, at least, in criminal procedure, relies heavily on the argument that no sacrifice is too great when human life or liberty is involved.  Better that a hundred guilty men should go free than that once innocent man be convicted, is the rallying cry of the perfectionists.  But this slogan gets us no further than does its obverse -- better that one life should be sacrificed that a hundred others may be saved.  The plain fact of the matter is that in human affairs we balance the cost of human life against other considerations in almost everything we do, and it is incorrect to say that the sacrifice of human life to attain particular ends is never justified.  The real question is one of relative values -- is the end in view worth the price it is likely to cost?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c9">&quot;But, the perfectionists argue, no sacrifice is too great to assure that in a given case perfect justice will be done.  Ignored is the sacrifice of the legal order itself and of the life, liberty, and property of those that the legal order is designated to protect.  Ignored also is the necessity that the procedure we follow lend substance to the moral and ethical idea that those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.&quot; (Fleming, The Price of Perfect Justice -- The Adverse Consequences of Current Legal Doctrine on the American Courtroom (1974) pp. 6-9.)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant filed an original habeas corpus petition seeking his release from prison following his convictions of first-degree murder, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187, two counts of first-degree robbery, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211, and assault with intent to commit murder, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 217. Defendant alleged that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had a spy on his defense team, which mandated a dismissal of the charges, and that he was entitled to a new trial or evidentiary hearing because two prosecution witnesses lied, and that the FBI concealed evidence that corroborated defendant's alibi. The court denied the petition for habeas corpus. The court found that the facts of the case did not mandate a dismissal because any leak of information from the defense was of a general nature and procured by the FBI, a federal agency not under the court's purview. The court held that the allegations of perjury by the prosecution's witnesses were unfounded.

The court sustained defendant's demurrer and dismissed the complaint, and the state appealed. The court affirmed the lower court's order because &sect; 4500 unduly interfered with the exercise of free speech under U.S. Const. amend. I. The court determined that the permit requirements of the ordinance failed to specify what standards other than truthfulness of the application could be used to assess the probability of fraud, and left that assessment to the absolute discretion of the chief of police. The court held that this type of broad administrative discretion had been repeatedly condemned, and the police chief's power under &sect; 4500 rendered the ordinance unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After real party in interest driver was arrested for violation of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23102, misdemeanor drunk driving, his repeated requests for a chemical blood test were denied and he was given a breath test. His motion to suppress pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5 was denied by the trial court but was granted upon review. On the state's appeal the court found that the suppression motion was actually a common law suppression motion because it rested on claimed constitutional violations other than unconstitutional search and seizure. Further, the denial of the blood test was a denial of due process where it prevented the obtaining of necessary evidence. Thus, the breath test results were inadmissible at trial. However, there was no unconstitutional search and seizure. Finally, the court found that a denial of a common law suppression motion was unreviewable pretrial, so the order was reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 654, because the notion that appellant engaged in an indivisible course of conduct and committed but one offense was a question of fact that appellant waived by his nolo contendere plea.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first degree murder and two counts of first degree robbery, while armed and using a firearm, and he was found sane. Defendant challenged. The court held that the arrest was lawful because the officers had probable cause, and a warrant was not required. Defendant's confession was illegally obtained because the officers used coercive tactics and impliedly threatened him. Furthermore, defendant's Miranda rights were violated because he invoked his privilege against self-incrimination when he requested to turn off the tape recorder and to speak with an officer alone in complete privacy. However, the admission of the confession was harmless because of the overwhelming evidence and the many properly admitted confessions. The jury was not required to agree on the theory by which it found defendant guilty for the verdict to have been unanimous. There was no error in the failure to give an instruction on the correct insanity test during the sanity phase. When the jury rejected defendant's diminished capacity defense, they necessarily rejected the evidence that might have supported an insanity verdict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After defendant's motion to suppress evidence was denied, defendant pled guilty and was convicted of second degree burglary, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 459. Defendant appealed, arguing the evidence against him was illegally obtained by a private citizen acting jointly with a police officer in a warrantless search. The court held that the private citizen was a participant in a joint operation with police because there was official participation in the warrantless search of defendant's vehicle. The court found that because the private citizen's entry into defendant's car furthered a state interest in addition to his own interest, it was part of the joint operation and constituted state action. As the private citizen's intrusion into defendant's car was prohibited under both the federal and California Constitutions, and as the private citizen's actions constituted state action, the evidence was illegally seized and should have been suppressed. Defendant's conviction was therefore reversed.</SPAN></P>

Appellants then brought an action for conversion and respondent filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court approved the motion and appellants sought review. On review the court affirmed. The court held that respondent's perfected security interest in the cattle prevailed over appellants' ownership interests in the cattle pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 2980.5. Further, respondent did not have notice of appellants' interests because they failed to record their agreement with the farm, as required by Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 2980.5.

Plaintiff was dismissed for the possession conviction, defendant board denied his petition for reconsideration, and the trial court denied his petition for mandate.

The court issued the opinion to demonstrate its reasoning to the Supreme Court of California regarding the timeliness of the lower court's order denying petitioner's rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner, a minor, was charged with assault with the intent to murder and assault with a deadly weapon. The state moved for a finding of unfitness under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 707. Petitioner was found unfit. Petitioner's counsel requested a rehearing under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 252. One of three court reporters requested an extension of time to file his portion of the fitness hearing transcript. It was extended until four days past the statutory time period in which a ruling on a petition for rehearing was to be acted upon. The statute required that if an application for rehearing was not granted, denied, or extended within 20 days following the date of its receipt, it was deemed granted. On the same day on which the transcript was delivered, the 24th day, the petition for rehearing was denied. Petitioner contended that the petition for rehearing should have been deemed granted by operation of law on the 20th day, and that the lower court's order extending the time period was without good cause. The court disagreed and denied the writ of mandate. The court found that the reporter needed four days to complete the transcript, a showing of good cause for extension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court denied the petition for writ of mandate. The court held that good cause for the extension of the 20-day deadline on which to rule on a petition for rehearing was found in the court reporter's inability to file the transcript within the 20 days. Therefore, a four-day extension was permissible and did not require an automatic granting of petitioner's petition for rehearing in the lower court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant, a minor, was placed home on probation pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 602 for having violated Los Angeles, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 63.94. The trial court found that defendant had unlawfully trespassed upon the grounds of a public school, a misdemeanor. Defendant argued that the municipal code provision was unconstitutional because it was in conflict with the general law which fully occupied the field and because it was vague, thereby violating his rights to due process of law. The court reversed the lower court's judgment. The court held that the general laws with respect to trespass upon school grounds did not preempt the field so as to preclude local regulation of trespassory conduct. However, defendant's demurrer to the petition should have been sustained. Los Angeles, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 63.94 imposed a criminal sanction for &quot;trespass in or upon the grounds of any public school.&quot; It did not, however, define &quot;trespass.&quot; There were numerous statutes regulating trespassory conduct on schoolyards that criminalized various conduct. The charge of &quot;trespass&quot; therefore failed to inform defendant of the particular offense with which he was charged.</SPAN></P>

The exemption of &sect; 690.31 could not be applied retroactively where the abstract of judgment was filed before the effective date of the statute. The court found that the abstract of judgment was recorded more than two years before the dwelling house exemption statute was enacted and six years before defendant recorded the declaration of homestead. Recording an abstract of judgment with the county recorder created a lien on all nonexempt property of the judgment debtor in that county.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed from the order of the Superior Court of El Dorado County (California), which convicted defendant of rape and oral copulation. The trial court sentenced defendant to state prison for a term of three years for the rape and stayed imposition of sentence on two counts of oral copulation, the stay to become permanent upon completion of the sentence for rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was charged with sexually assaulting two girls at knifepoint. The trial court convicted defendant after a jury found defendant guilty of two counts of oral copulation, and one count of rape. The trial court sentenced defendant to three years in state prison on the rape, and stayed the remaining sentences contingent upon completion of the sentence for rape. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court declined to upset the jury's finding that the victims were telling the truth, and that defendant's contention that the sex was consensual was false. No inferences needed to be drawn from the evidence, and there was nothing inherently improbable about the victims' testimony. Statutory preclusion of probation for persons convicted of rape by threat was not cruel and unusual punishment. The propensity for violence and threat to society in crimes of defendant's type were clear and were proper considerations in precluding probation. Nor was the preclusion of probation for rapists a violation of equal protection. The court held that persons convicted of different crimes were not similarly situated for equal protection purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant's conviction and sentences were affirmed. There was sufficient evidence upon which a rational jury could find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, regardless of the fact that the bulk of the state's evidence came from the testimony of the victims and was contradicted by defendant. The statutory preclusion of probation for rapists constituted neither cruel and unusual punishment nor a violation of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff, who purchased a home from defendant state department of veterans affairs, appealed the ruling of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) that defendant could assess late charges pursuant to Cal. Mil. &amp; Vet. Code &sect; 986.9. He also argued that the late charge policy violated the Administrative Procedure Act and that the requirement that he pay the expenses of notice to other class members violated U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the trial court's finding that defendant state department of veterans affairs was authorized to assess late charges against plaintiff and other class members who purchased homes from it, finding that while Cal. Mil. &amp; Vet. Code &sect; 986.9 allowed for such charges, the sales contracts did not specifically provide for them, although they enumerated other charges, such as taxes and insurance, to be paid in addition to the regular monthly installment payments. Therefore, it concluded, principles of contract interpretation compelled reversal of the order. The court also rejected defendant's argument that its late charge policy did not have to be adopted in the manner provided by the Administrative Procedure Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11370 et seq., finding that it was a rule of general application under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11371(b). It rejected plaintiff's argument that requiring him to advance the expenses of notice to the class violated his right to petition under U.S. Const. amend. I, finding that plaintiff had not been denied access to the courts and could have proceeded with an individual rather than a class action if he chose not to advance the expenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the trial court's finding that defendant state department of veterans affairs could assess late charges against plaintiff and other buyers of defendant's homes, finding that the charges were not contractually authorized. It remanded the case, also finding that defendant's late charge policy was subject to the Administrative Procedure Act and that requiring plaintiff to advance the costs of class notice was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
