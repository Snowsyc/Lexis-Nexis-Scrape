<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions and sentences entered in the Marion County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) upon his guilty plea to three counts of rape involving a minor less than 13 years of age and four counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance. Defendant also challenged his classification as a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in sentencing him on three counts of rape because his plea was not knowingly and intelligently made. The court disagreed, holding that the trial court properly convicted and sentenced defendant on three counts of rape even though two of the rape counts were based on conduct that occurred on one occasion but that involved two different sexual acts. The court concluded that defendant's guilty plea was voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made and that defendant received a fair sentencing hearing. Accordingly, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. However, the court reversed and vacated that portion of the judgment that declared defendant a sexual predator because the court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09, which classified defendants as sexual predators, should not have been applied retroactively. However, despite the court's conclusion in this regard, the court found that the trial court's pronouncement on the sexual predator issue did not prejudicially affect defendant's sentences as the offenses themselves.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with more than 160 separate counts arising out of alleged acts of sexual conduct with a number of young girls from 1992 through 1995. The jury found him guilty of gross sexual imposition with three victims. The crimes occurred when defendant was babysitting the victims. Defendant alleged that the State failed to prove a touching with the specific intent of sexual arousal or gratification. Defendant alleged that his conviction was improper as to the youngest child because the child could not testify as to the date of the offense. The court held that there were sufficient objective facts from which the jury could infer that defendant committed the prohibited acts with the specific intent of arousal or gratification of sexual desire. The State could prove such intent by circumstantial evidence. The court held that defendant was not prejudiced by the failure of the youngest victim to establish the dates of the offenses against her. The testimony of the child's older sister and her grandmother were sufficient to establish the time of the offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was involved in an accident while operating a snowmobile on his farm. The rescue squad summoned a deputy sheriff, who arrested appellant for operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol and operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol level of one tenth of one percent or more. The trial court denied appellant's motion to suppress evidence and found him guilty of both crimes charged. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the deputy's investigation of the accident did not infringe upon appellant's constitutional rights. The court concluded that the investigation occurred in a field accessible to and viewable by the public, where a person would have much less expectation of privacy than inside a private home, and that it was the deputy's duty to protect persons and property. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19 was not unconstitutionally vague because it was directed to persons operating &quot;any vehicle&quot; within the state and a person of ordinary intelligence was clearly informed that such conduct was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of a trial court (Ohio), in which he was adjudicated a sexual predator after being convicted of two counts of rape with regard to his teenaged daughter and her sister.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's ex post facto, double jeopardy, and vagueness constitutional challenges were overruled on the court's decision in another case. Defendant also contended that at the time he pled guilty, he did not know that he would be required to register for life with law enforcement. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and vacated in part. The court held that the registration law, which was created after defendant's pleas, might have created a collateral disability, but that, as a felon, defendant had no right to assume that his conduct would not be the target of future legislation. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not err in determining that defendant was a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 2950.01(E), 2909(B)(3), 2950.09(B)(2)(a-j). The court noted that, in addition to the victims being his daughter and her sister, defendant had an extensive history of alcohol abuse. Further, the court noted that, although defendant presented evidence of his completion of a program, the report demonstrated inadequate participation, unresolved anger, and no convincing way of dealing with the kinds of problems that resulted in his convictions in the first place.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed so much of the decision of the trial court that determined that defendant was a sexual predator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a mother of three minor children and fathers of two of the minor children, challenged the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division (Ohio), which awarded permanent custody of all three children to appellee Lucas County Children's Services Board (LCCSB) under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2151.353 and 2151.414.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's relationship with LCCSB began three years before the permanent custody hearing when her four-month old daughter was mauled by a dog. After an investigation, LCCSB provided the mother with training in parenting and housekeeping skills. A year later, the police were called when the mother's four-year old son was found wandering alone in a parking lot. Over the next year, LCCSB worked to improve the mother's skills.In 1994, the mother gave birth to another son. Subsequently, after a neighbor's report of neglect, the police transported the children, who were hungry and dirty, to LCCSB. LCCSB filed a complaint in dependency and neglect, and was awarded interim temporary custody. After an examination, the mother was found to be delusional. The fathers were incarcerated at the time of the petition and the children were placed in foster care. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the evidence showed that the mother had a severe mental illness that rendered her unable to provide an adequate permanent home, that the children were adoptable, and that the children's relationship with their fathers, who were in prison, was minimal under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.414.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, plead no contest to two counts of aggravated robbery. Defendant's case had been transferred from the juvenile court under the mandatory bindover law, Ohio Rev.

Defendant claimed that the juvenile court erred in failing to find that &sect; 2151.26(B) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that the mandated transfer provision of &sect; 2151.26(B) did not violated defendant's right to due process of law by depriving him of an &quot;adequate hearing&quot; on the issue of his amenability to treatment in the juvenile system because amenability was not an issue determinative of transfer when that the underlying offense was found to be one that &sect; 2901.01(A)(9) defined as an offense of violence. Further, the court held that &sect; 2151.26(B) did not conflict with Ohio Juv. R. P. 30. Also, the court held that &sect; 2151.26(B) was not incompatible with any provision of the Ohio Constitution.

The document showing the results of the genetic test was authenticated by a lab director's testimony under Ohio R. Evid. 901. The document was also self-authenticating under Rule 902(8). The court also found that the trial court was only required to mail a copy of the results of the genetic testing to the father because he was not represented by counsel when the results of the test were filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the County of Summit Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which adjudicated him a sexual predator under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09. He pled guilty to one count of sexual battery with a physical harm specification in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.03 and one count of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.31(A)(1), which were both third degree felonies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an adult but the victim was a minor. He testified that that the abuse occurred once but had earlier admitted that the abuse continued over a period of years. He testified that she initiated the sexual encounter. The trial court convicted defendant. The court affirmed. The registration and notification requirements of Ohio's sexual predator statutes did not violate the United States Constitution's prohibition against ex post facto laws or the Ohio Constitution's prohibition against retroactive laws. Because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09 did not impose a punishment, it violated neither constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy nor Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2943.09. The court found factors in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(2) applied to defendant and were relevant to the finding that he was a sexual predator. The court found by clear and convincing evidence that defendant was a sexual predator under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09. The trial court specifically stated that it considered all of the relevant facts in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(2). The court held that the record supported the trial court's adjudication of defendant as a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee filed a complaint sounding in contract, promissory estoppel, intentional tort, and negligence against defendants, city, program, transit department, and board. The employee sought damages for his injuries received beyond workers' compensation benefits. The Common Pleas Court of Marion County (Ohio) granted summary judgment to the city and judgment as a matter of law to the program and board. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee maintained that a contract was formed between the city and the program to place youth in the transit garage for summer employment and to provide a safe working environment. He argued that he was an intended third party beneficiary of the contract and that placement on a garbage truck violated the contract. It did not appear that the documents constituted a formal contract between the city and the program. If the documents did form a contract, a breach of the contract did not occur. The employee was not an intended third party beneficiary. He was an incidental beneficiary and had no privileges of enforcement. His breach of contract claims failed. Because evidence existed to support the program's participation in the workers' compensation system, the immunity conferred to participating employers by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.74 applied. Promissory estoppel was inapplicable to the circumstances. The city and the board were engaged in a governmental function and the immunity doctrine applied to the negligence claims. He failed to establish, as a matter of law, that the program possessed the requisite knowledge to be accountable for an employer intentional tort.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted rape and felonious assault, and was later adjudicated a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950. Defendant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in part. Citing appellate authority, the court rejected defendant's claims that ch. 2950 violated the ex post facto, double jeopardy, and retroactivity provisions of the federal and the Ohio constitutions, and citing the same authority overruled defendant's claim that ch. 2950 was void for vagueness. The court rejected defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his adjudication as a sexual predator, noting that the record supported the trial court's determination that defendant was likely to commit another sexual offense. The court found, however, that the trial court lacked the authority to order the county sheriff to obtain certain information from defendant while he was incarcerated at a state correctional facility, and therefore vacated that portion of the judgment that required the sheriff to process defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officials filed a motion to dismiss the prisoner's appeal, claiming that the prisoner failed to comply with the requirements of Ohio Rev.

The court found that the prisoner materially misstated the number of civil actions in his affidavit and granted the officials' motion to dismiss the appeal. Noting that the prisoner had filed as many as 44 pro se cases or appeals and demonstrated a pattern of asserting claims involving matters previously decided, the court nevertheless denied the officials' motion for ancillary relief asking the court to impose restrictions on the prisoner's ability to file future actions before the court in forma pauperis. The court declined to impose a prospective restriction on future filings based on Ohio Rev.

S.B. 2 (Ohio 1996), she should have been sentenced in accordance with the sentencing provisions in effect at the time of her sentence that reduced her crime to a misdemeanor. The trial court did not err in refusing to sentence defendant according to S.B. 2 because an amendment to the bill that including a &quot;notwithstanding&quot; clause required that she be sentenced in accordance with the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code in effect at the time of her offense. The court agreed with the majority of Ohio appellate courts that had considered the issue that the &quot;notwithstanding&quot; clause was an exception to, rather than an unconstitutional amendment of, Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2929.41 were self-executing. The court ruled that the trial court did not commit plain error when it sentenced defendant for both rape and gross sexual imposition because there were five intervening acts or events sufficient to justify separate sentences. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by imposing fines upon defendant because defendant failed to produce evidence indicating indigency prior to sentencing and failed to object to the fines imposed. The court ruled that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 et seq. did not violate Ohio's constitutional provision against retroactive legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lessees sought review of a judgment from the Ottawa County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which dismissed their declaratory judgment action against appellee Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) concerning the lease of certain property along Lake Erie.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessees leased submerged land lying adjacent to their property from the ODNR. The lease was for a term of 50 years commencing on January 1, 1987, with an annual rent of $ 5,000 for the first 10 years. At the end of the 10 years, the lease permitted the ODNR to adjust the rent to reflect any variation in property values. However, the ODNR was required to give the lessees 90 days notice of the increase. When the lessees tendered a $ 5,000 check for their 1997 rent, the check was cashed. In February 1997, however, they received a reimbursement check and an invoice from the ODNR demanding $ 33,297.26 as rent for the year. The rent increase was based on Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1501-6-06 (1992). Upon review, the court found that the trial court erred in dismissing the lessees' complaint. The utilization of the administrative code method on the lease was a retroactive application which was statutorily and constitutionally abhorrent. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.03 made an action for declaratory judgment the appropriate vehicle for adjudicating the rights and relations of the parties to a contract as well as the way those rights were affected by a statute or a rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the cause was remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with the judgment. The ODNR was ordered to pay the costs of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of sexual battery and was sentenced to one year of incarceration. While still in prison, defendant was returned to the trial court for a sexual-predator hearing under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950. The trial court determined that defendant was not a sexual predator but labeled him a sexually oriented offender. Defendant appealed, contending that chapter 2950 was unconstitutional. The court disagreed, holding that: (1) &sect; 2950.09 required the trial court to determine by clear and convincing evidence whether a sexually oriented offender was a sexual predator; (2) this did not deny defendant due process because it was presumed that the burden of proof was on the state to show by clear and convincing evidence that an individual was likely to commit another sexually oriented offense; (3) there is no rational basis for the registration requirement as applied to an individual like defendant who, according to the trial court's determination, was not a sexual predator; however, (4) there was not an order in the record requiring defendant to register as required under chapter 2950.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff union appealed the decision from the Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which affirmed the decision of defendant State Employment Relations Board (SERB) finding that the union violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4117.11(B)(7) and (8). The union argued that the picketing statutes were unconstitutional. Intervenor Ohio Turnpike Commission (Commission) entered the suit on behalf of the SERB.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union sought to organize the Commission's workers. The union picketed the home of the director of the Commission. The two statutes prohibited picketing of a private residence of an employer and prohibited picketing without prior notice. On appeal, the court found the statutes unconstitutional. The picketing was in a public street, which accorded it a high degree of First Amendment protection since a street was a public forum.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4117.11(B)(7) was also content-based since it applied to labor disputes, and thus a strict scrutiny test applied. The SERB could not establish a compelling state interest. Protecting privacy, encouraging citizens to serve as agency officials, and maintaining labor peace were not &quot;compelling.&quot; Nor did the SERB show that the statute was narrowly tailored. Other ordinances and laws existed to maintain order. The second statute was a prior restraint. The strict scrutiny standard applied for this reason and because the statute was not content-neutral. The purpose of the statute, that of a cooling off period in labor disputes, was not a compelling interest. A 10-day notice requirement was not narrowly tailored.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed. Two labor picketing statutes were unconstitutional. Since both referred to labor picketing, they were not content-neutral. A strict scrutiny test thus applied, and the SERB could not establish a compelling state interest to justify either statute. Furthermore, the statutes were not narrowly tailored to fit the compelling interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court determined that defendant was a sexually oriented offender subject to the registration requirements of Ohio Rev.

Defendant appealed, claiming that the application of the statutes to him violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution and the Retroactive Clause of the Ohio Constitution because his conviction predated the effective date of the statutes. On appeal, the court found that the legislature intended the registration statutes to be regulatory in nature. The statutes did not impose a greater punishment on defendant than the law as written when he committed the crime. The court found that defendant had no reasonable expectation of finality or vested rights with regard to his past felonious conduct. He could not expect that his conduct would never be the subject of future legislation. In that regard, the court found that the reporting requirements were remedial in nature rather than punitive. The court held that non-punitive, remedial statutes did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause or the Retroactive Clause.</SPAN></P>

The wife alleged that she had paid the husband's union dues, liability coverage for the automobile he was driving, and his health insurance expenses, which precluded her from paying the real estate taxes on the marital properties. The husband was awarded spousal support, which he claimed was inadequate to cover his expenses. The court affirmed the award because the court examined his limited means of support and it was not necessary for the wife to cover all or most of his expenses.

The magistrate held that the zoning board granted the builders area variances, not a permit for a PUD, and thus, the issue of the PUD provision's constitutionality was irrelevant to the case. Furthermore, the magistrate found that the land owners neither claimed that the variance was unconstitutional nor that the zoning board improperly granted the variances. Accordingly, the magistrate dismissed the complaint and the trial court adopted the decision as its own.

It also declined defendant's penalty phase contentions that the death penalty was unconstitutional, that his right to present a defense was improperly infringed, that he could not legally be sentenced to die since he was merely a coconspirator, that the prosecutor's penalty phase argument was inflammatory, that the penalty phase instructions were incorrect, that a hearing into juror intimidation was erroneously denied, and that a penalty-phase mistrial was required due to juror deadlock.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of public indecency, he appealed. The court affirmed. Based on the evidence presented at trial, the court said that any rational trier of fact could have found all the elements of the offense of public indecency proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution presented sufficient evidence to establish that defendant's conduct was likely to be viewed by, and to affront, others not members of defendant's household. Even if a police officer witness was not affronted, it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that others using the park facilities were likely to be affronted by defendant's masturbatory activity. The testimony was sufficient to establish that defendant engaged in masturbation for the purpose of sexual self-gratification. Sufficient evidence established that his conduct was likely to be viewed by others using park facilities. The trial court did not err in determining that defendant had not met his burden of establishing entrapment as an affirmative defense. Defendant waived his argument that the statute was unconstitutional by failing to raise the argument at the trial court level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the prisoner contended that the trial court erred in finding that no remedy existed for a court to review the discretionary decision of the board to deny the prisoner parole. The prisoner also argued that the doctrines of collateral estoppel and double jeopardy precluded the board from considering the prisoner's offense and prior criminal conduct in considering whether to grant parole. The court held that: (1) the decision to deny the prisoner parole was not subject to judicial review because he did not assert that he was denied parole for a constitutionally impermissible reason; (2) neither double jeopardy nor collateral estoppel prevented the board from considering the nature and circumstances of the offense giving rise to the prisoner's conviction because the underlying conviction was separate from the administrative proceedings concerning parole; and (3) the parole guidelines were not required to be promulgated in accordance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 111.15, 119.03(I) because the guidelines were not rules and did not limit the discretion granted to the board under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.03.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of committing felonious assault in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.11. He filed a motion for a protective order and a petition for declaratory judgment against the State. Defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2901.21(C)(1), 2901.05(A), 2901.05(C) were unconstitutional as being vague and unreasonable. Defendant also sought an interpretation by the court of the statutory language &quot;conduct of a certain nature&quot; that was found in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2901.22(A)-(E), and the term &quot;possession&quot; as used in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.21(C)(1). The Attorney General filed a motion to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court sustained the Attorney General's motion, finding that defendant lacked standing. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion because there was no case or controversy between the parties which was justiciable in nature sufficient to warrant relief under the declaratory judgment act, and because defendant had an adequate, alternative remedy at law to challenge the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured's father was killed in a car accident in Florida.

The insured then filed an action for declaratory judgment claiming that she was entitled to recover for her father's wrongful death under the UIM provision of the policy issued to her by the insurer. The trial court granted summary judgment for the insurer. The court affirmed the summary judgment. The court held that because the accident occurred in Florida, the substantive law of Florida applied in determining whether the insured was legally entitled to recover damages from the driver. Under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 768.21(1), the insured was not entitled to recover damages from the driver as a result of her father's wrongful death, and thus, the insurer was not obligated to make any payments to the insured under the UIM provision of her policy. The court further held that Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered and the trial court accepted a plea of no contest to the charges of rape, gross sexual imposition, and corruption of a minor.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Because defendant was not found to have been a sexual predator, the trial court's judgment simply pointed to what defendant was required to do upon his release from prison, pursuant to the definitions of Ohio Rev.

He argued that the State withheld exculpatory evidence in deprivation of his constitutional rights. He also claimed that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions and death sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. In his postconviction motion, he argued that the State withheld exculpatory evidence of a witness's statement given to police and the grand jury. He argued that the statements, which were that the witness did not overhear defendant confessing to killing the victim to his girlfriend, were exculpatory. On appeal, the court held the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the State. The court ruled that the witness's statements were not favorable to defendant, rather they bolstered the girlfriend's testimony that the witness was not present when defendant told her that he killed the victim. Thus, the court determined, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the statements contained nothing material to the defense. The court further held that defendant was not deprived of effective assistance of counsel based on counsel's representation of defendant at trial and his simultaneous representation of the witness in an unrelated matter. The court concluded that there was no evidence of an actual conflict of interest adversely affecting counsel's representation of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual battery, gross sexual imposition, and rape. After he was sentenced, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction recommended that he be determined to be a sexual predator pursuant to &sect; 2950.09(C). After a hearing, the trial court adjudicated defendant a sexual predator. Defendant's motion to dismiss was overruled. Defendant appealed. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 did not violate the Ohio constitutional prohibition against retroactive legislation because its application did not impair or take away any vested rights, affect an accrued substantive right, or impose new or additional burdens, duties, obligations or liabilities based upon past conduct. The statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution because it treated all offenders equally and, under the rational-basis test, it bore a rational relationship to the legitimate governmental interest of protecting the public from sex offenders. The court found that there was sufficient clear and convincing evidence in the record to support the trial court's determination that defendant was a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City declared defendant's home a public nuisance after a police search discovered drugs and firearms. A lower court determined the premises to be a public nuisance and defendant did not challenge the order until after the time set for an appeal to the Nuisance Appeals Board. The criminal charges stemmed from defendant's failure to vacate the home as required by the nuisance notice. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case. The court held as follows: 1) defendant's avenue to challenge the nuisance order's validity was through an appeal to the Nuisance Appeals Board, or possibly to the common pleas court if he believed exhaustion of administrative appeals was unnecessary for presentation of his constitutional arguments; 2) defendant was precluded from raising issues related to the nuisance order's validity as a defense to criminal charges for violating the order because he failed to appeal the order in a timely manner and to the proper appellate body; and 3) the trial court erred in dismissing the charges because the issue of whether defendant's residence should have been declared a public nuisance was not properly before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court held that the trial court erred in admitting the court reporter's testimony to establish that appellant failed to appear at a status conference because such testimony did not fall within the hearsay exception for public records where the court reporter had no personal knowledge of the event described in the report. However, the court held that the admission of the court' reporter's testimony was harmless in light of the fact that the hearsay testimony had already been presented to the jury through the testimony of another witness without objection. With regard to defendant's allegation of misjoinder, the court held that defendant waived any error on the part of the court in failing to sever the offenses when defendant failed to object at trial. Moreover, the three offenses arose from, or were committed as part of, a common course of criminal conduct such that joinder was proper under Ohio R. Crim. P. 8(A).</SPAN></P>

The coverage was sought after the insured's father died in Florida as a result of a car accident in which the other driver was potentially underinsured because his carrier had already paid his policy limit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured's father was killed in a car accident in Florida. The estate filed and action against the other driver in Florida and was awarded the maximum of the other driver's policy. The insured then brought a declaratory action against the insurer for underinsured-motorist coverage from his own policy. The trial court granted summary judgment to the insurer, and the insured appealed. The court affirmed the judgment from below. The insured contended that the trial court had applied Florida law but that Ohio law should have been applied to determine whether or not he was entitled to recover damages from the tortfeasor for the father's wrongful death. The court disagreed. The presumption was that the law of the place of the injury controlled unless another jurisdiction had a more significant relationship to the lawsuit. To determine the state with the most significant relationship, a number of factors were to be considered. Although the contractual relationship between the insured and the insurer was formed in Ohio and the insurer did business in Ohio, and the insured was domiciled there, these facts were insufficient to overcome the presumption.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the area in which plaintiff's property was located was zoned residential. Disallowing a business in a residential area was directly related to preserving the area as a residential area.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father filed an action to determine parentage of the mother's daughter. The father also sought shared parenting. The mother filed a motion to dismiss and asserted that the father failed to follow the administrative procedures of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111 et seq. In response, the father filed a motion to find that &sect; 3111 et seq. was unconstitutional. The trial court determined that the father was the child's natural father and also determined that the father lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statutes because he was permitted to file his action without the prior administrative proceedings and thus, suffered no injury. Accordingly, the trial court granted the mother's motion and denied the motion by the father. The father appealed and the court dismissed the appeal. The court found that the ruling on the father's motion did not determine the action and was not a final appealable order as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2505.02. Various issues remained to be determined in the case, such as shared parenting and child support, before any judgment would be final and appealable.</SPAN></P>

The trial court carefully considered the factors set out in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.12 before sentencing defendant and properly concluded that given defendant's criminal history, the fact that defendant was not amenable to community control sanctions, and the fact that a prison term would be consistent with the purposes of sentencing, a prison term was warranted. Imposing a driver's license suspension to run consecutively with any other license suspension was proper under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(G) when read in conjunction with Ohio Rev.

The court held that the provisions of , providing for the imposition of a reduced penalty if such penalties were reduced before sentencing, were specifically exempted by explicit language in and that the specific language in the bill took precedence over the general language in Ohio Rev.

Defendant then filed a motion for judicial release, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.20, or alternatively for &quot;supershock parole,&quot; pursuant to Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2929.20. Section 2929.20 did not apply to defendant because he was sentenced prior to the statute's effective date. Further, the court held that the fact that S.B. 2 (Ohio 1996) only applied prospectively posed an equal protection problem. The parole system prior to S.B. 2 was still available to defendant because the legislature preserved the parole system for those convicted and sentenced prior to July 1, 1996.</SPAN></P>

Upon appeal, he contended, inter alia, that he was prejudiced by the trial court's refusal to change venue. The court disagreed, holding that pretrial publicity was not enough, standing alone, to warrant a change of venue. Appellant further claimed prejudice in the trial court's refusal to grant his motion to suppress, contending there had been Miranda violations. The court disagreed, finding that Miranda was not implicated because appellant was not in custody. Merely advising an individual of his Miranda rights did not necessarily imply custodial interrogation. Appellant's claim of a violation to prosecute timely was rebuffed because he had failed to assert a violation of his speedy trial right or of his due process rights in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The common pleas limited the evidence of nonsupport to after the paternity determination, dismissed the adoption, and denied a motion for new trial. The custodial parents appealed. The court affirmed. The custodial parents were not entitled to a new trial based on the exclusion of the evidence of nonsupport prior to the paternity determination, because the evidence was properly excluded under binding precedent. Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3107.07(B) was inapplicable to the father because he was an adjudicated parent. Due process and equal protection were not violated by the restriction on admissibility of nonsupport, because there was no fundamental right to step-parent adoption, not all the children affected were illegitimate, &sect; 3107.07(B) was rationally related to the state's interest of a father's support of his child. The exclusion of evidence had not violated the custodial parents' procedural due process rights because the state had a valid reason for limiting the relevant evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court conducted a classification hearing pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09 and determined that defendant was a sexual predator. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the trial court did not err by admitting hearsay evidence during defendant's sexual predator classification hearing because a sexual predator classification hearing was similar to hearings for sentencing and granting or revoking probation where the rules of evidence, including the hearsay rule, were inapplicable. The court noted that a classification hearing did not occur until after defendant was convicted of the underlying offense and that it was not intended to determine his guilt or innocence but whether he was likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses. The court found that because a classification hearing for sexual offenders was an informal hearing, the rules of evidence did not apply and reliable hearsay evidence was admissible.</SPAN></P>

Section 6103.04 was not a general law because it affected only municipalities. Section 6103.04 specifically sought to regulate the construction and ownership of a utility in an area which became incorporated as, or annexed to, a municipal corporation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant sought an award of reparations from the Victim's Division of the Ohio Court of Claims after her 14-year-old daughter was the victim of a sexual assault. While the claim was still pending, the claimant's daughter was convicted of a felony. A panel awarded the claimant reparations, and the Attorney General objected. Prior to a hearing, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.60(E) was amended, precluding awards for persons convicted of a felony. The panel reversed and denied the claim. The claimant appealed to the Court of Claims, which affirmed the decision. The claimant sought a writ of mandamus. The court held that the retroactive application of amended &sect; 2743.60(E) to claims pending before the effective date of the amendment did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The amendment involved a procedural change rather than one attaching a new disability to a past transaction or consideration. The court concluded that the statute was rationally related to the legitimate purpose of conserving limited state resources and there was a rational basis to deny benefits to a family member of a victim when the victim had committed a felony during the pendency of the claim.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the record did not support defendant's contention that the victim was released unharmed because the fact that she was raped was ample evidence of harm. The court found no prejudice resulting to defendant by the language of the bill of particulars. Whether the jury found that the kidnapping occurred during the rape or after did not affect the integrity of the jury's unanimous verdict because the jury's options in the case did not fall beyond the constitutional bounds of fundamental fairness and rationality. The court found the evidence in the case sufficient to support defendant's conviction under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2905.01(A)(2), (3),(4). The court found no evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court had a reasonable basis for imposing the sentences that it did with the possible exception of the maximum penalty assessed for the robbery charge.

The court overruled defendants' assignments of error, holding that none of them had standing to challenge the statute, as none of them had alleged an injury in fact by operation of the statute. Standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute required demonstration of a concrete injury in fact, rather than an abstract or suspected injury. None had alleged that they had been subjected to an extension of prison time pursuant to the bad-time provision of the statute, nor had any of defendants alleged that they had been made subject to post-release control sanctions. Therefore, the court could not find that the complained of error, which was not raised in the trial court, was plain error, and that consideration was warranted by the rights and interests involved. Accordingly, defendants waived any error by failing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court also held the trial court did not abuse its discretion in binding defendant, who was 17 years old when he committed the offenses, over to the adult court. The juvenile court had a wide discretion in determining a defendant's amenability to rehabilitation pursuant to Ohio R. Juv. P. 30(F). A psychologist testified that defendant was of low, average intelligence. He had a prior juvenile record and was on probation at the time of the offense. Defendant had been expelled from school for insubordination.

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, and that judgment was affirmed by the supreme court. The Supreme Court of the United States denied certiorari. Defendant filed a petition for postconviction relief pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21, asserting 22 claims that his constitutional rights were violated. The court reversed the order of the trial court that dismissed the petition because the trial court failed to specifically address some of defendant's 22 claims of error, and the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law were insufficient to inform either defendant or the court of the basis for the trial court's decision and precluded effective appellate review. The court held that the trial court should have held a hearing on defendant's petition to disqualify the county prosecutor's office because defendant's trial counsel had gone to work for the prosecutor's office while defendant's case was on appeal, and there was a presumption that the attorney had shared information with his new employer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Common Pleas Court, Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which overruled his request for a declaratory judgment on his motion to terminate his imprisonment. He was convicted and sentenced in two separate cases which were consolidated for purposes of appeal. He had not directly appealed either of his convictions. A separate appeal was pending from the trial court's denial of his petition for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a declaratory judgment request seeking retroactive application of the new sentencing guidelines and termination of his incarceration, which the trial court overruled. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the new criminal felony sentencing statutes, which became effective on July 1, 1996. In particular, he claimed that the enactment violated U.S. Const. amends. V, VIII, XIV, and Ohio Const. art. I. Defendant argued that because he had been denied equal protection and due process, the remaining period of his incarceration should be terminated immediately. In compliance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21, defendant had properly filed with the trial court a petition for postconviction relief and a petition to vacate sentence. Following the trial court's denial of his postconviction petition, defendant filed an appeal, which was currently pending. The court held that defendant improperly filed a motion for declaratory judgment to challenge the constitutionality of the sentencing guidelines as well as to seek immediate termination of his remaining prison sentence. The court therefore declined to rule on defendant's assignments of error and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision of the Akron Municipal Court, County of Summit, Ohio, which convicted him of two counts of public indecency in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.09. He claimed the trial court incorrectly convicted and sentenced him on two counts of public indecency because only one act of public indecency occurred, and incorrectly sentenced him without the presence of him or his counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two juvenile girls visited defendant's apartment. He answered the door only wearing a towel. The girls claimed that defendant showed them a program containing nudity and sexual activity and, as they were leaving to avoid watching the program, he removed his towel, exposing his private parts. He was charged with two counts of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles and two counts of public indecency. He was found not guilty of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles and guilty on both counts of public indecency. On appeal, the court reversed in part, finding that the language in &sect; 2907.09, providing that no one could recklessly expose his or her private parts when it was likely that non-household members might view and be affronted by the exposure, proscribed certain conduct without regard to the effect it actually had on others and without regard to how many others actually viewed the behavior. As such, defendant's double conviction for his single act of exposing himself to the two girls could not stand. In addition, nothing in the record indicated defendant was present at the sentencing and it was error to deprive him of his right to be present at his sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court on one count of public indecency, affirmed defendant's conviction on one count of public indecency, and remanded the matter for resentencing on that conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the township trustees' actions of whispering and passing documents among themselves circumvented the intent of &sect; 121.22, and that they therefore failed to conduct an open meeting. The citizen argued that the lower court erred when it failed to make a finding as to whether a Sunshine Law violation occurred at a second meeting. The court sustained the citizen's assignment of error and remanded for the lower court to determine whether a violation of &sect; 121.22 occurred at the other meeting. The court concluded that the lower court also erred when it failed to order that all business conducted at the meeting in violation of &sect; 121.22 was void because it was not an open meeting and any actions were therefore invalid.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 3767.01 et seq., which, in this context, had been superseded by the requirement that applicants merely make a &quot;demonstration&quot; that the nuisance would be abated, (2) by relying on the statutory standard rather than the common law, the trial court had improperly extended the reach of the closure order to material that was presumptively protected by the First Amendment, (3) the store's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 counterclaim was properly dismissed because the claim began to accrue when the prosecutor first sent the letter to the store, and thus, the two-year period of limitations had run, and (4) the trial court's finding that the violation constituted a &quot;repeated violation&quot; of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were all convicted of various sexually oriented offenses. Pursuant to Ohio's Sexual Predator Law, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.04 et seq., they were adjudicated sexual predators upon a petition filed by the state. Defendants appealed and argued that the sexual predator law was unconstitutional because it violated their rights under the U.S. Const. amends. V, VIII, XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 9. On appeal, the court found that the state's sexual predator law was constitutional and that the evidence supported the trial court's decisions. The court reasoned that the classification of a defendant as a sexual predator did not violate any prohibitions against ex post facto laws or retro active legislation because the classification scheme were not punitive and did not impair any vested rights, or accrued substantive rights based on past conduct. Further, the classification scheme was not violative of equal protection principles because the law was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed his motion for a declaratory judgment and to modify his sentence pursuant to the sentencing guidelines enacted as part of Am. Sub. S.B. No. 2 (Ohio). The trial court found that Am. Sub. S.B. No. 2 (Ohio) was not to be applied retroactively. On appeal, the court affirmed finding that the trial court was precluded from entertaining appellant's motion pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2953.21 and 2953.23(A). The court indicated that because appellant was sentenced prior to September 21, 1995, and his trial transcript was filed in the court as part of his direct appeal three years prior to that, his postconviction petition was required to be filed with the trial court no later than September 21, 1996, in order to be timely. The court noted that appellant filed approximately one year late. Further, the court determined that the untimeliness of appellant's petition alone did not give the trial court an automatic right to dismiss the petition. The court explained that the untimely petition triggered an analysis under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.23(A). The court ruled that appellant's petition did not meet the criteria of that section.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed because &sect; 3937.18(A)(2) was constitutional. Ohio Const. art. 1, &sect; 16 was not violated because the right involved was not the constitutional right to a remedy but was only a right granted under a contract of insurance and limited by authorization of a statute. The legislature was free to redress its dissatisfaction of a supreme court decision with new legislation. In addition, the legislature, having granted automobile insurers the right to limit certain coverages, was not prohibited from altering that same right. Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed an order of the Butler County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which adjudicated defendant a sexual predator but concluded that the &quot;labeling&quot; as a sexual predator and subsequent community notification provisions of the sexual-predator law, Am. Sub. H.B. 180 (Ohio 1997), codified in part at Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950, violated ex post facto and retroactivity provisions of the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to gross sexual imposition and contributing to the unruliness of a minor. Subsequent to defendant's conviction and sentencing, but prior to his release from prison, Ohio's sexual-predator law became effective. The trial court ruled that defendant was a sexual predator. The trial court also concluded that the statute's &quot;labeling&quot; and community notification provisions were both punitive and substantive and, therefore, unconstitutional. The State contested the ruling that the &quot;labeling&quot; and notification provisions were unconstitutional as applied to offenders whose convictions predated the statute. The trial court's judgment was reversed. The court found that the classification and notification provisions were neither punitive nor substantive. The court ruled that as applied to offenders who were convicted and sentenced prior to the enactment of the statute and who were still in prison when the statute went into effect, the sexual predator classification provision and attendant registration and community notification requirements did not violate the federal prohibition against ex post facto laws nor Ohio's prohibition against retroactive legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) ruled that Ohio's amended sexual predator law, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.11, was unconstitutional as applied to defendant. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The acts that formed the basis of defendant's convictions for sexual imposition and illegally using a minor for nudity-oriented material or performance had occurred prior to the enactment and effective dates of &sect; 2950.11. The state argued that the notification requirements of &sect; 2950.11 violated neither the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution nor the retroactivity clause of the Ohio Constitution. Defendant did not provide the &quot;clearest proof&quot; that the legislature's stated no punitive intent had been negated by the statute's actual purpose or effects. Thus, the notification requirements did not violate U.S. Const. Art. I, &sect; 10. Because a sexual predator had no reasonable expectation of finality in his past felonious conduct, &sect; 2950.11 did not attach to it a new disability, and thus, did not offend the retroactivity clause. Defendant argued that &sect; 2950.11 was unconstitutionally vague. The court determined that persons of ordinary intelligence could have understood the definition of sexual predator set forth in &sect; 2950.01(E) and the factors set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950(B)(2).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in finding him to be a &quot;sexual predator&quot; based on insufficient evidence to overcome his Alford plea. Because the court concluded that classification as a sexual predator was not a penalty or punishment, it certainly was not arbitrary or unfair to subject defendant to a classification as a sexual predator as a consequence of his guilty plea to a sexually oriented offense. If defendant believed that the collateral consequence of being classified a sexual predator as a result of his guilty plea was too onerous, he was free to elect to stand trial rather than to enter such a plea. Defendant received a direct benefit from his Alford plea, the nolle of the more serious charge of rape by the State of Ohio. There also was nothing &quot;vague&quot; about the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(A), which provided that a person who pleaded guilty to a sexually oriented offense might have been classified as a sexual predator. Because the court had found that the registration and notification provisions of the sexual predator legislation could not be characterized as &quot;punishment,&quot; the legislation did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A homeowner went outside to investigate some noises. He saw that a car had slid off the road and hit two mailboxes and that it had come to rest in a snow bank. He also saw another car attached to the wrecked car by a cable, apparently trying to tow it. Further, he saw an individual, who he later identified as defendant, sitting in the driver's seat of the damaged car. The homeowner called the police. An officer responded and placed defendant under arrest. Defendant was subsequently found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol and operating a motor vehicle with a prohibited breath content. The court reversed defendant's convictions, holding that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant &quot;operated&quot; the vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. The court noted that the accident occurred several hours before defendant's arrest, when defendant was not intoxicated, and that when defendant was intoxicated, his car was completely immobile and had no potential for movement. The court thus found that defendant did not have control of the car and that he could not have used it to create a hazard to other persons or vehicles on the highway.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company purchased a tract of land. After purchasing the land, the company sought a zoning certificate from the zoning inspector to mine sand and gravel on its parcel. The inspector denied the request because the sand and gravel mining operation did not fall in the category of automatically permitted used in the R-2 residential zoning district. The inspector instructed the company to apply for a conditional zoning permit, which it did. After three public hearings, the Board denied the company's application for the permit. The company appealed to the court of common pleas, which reversed the determination and ordered the Board to issue the permit with certain conditions. The Board appealed, arguing, among other things, that the court of common pleas exceeded its authority by essentially re-writing the township's zoning resolution, substituting a preponderance standard of proof for the standard of proof contained in the language of the resolution, &quot;beyond reasonable doubt.&quot; The court held that it had uncovered no constitutional or statutory provision that precluded the township from imposing the standard of proof &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; to conditional zoning certificates.</SPAN></P>

The deputy arrested defendant after noticing the strong odor of alcohol on his breath, his bloodshot eyes, and his unsteadiness. Defendant was found to have a prohibited amount of alcohol in his breath under &sect; 4511.19(B)(2). Defendant made a motion to suppress the breathalyzer results, which was denied. He appealed, asserting that there was not enough evidence of his driving while intoxicated to establish probable cause for his arrest. In affirming, the court held that (1) at the suppression hearing, the deputy testified that he was aware of defendant's underage status; (2) the facts that constitute probable cause to arrest an underage driver are different from the facts necessary to constitute probable cause to arrest an adult driver; and (3) the arresting officer had probable cause to arrest defendant for driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

Defendant made a few payments that year, paid more five years later when he was found, and disappeared for nine more years. Defendant was arrested in another state for nonsupport of his dependents. Defendant was found guilty. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the trial court properly received evidence of the Ohio Child Support Enforcement Agency's collection efforts to show defendant's lack of support for his children. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant and so the trial court properly denied his motion for acquittal. The court noted that the fact that the children were provided for by others was not a defense to his failure to support them.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from the judgment of the Butler County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which determined that they were sexual predators. The State cross-appealed from the trial court's determination that certain provisions of the sexual predator law were unconstitutional when applied to defendants, all of whom were convicted and sentenced before the law was enacted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that certain portions of the sexual predator law, Am. Sub. H.B. 180 (Ohio 1997), were punitive and therefore could not be applied to defendants without violating the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution and the retroactive clause of the Ohio constitution. However, on appeal, the court, based upon an earlier opinion, held retroactive application of the statute to be constitutional. The court then held that the trial court had properly based its finding that one defendant was a sexual predator on a prior conviction because past behavior could be used to gauge future propensity to commit crimes. However, the court reversed a sexual predator determination of another defendant because he fell among the class of offenders described in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C) in that he pled guilty to and was sentenced for his offense prior to the effective date of the statute and was in prison after the effective date. Because he had not been adjudicated as a sexual predator prior to his release from prison, his adjudication as a sexual predator had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision insofar as it found retroactive application of the sexual predator law to be unconstitutional, affirmed the trial court's sexual predator determination as to three defendants, but reversed the trial court's sexual predator determination as to the fourth defendant.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that: (1) because the trial court was permitted to consider the evidence and to substitute its judgment to a limited extent for that of the board, it acted reasonably in finding that the board's decision was not supported by a preponderance of the evidence; (2) where the city and the territory to be annexed shared a common boundary, the territory would not create a strip or gerrymandered annexation, and the trial court acted reasonably in finding that the board's decision that the city and the territory were not contiguous was not supported by a preponderance of the evidence; (3) because two landowners did not follow the requisite procedures for removal of their names from the petition, their signatures should not have been removed in determining whether the annexation would further the general good of the territory.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court determined that the trial court properly dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court held that the applicant's right to appeal was statutory, and consequently, the applicant could only perfect his appeal in the mode prescribed by the statute. The applicant failed to exhaust his administrative remedies provided in &sect; 4141.28(L); therefore, the trial court was without jurisdiction to review the administrative decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio appealed an order of the Common Pleas Court of Hancock County (Ohio), which, after defendant was convicted of gross sexual imposition, held that application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09, the state sexual predator law, to defendant's case was unconstitutional because &sect; 2950.09 was enacted after the crime was committed. The State alleged that &sect; 2950.09 was not punishment that placed any major additional burden on defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to sexual imposition. The trial court sentenced him to two years in prison but refused to hold a hearing to determine if defendant was a sexual predator under &sect; 2950.09, holding that application of &sect; 2950.09 to defendant's case was unconstitutional because it was enacted after the crime was committed. The State appealed, alleging that the additional burdens placed on defendant by &sect; 2950.09 were miniscule and that &sect; 2950.09 was not punishment. The court, referring to its prior decision on the issue, held that application of &sect; 2950.09 to defendant's case was unconstitutional because it constituted retroactive application of a statute. Under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, the legislature had no power to pass retroactive laws, and any law that created a new obligation or duty attaching to a past transaction was deemed retroactive. Because Ohio Rev. Code Ann &sect; 2950.09 created new duties and attached new disabilities to offenses committed in the past, in the form of increased frequency of registration and the additional stigma of public notification, it affected a substantive right of defendant and could not be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order holding that application of the state sexual predator law was unconstitutional as applied to defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of domestic violence, both fifth degree felonies. The trial court sentenced him to two consecutive 11-month terms of imprisonment for the crimes. Defendant appealed his sentence and claimed that the trial court erred when it sentenced him to two consecutive 11-month terms of incarceration. The court affirmed the sentence imposed by the trial court. The court found that the trial court had imposed the sentences only after it had considered all the factors in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.12. The court determined that the seriousness of defendant's conduct was heightened under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.12(B)(2) because he had threatened to kill his wife and the seriousness of her physical and psychological harm. The court concluded that even assuming defendant had not caused his wife serious physical harm, given his continuous criminal history, the trial court had acted within its discretion when it imposed consecutive sentences in order to protect the public from the significant likelihood of future crime by him.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the employee's complaint finding that the employee failed to put forth a theory as to why the statute was unconstitutional. The court held that the employee did not overcome the presumption that the statute was constitutional and the trial court did not err in relying upon the statute in its conclusion that the employee failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court noted that if &sect; 2745.01 was unconstitutional on its face, then the employee's complaint might have withstood a challenge under Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6).

The question before the court was whether the amended &sect; 2953.36 was unconstitutional as applied to offenders who were convicted before its effective date, but who by law could not file motions to seal their records until after the effective date. The court answered the question negatively and vacated. The court found that at the time defendant entered his guilty plea, he had the opportunity to request that the record of his conviction be sealed. The court also noted that there was nothing in the record to suggest that defendant's decision to plead guilty gave any consideration to the possibility that he might have the record of his conviction sealed at a later date.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed an order from the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted defendant of aggravated robbery with a firearm specification. A complaint was originally filed in the juvenile court, but the case was transferred to the trial court after the State filed a motion so that defendant could be tried as an adult pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.26.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted as an adult for aggravated robbery with a firearm specification, and he appealed. Defendant claimed four assignments of error. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that under &sect; 2151.26(4)(B) the bindover of defendant to the trial court was mandatory and the investigative procedures outlined in Ohio R. Juv. P. 30 were not required. All that was necessary was for the juvenile court to find that probable cause existed that defendant committed the crime. The court held that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the crime. The State sustained its burden. The court determined that there were five factors to determine the reliability of an identification and that the factors were met in the case. The court ruled that the greater amount of the evidence presented by the State showed that the jury clearly was justified in its verdict. The conviction was supported by the manifest weight of the evidence. The court held that defendant waived his claim that &sect; 2151.26 was unconstitutionally vague because he had not raised the issue prior to the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, electoral and union organizations (organizations), and defendant government officials each appealed the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which found unconstitutional only that provision of the Ohio Campaign Finance Reform Act (Act) that placed limitations on the solicitation of contributions for a labor organization's political action committee, specifically Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3517.082(D).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ohio overhauled its campaign finance laws, especially as they pertained to how, and under what circumstances, public employees and union members could be solicited for political contributions or make use of such funds. The organizations filed suit. The trial court found only the provisions of &sect; 3517.082(D) to be unconstitutional; it upheld the remainder of the Act. On appeal, the court held that: (1) injunctive relief against the ban on public employees' voluntary political contributions by payroll deduction was in order because the provision was unconstitutional; (2) the ban on public employees' solicitation of political contributions while performing official duties or in an area where official business occurred was constitutional; (3) the ban on direct partisan political expression by unincorporated labor organizations was unconstitutional; (4) the statutory notices required incident to labor organizations' solicitation of political contributions from their membership were unconstitutional; and (5) the unequal statutory burden placed upon labor organizations' ability to solicit contributions from their members was an unconstitutional denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

As a result, the employee was disabled and unable to work for two months, after which he was reassigned to a pesticide free area.

The next day, the employee's skin condition recurred and he was placed on temporary total disability. Less than a year after the reassignment, the employee filed an action against the employer under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2745.01, which the employer claimed was untimely. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court held that the employee's action should not have been dismissed as untimely, since the complaint did not allege the exact date of the employer's tortious conduct and otherwise adequately stated a cause of action under &sect; 2745.01. The court also found that based upon the employee's affidavit alleging that the tort occurred when he was reassigned to handle pesticides his claim was filed timely.</SPAN></P>

The court held that pursuant to the mandatory language of Ohio Rev.

The court noted that the landowner filed a praecipe the day that the board of appeals filed its motion to dismiss, one day prior to the due date set by the trial court for the zoning board's brief and after the landowner's brief was due. The court agreed with the trial court's assessment that the 13th hour filing was untimely. Therefore, the court held that the landowner failed to comply with Ohio Rev.

Defendant plead no contest and was sentenced to one year in jail, a five year license suspension, and two years of probation. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion because the officer did not have probable cause to stop defendant's vehicle. The court held that the trial court did not err because the decision was supported by competent, credible evidence in the form of the officer's testimony. The court determined that defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were not abrogated by the traffic stop that resulted in his arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol and driving while under license suspension. The traffic stop was constitutionally permissible because the officer had probable cause to believe that defendant was in violation of Ohio Rev.

Defendant did not receive proper notice of the purpose of the hearing and refused a continuance because he did not want to delay his release from prison. The trial court adjudicated him to be a sexual predator, and on appeal the court reversed. Because defendant was not properly given notice in a timely fashion so that he could prepare for the hearing to determine whether he was to be classified as a sexual predator prior to his release from prison, the trial court was, thereafter, precluded from conducting a hearing to adjudicate defendant as a sexual predator. Because defendant was due to be released from prison within 24 hours from when he was brought before the trial court for his sexual predator hearing, there was no way for the trial court to both provide defendant with proper notice of the hearing and to conduct the hearing prior to defendant's release from prison.</SPAN></P>

The requirement of the local rule requiring the tenant to post a deposit within three days of learning of her trial date was reasonable and did not impair the tenant's constitutional right to a trial by jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty to involuntary manslaughter, with a firearm specification. The state entered a nolle prosequi to other counts and he was sentenced to 5 to 10 years of incarceration, to be served consecutively with three years of actual incarceration for the firearm specification. In affirming the dismissal of a post conviction petition, the court found that the guilty plea satisfied Ohio R. Crim. P. 11 requirements. Based on defendant's testimony at the plea hearing that he was not taking any medication, and that he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, the court found that a Health Information Transfer Summary was only marginally significant and did not advance his claim that his plea was involuntary beyond a mere hypothesis and a desire for further discovery. Furthermore, there was no indication that prescription medication interfered with his ability to make a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary plea. Defendant failed to sustain his initial burden of demonstrating sufficient operative facts to show substantive grounds for relief, and the court found no error prejudicial to his rights in the proceedings in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Code Ann. &sect; 2967.11, which provided for &quot;bad time.&quot; Defendant, however, had not alleged injury and that the record showed that defendant had not had his prison time extended pursuant to &sect; 2967.11. The court affirmed judgment determining defendant's terms of imprisonment and held that defendant lacked standing to have brought a constitutional challenge to &sect; 2967.11, therefore, his assignments of error were meritless. The court ruled that the constitutionality of a state statute may not have been brought into question by one who was not within the class against whom the operation of the statute was alleged to have been unconstitutionally applied and who had not been injured by its alleged unconstitutional provision. The court concluded that constitutional questions would not have been decided until the necessity for a decision arose on the record before the court. The court held that standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute required demonstration of concrete injury in fact, rather than an abstract or suspected injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State of Ohio appealed from the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which found that the sexual offender registration requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09 were unconstitutional as applied to defendant. Defendant cross-appealed the trial court's determination that he should be classified as a sexual predator, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01(E) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that applying the registration requirements of &sect; 2950.09 retroactively violated the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and the retroactivity clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's finding of unconstitutionality on the basis of prior opinions. The court affirmed the trial court's determination that, by clear and convincing evidence, defendant was a sexual predator. The court held that the trial court properly relied upon the young age of the victim and the fact that defendant had failed to complete a course of sex-offender counseling which was part of his shock probation. The court noted that recidivism was at the heart of the registration requirements, and noted the high rate of recidivism among sex offenders whose crimes involved the exploitation of young children. The court agreed with the trial court that defendant's failure to complete his counseling program evidenced a serious lack of commitment to avoid future offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, insofar as it determined defendant to be a sexual predator, but reversed the trial court's determination that the registration requirements were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The State sought review of the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which refused to cause a sexual predator finding to be included in defendant's institutional file and refused to attach its finding to defendant's judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of kidnapping, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2905.01(A)(4), defendant was adjudicated a sexual predator upon the State's recommendation. However, the trial court refused to cause the finding to be included in defendant's institutional file or to attach the finding to the judgment of conviction. The State contended that the trial court erred when it ruled that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.09(C) was unconstitutional as an &quot;ex post facto&quot; law and was an improper &quot;retroactive&quot; law as applied to defendant. The State also contended that the trial court erred in determining that prisoners constituted a &quot;suspect class&quot; for equal protection purposes. Defendant cross-appealed, alleging that &sect; 2950.09(C) was unconstitutionally vague and violated the Double Jeopardy and the Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2,10. The court sustained the State's assignments of error, holding that Ohio Rev.

The court found that &sect; 3599.12 imposed strict liability on violators because when a statute read, &quot;No person shall,&quot; absent any reference in the statute to the requisite culpable mental state, the statute was clearly indicative of a legislative intent to impose strict liability. There was sufficient evidence from which the trial court could conclude that defendant attempted to vote in a general election by impersonating or signing the name of another person. The trial court did not err in finding that defendant attempted to vote as his son because at no time did defendant indicate that he was acting under authority of a power of attorney.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual battery on two separate occasions and the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections recommended that he be classified as a sexual predator pursuant to &sect; 2950.09.

In a prior case, the court found that &sect; 2950.09 violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 on the retroactivity of laws. Defendant's sexual battery convictions occurred more than 10 years earlier. The sexual predator classification in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09 became effective nine years after defendant's last conviction.

The victim was the child of defendant's live-in girlfriend. The child was taken to the hospital by her mother for fever, stomach distention, and the inability to have a bowel movement. Physicians at the hospital concluded that the victim had been sexually abused. The court affirmed defendant's convictions because defendant's statement to a detective were properly admitted even though he did not receive Miranda warnings when defendant was not in custody. The test was whether a reasonable man in defendant's shoes would have understood that he was free to go. Sufficient evidence existed to support defendant's convictions because, pursuant to Ohio R. Evid. 29(a), the evidence was such that reasonable minds could have reached different conclusions as to whether each element of the crimes had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The court vacated the portion of the trial court's judgment that determined that defendant was a habitual sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed two of defendant's claims without an evidentiary hearing because there was no reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different, and held that the third claim failed to constitute sufficient operative facts to support a claim for postconviction relief on constitutional grounds. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Relying on Ohio R. App. P. 12(A), the court disregarded one of defendant's alleged errors because he failed to present reasons in support of his contentions and failed to brief the assignment of error, as required by Ohio R. App. P. 16(A). The court held that it was bound by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court and refused to adopt a different standard than that adopted by the Court in Brady for reviewing the State's obligation to turn over exculpatory evidence to the defense. The court determined that the trial court properly dismissed defendant's actual innocence claim because actual innocence was not a constitutional right and his claim failed to raise a denial or infringement of defendant's rights under the state or federal constitution, as required by Ohio Rev.

The court held: (1) Toledo, Ohio, City Charter &sect; 61 was incorporated into the collective bargaining agreement through Toledo, Ohio, Mun. Code &sect; 2125.94; thus, the municipal firefighter's claims arose from and were dependent upon the collective bargaining agreement; (2) as a contract provision entered into by means of collective bargaining, the residency requirement could not be characterized as positive law subject to a due process challenge for vagueness; (3) the municipal firefighter did not have a private cause of action against the City for alleged constitutional violations; and (4) the trial court correctly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the municipal firefighter's claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State leased a portion of it land to the tenant and sought to raise the annual rent for the property leased to the tenant based upon computations set forth in Ohio Admin.

The trial court agreed, and found for the tenant. The State sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held: (1) a declaratory judgment action is the appropriate vehicle for adjudicating the rights and relations of the parties to a contract; (2) the need for a speedy resolution may have been necessary in a challenge to an administrative rule or regulation, however, the principal thrust of the case was whether application of a regulation breached a contract, and whether the regulation was constitutional; (3) in making the contract, the State ceded away some of its authority and agreed to be bound to the terms of the lease; (4) the retroactive application of Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1501-6-06 to the lease was violative of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28; and (5) the State failed to show how the trial court's ruling was prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of one count of gross sexual imposition, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.05.

Code Ann. &sect; 2950.03(C), the county sheriff was to obtain defendant's name, identifying factors, expected future address, criminal history, photograph, and fingerprints. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held: (1) the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 did not constitute impermissible ex post facto laws and did not violate double jeopardy; (2) the protection of the public from sex offenders was a legitimate state interest; (3) the requirements of Ohio Rev.

The action was not a declaratory judgment action, and therefore, the court was without power to declare the registration provisions facially invalid with respect to all sexually oriented offenders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, defendants challenged an order of the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which adjudicated them sexual predators under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950. One defendant directly attacked the sufficiency of the evidence as to the sexual predator finding. The other defendants challenged the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were separately found guilty of sexual offenses and were sentenced. Subsequently, each defendant was adjudicated a sexual predator under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950. Defendants sought review. The court held that defendants were not denied procedural due process because &sect; 2950 provided them an opportunity to protect their liberty interest at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. The court held that the right to privacy in the damage to defendants' reputations was not a fundamental interest that triggered a higher standard of scrutiny. The court held that the protection of the public from sex offenses was a legitimate state interest, that the registration and notification requirements advanced the state interest, that there was reasonable grounds for differentiating between sexual predators and other offenders, and the that classification did not violate equal protection or due process rights. The court found that the statute on its face was nonpunitive, had a nonpunitive goal, the registration and notification requirements were not excessive, and that the statutory scheme did not advance retribution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the Ohio statute requiring the registration of sexual predators did not violate either the United States Constitution or the Ohio Constitution as applied to those who have been adjudicated sexual predators in a hearing after conviction of their respective crimes. The court affirmed the adjudications entered by the trial courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of menacing by stalking in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.11 as a result of his alleged conduct in following a doctor on several occasions over a nine-month period. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the statute was not unconstitutional. The statute's definition of &quot;pattern of conduct&quot; as being two or more actions or incidents was simple and easy to understand. Any alleged ambiguity was insufficient to render its meaning incomprehensible to persons of ordinary intelligence. The statute was not subject to a facial challenge on vagueness grounds on the basis that it chilled constitutionally protected conduct. It was not within the protection of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech to knowingly cause another to believe that one would cause physical harm or mental distress to him. The statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad, as the First Amendment did not protect the type of activity prohibited, nor did the statute criminalize a substantial amount of constitutionally protected activity.

The court held: (1) the state failed to file a motion seeking leave to appeal, therefore, there was no journalization of the appeal, and thus, no requisite final appealable order as to the State's issues; (2) the trial court's sentencing entry stated the law accurately in expressly finding that a prison term was not mandatory; (3) the trial court explained, as was required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.19(B)(2)(d), its reasons for imposing the maximum sentence; and (4) given the state of the record, the trial court's erroneous statement at law at the sentencing hearing was not prejudicial, and the trial court's sentencing &quot;worksheet&quot; indicated that the trial court found the more serious factors applicable, and the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court that entered judgment upon defendant's conviction on attempted rape charges, and affirmed the imposition of the maximum eight-year sentence. The trial court dismissed the State's appeal challenging the trial court's holding that the sexual predator laws were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment for appellee, and appellant sought review. The court found that it could not review the propriety of the trial court's decision concerning frivolous conduct and reasonableness of attorney fees in the absence of the necessary transcript, and it had to presume regularity in the proceedings below and affirm. The court held that the award of attorney fees under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2323.51 was not unconstitutional and contrary to the American Rule requiring each party to pay his or her own attorney fees because the frivolous conduct statute did not unreasonably restrict the openness of courts and the American Rule only applied in the absence of statutory authorization.

All statutes designed to promote the public health, safety, and welfare enjoyed a strong presumption of constitutionality. Defendant was being treated after the accident and a police officer was unable to obtain a blood sample for a BAC determination because he was being treated for his injuries. Appellant failed to prove that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.02(B)(2) was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.

The court found that appellants had not demonstrated that appellee police officers violated the knock-and-announce rule when they entered appellants' home to execute the search warrant. Appellants had not demonstrated that they were subjected to false imprisonment during the course of the search.

The members appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved two changes made by the Board with respect to retirement accounts. The Board decreased the interest rate applicable to retirement accounts and reduced the original baseline benefit payable to a member by the present value of the additional cost of living allowance (COLA) benefit. The members argued that the Board did not have authority to reduce their retirement benefits by charging them for the COLA, which the legislature mandated as an additional benefit for all of the System's plan members. The Board argued that it utilized its rule-making authority and promulgated Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3307-1-34, which authorizes the subtracting out the present value of the additional COLA benefit. The court reversed and held that the Board exceeded the authority in promulgating &sect; 3307-1-34.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3307.403 provided that all allowances, pensions, and benefits would be increased by the COLA benefit when the changes in the consumer price index meet certain criteria. The Board's attempt to give a member a choice of selecting a flat benefit that was not subject to the subsequent COLA increases was contrary to the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 331.34 was not in conflict with a general law on the same subject and therefore did not violate Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3.

The court rejected defendant's claim that only his prior record dealing with sexual offenses should have been considered by the trial court holding that all criminal records could be considered. Contrary to defendant's contention, a trial court did not need not find that a majority of the factors set forth in &sect; 2950.02(B)(2) applied to defendant before the trial court could determine that he was a sexual predator. The court noted that at the classification hearing, the trial court considered the presentence investigation record, the oral statements made by defendant's counsel and the prosecutor, and several factors set forth in &sect; 2950.09(B)(2), including the very tender age of the victim, defendant's extensive prior criminal record, the nature of the offense, and the cruelty of the offense; therefore, the determination that defendant was a sexual predator was supported by clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On a section of his property that was not farmable, the landowner set up a field to play paint ball. The landowner requested the zoning board that he be allowed to have a commercial paint ball field on his property.

The landowner unsuccessfully filed an appeal with the court of common pleas. On appeal, the court reversed the decision and remanded the case. The court found that the common pleas court improperly relied on upon evidence because the hearing was evidentiary and not a public hearing. Therefore, the court stated that any decision flowing from such a hearing must be based on the evidence presented and not public opinion. Because the record showed that all the evidence presented before the board was that of residents of the affected neighborhood, the court stated that there was not a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence supporting the decision of the court of common pleas.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also told the prisoner that after he had stabbed the victim and took his wallet, he was going to leave the house, but then decided to go back and cut the victim's throat to make sure that he was dead. When asked why he had killed the victim instead of just taking the money by force, defendant laughed and said that he had killed the victim because the victim had put up a fight. After reviewing the record, the court found that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that defendant was guilty of Aggravated Murder and Aggravated Robbery. Defendant's confession provided sufficient evidence for a trier of fact to conclude that defendant purposely killed the victim while committing a theft offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, cross-appellee city and cross-appellant water and sewer district sought review of judgments, upon cross-motions for summary judgment, by the Wood County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) that held the city pursuant to Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 4 could appropriate water mains and lines that were owned by the district, and the district could enforce any contracts or its rules and regulations within the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 4, which provided that any municipality could acquire the property of any company or person by condemnation or otherwise, authorized it to appropriate the district's water mains and lines that ran through the city. The court disagreed and reversed the judgment in that respect. The district was a political subdivision of the state pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 6119.04(A) and not a &quot;company or person&quot; as those terms were used in the constitutional provision, therefore the city could not appropriate its facilities. Similarly, the city's reliance upon several statutory provisions to support that argument also were without merit. The court affirmed the judgment that held the district pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 6119.06 had the right to operate it facilities within the city. Finally, the court also affirmed the holding that the district owned the water mains and lines even though the city. There were no statutory provisions that terminated the district's jurisdiction, and merely because the city's taxpayers paid for their construction through assessments, fees, and charges that did not give the city ownership.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the judgment that held the city could appropriate the water mains and lines that belonged to the district. The court affirmed the judgment that the district could enforce it rules and regulations in the city, that the city could operate it own water system within its boundaries, and that if the contract between the parties was terminated the city could disconnect it facilities from the district's lines.</SPAN></P>

The conviction was entered upon a jury verdict in the Madison County Municipal Court (Ohio) finding him guilty of operating a motor vehicle at a speed greater than 65 miles per hour on a freeway after having been convicted of the same offense on two prior occasions within one year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with speeding, and when he appeared in court he was informed that the complaint filed with the trial court enhanced his offense by alleging that he had two previous speed convictions within last 12 months for violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.21D2. Defendant did not receive a written copy of the amended charge, but demanded a jury trial, which he would not have been entitled to for a plain speeding charge. The court noted that the instrument did set forth the necessary allegation of additional elements to support a third degree misdemeanor charge as required Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.75(A). Therefore, the court found that the complaint was sufficient to charge defendant with a third degree misdemeanor. So long as a laser speed gun unit was operating properly, was used by qualified personnel, and was used in accordance with the operating instructions, its results were admissible without further expert testimony if the trial court chose to take judicial notice of a prior decision. As defendant failed to object to jury instructions, he was precluded from claiming error on appeal regarding the failure to instruct concerning judicial notice.</SPAN></P>

The other landowner, who raised cattle on his land, requested that appellant, who raised crops, replace or maintain the fence along the remaining one-half of the boundary line. When appellant did not maintain the remaining half of the fence, the other landowner complained to the trustees pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 971.04 that appellant neglected to maintain one-half of the fence. The trustees directed appellant to construct one-half of the fence. The trial court concluded that appellant failed to prove that his cost of complying with the trustees' order exceeded the difference between the value of his land before and after the repair or replacement of the fence. On appeal, the court overruled appellant's assignments of error. Appellant cited no authority requiring an equal apportionment of the costs resulting from a partition fence line decision. The court found that appellant had ceased to maintain his half of the fence; consequently, an equal distribution of repairing or replacing the entire fence would reward appellant for his lack of maintenance and penalize the other landowner for his maintenance of the fence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seven defendants were informed at sentencing that the parole board could increase their respective prison sentences up to 50 percent if they could commit a crime in prison, under Ohio Rev.

The record showed that not one of the seven defendants had their prison time extended pursuant to &sect; 2967.11. Constitutional questions could not be decided until the necessity for a decision arises on the record before the court. Standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute required demonstration of concrete injury in fact, rather than an abstract or suspected injury.

The original judgment entry of sentencing was filed on March 21, 1994, but was then corrected on June 27, 1994, in a judgment entry nunc pro tunc, with respect to the specifications. Defendant argued on appeal that he should be resentenced pursuant to Amend. Sub. S.B. No. 2 and that it was unconstitutional not to do so; that is, he desired to be sentenced under newly enacted sentencing guidelines instead of those in effect at the time of his offenses. The court affirmed the order that denied relief to defendant and held that the newly enacted sentencing laws could not be retroactively applied because the legislature specifically stated they were not retroactive. The Supreme Court of Ohio had ruled that the nonretroactive provisions did not violate constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. Defendant was properly sentenced pursuant to the guidelines that existed at the time of his offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attempted to push between an officer and two of defendant's friends while the officer was issuing citations to the friends for open container violations. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss, as defendant did not argue that the face of the complaints against him were invalid. The trial court would have had to rely upon the testimony adduced at the motion hearing in order to determine whether the police had probable cause to arrest defendant. Moreover, a lack of probable cause to arrest would not have provided a basis for a judgment of acquittal, nor would it require the State to dismiss its case. Defendants' actions did amount to criminal conduct. The evidence was sufficient to establish not only that the police possessed probable cause to arrest defendant for obstructing official business, but also to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court's findings of fact were supported by substantial competent, credible evidence. The trial court did not misapply &sect; 2921.31(A) to the facts, as defendant could violate the statute without being successful in preventing the officer from doing his job.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court dismissed the petition, review was sought. Upon review, the court rejected the contention that the trial court had erred in dismissing several claims on res judicata grounds because the claims had been raised or could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal. The court also held counsel had not been ineffective in failing to raise a mistake defense to the offense of having weapons while under disability because the prisoner's mistake of law was an invalid defense. Moreover, the court held it had not been plain error for the trial court to dismiss the petition based upon the prisoner's untimely filing under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.23(A). The court held an exception to the timely filing requirement had not been demonstrated because: (1) the United States Supreme Court had not recognized a new federal or state right that applied retroactively; and (2) the prisoner had not been prevented from discovering facts upon which a claim for relief depended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant disputed his conviction on the grounds that: (1) the trial court erred in overruling defendant's motion to suppress because the State did not prove defendant's statements were given voluntarily; and (2) the trial court erred in overruling defendant's motion to dismiss or declare unconstitutional the sentencing statute's &quot;bad time&quot; provision under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.11. In affirming, the court held that the totality of the circumstances indicated that defendant had not been coerced into accepting responsibility for the marijuana and thus defendant's statements at his house were made knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently. The court further refused to entertain defendant's challenge to the &quot;bad time&quot; provision of &sect; 2967.11 because it had not yet directly affected him when he filed his motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) that convicted him of the crimes of felonious sexual penetration, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.12(A)(1)(b), (A)(2), and gross sexual imposition, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.05(A)(4), with a specification of causing the victim to submit with force or the threat of force.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to trial, defendant requested funds to employ a psychologist as an expert witness and moved for the appointment of a medical expert. Both motions were overruled. The alleged victim was defendant's young daughter. After the five-day jury trial ended in conviction, defendant was sentenced to a determinate period of life in prison. On appeal, defendant raised eight assignments of error. Although the court acknowledged that defendant's motion for expert assistance was inartfully articulated, the court determined that the motion provided the trial court with reasonable notice that defendant needed expert assistance to prepare his defense. The court held that the trial court abused its discretion and reversed the judgment. Although his motion for a medical expert was filed just four days before trial, the court ruled that the appointment of a medical expert was required to assure defendant's right to a fair trial in a child abuse case involving a potential penalty of life imprisonment. Expert assistance was reasonably necessary to provide defendant with an adequate defense. The court ruled that defendant's other assignments of error had no merit.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied her motion to withdraw her guilty plea, finding that defendant was aware there could be deportation consequences. The court reversed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyers filed and action against the sellers for damages arising from a breach of the covenant of warranty. The trial court granted a summary judgment in favor of the sellers. On appeal, the buyers contended that the trial court erred in ruling that they could not recover damages for improvements made to the property and in granting summary judgment because they presented evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the sellers made fraudulent misrepresentations regarding their ownership of the property. The sellers argued that the buyers' recovery was limited to the purchase price of the contract, absent fraud. The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of the sellers. The court held that the measure of damages for breach of the covenant of warranty was the purchase price plus interest. Additionally, the court held that the buyers failed to properly assert a cause of action for fraud, because their pleadings did meet the requirements of Ohio R. Civ. P. 9(B). To properly assert a cause of action for fraud, a party must plead the circumstances constituting fraud with particularity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from a trial court (Ohio), which convicted defendant of Gross Sexual Imposition, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.05, after defendant entered a negotiated plea of guilty. The trial court also suspended defendant's term of imprisonment and placed defendant on probation, but ordered defendant to register as a sexual offender, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.04(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court was not authorized by &sect; 2950.04 to require him to register, notwithstanding the fact that he was convicted of a sexually oriented offense. On the other hand, defendant argued that if the trial court was authorized to require him to register, &sect; 2950.04 was, as applied to him, an unconstitutional ex post facto or retroactive law. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment imposing the registration requirement. As a result, the court modified defendant's sentence to remove the requirement. Specifically, the court interpreted &sect; 2950.04 and held that because defendant's sexually oriented offense was not one to which the registration requirement applied, the trial court erred when it ordered defendant to register pursuant to that section. Additionally, the court found that because the requirements of that section were not in effect when defendant's sentence was journalized, the trial court was not then authorized to impose a registration requirement. Accordingly, due to the court's holding that &sect; 2950.04 had no application to the case, the court noted that it did not need to address defendant's alternative constitutional arguments.</SPAN></P>

The court vacated defendant's conviction and instructed the trial court to conduct an in camera review of the victim's grand jury testimony. It found although defendant had not demonstrated a particularized need to inspect the grand jury testimony, the potential inconsistencies between the victim's grand jury testimony and her trial testimony were more than mere speculation and, as her testimony was the essence of the case, the discrepancies in the dates between the victim's trial testimony and those listed in the indictment created a probability that failure to disclose the grand jury testimony could deprive defendant of a fair adjudication.

Code &sect; 2953.21. Appellant pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter, an aggravated felony of the first degree, with a firearm specification and was sentenced by the trial court. No direct appeal was taken from the conviction or the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant set forth as his constitutional claim that the amended sentencing provisions of Am. Sub. S.B. 2 (1996), which were prospective in operation, deprived him of his right to equal protection and due process. The trial court denied his petition. On appeal, appellant argued that his sentence was disproportionate to the sentences being imposed on similarly situated offenders, denying him equal protection. The court disagreed. The Ohio Supreme Court had stated that the refusal of the General Assembly to retroactively apply the differing provisions of Am. Sub. S.B. 2 (1996) to persons convicted and sentenced before July 1, 1996 did not violate their equal protection and due process rights. Distinguishing between defendants convicted before July 1, 1996 and those convicted after that date furthered the legitimate state interest of judicial economy by not requiring trial courts to re-sentence defendants. The court held that defendant's sentence did not violate the uniformity of laws mandate of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26. That provision did not forbid statutes and statutory changes to have a beginning, and thus to discriminate between the rights of an earlier and later time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after he responded to a police informant's page by driving to a parking lot and selling drugs to the informant in a controlled drug buy.

He appeared pro se and filed discovery requests and other motions, and standby counsel was appointed. On review, the court found that he did not demonstrate he made a motion for new counsel or that there was ineffective assistance. The court found that pursuant to Ohio R. Crim.

The court reversed in part and found that the State did not prove that he possessed 25 &quot;unit doses&quot; of crack as defined in Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen group contended that the lower court erred in finding that the initiative ordinances were void and that the opinions of the Ohio Ethics Commission did not have sufficient force to override the municipality's authority to enact ordinances that increased the compensation of elected officials. The court rejected the contentions of the citizen group, finding that the initiative ordinances violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 731.07 because the statute prohibited any change to the salary of an officer during the term for which the officer was elected. The court noted that the council acted within its power in enacting ordinances that increased compensation of elected officials. The court ruled that references to the advisory opinions were misplaced because the proper forum for challenging the propriety of the ordinances that increased the compensation of the officials was by filing a complaint with the Ohio Ethics Commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank customer brought an action against appellees, a hospital, the hospital's counsel, and a bank, alleging that they wrongfully attached funds that the bank customer placed in two joint and survivorship accounts that he shared with his wife. The Athens County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) granted judgment denying the bank customer's motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank customer alleged that the trial court erred in holding that the bank had no duty to determine the joint tenant's share of a joint account; in holding that the bank had no duty to determine &quot;personal earnings&quot; in an account prior to garnishment of a joint account; in holding that the bank was not responsible for notifying the bank customer of the garnishment; and in granting a motion for summary judgment for the hospital where the hospital trespassed upon the account of an innocent third party. The court held that the bank protection statutes protected banks from liability with respect to orders of payment from joint accounts and that banks had no duty to determine the ownership proportions in a joint account or what funds came from personal earnings. No authority supported the position that a non-debtor was entitled to notice of a garnishment of a joint account. The documentary evidence submitted failed to raise a genuine issue of fact. When garnishing the bank customer's accounts, the bank and the hospital were engaging in usual and customary credit collection procedures authorized by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant beat the victim, thereby causing the victim's pregnancy to terminate. Thereafter, defendant was convicted of manslaughter for unlawfully terminating a pregnancy. Accordingly, defendant sought review, claiming that the bill proscribing the unlawful termination of a pregnancy was unconstitutional. In light of defendant's failure to establish that no set of circumstances existed under which the bill would be valid, the court rejected a facial challenge to the overbreadth of the bill because the bill was constitutional in some of its applications. The court also rejected defendant's substantive due process claim because defendant, as a third-party, did not have a fundamental liberty interest in terminating another's pregnancy. In rejecting this claim, the court held that while a woman had a fundamental right to terminate a pregnancy, that right did not translate into a third-person's fundamental right to use violent conduct to deprive a pregnant woman of the woman's choice.Finally, the court held that the crime's sentence did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment because the sentence was proportional to the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Butler County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which adjudicated him a &quot;sexual predator&quot; pursuant to Am. Sub. H.B. 180, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 1996), partially codified at Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950. The adjudication had been in connection with defendant's scheduled release after serving his sentence on a conviction for four counts of gross sexual imposition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was defendant's contention that because his classification as a sexual predator was triggered by convictions that predated the statute, the law violated the Ex Post Facto Clause and retroactive clause of the Ohio Constitution. The court disagreed, holding that the sexual predator classification and attendant registration, address verification, and community notification requirements contained in the law violated neither constitutional provision. The court found that the Ohio General Assembly unequivocally expressed its intention to have the sexual predator law apply retroactively in numerous provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950. The court further found that the possible effects of the notification and registration provisions were not so punitive in fact that the law could not be viewed as regulatory and non-punitive in nature. Thus, because the classification scheme and attendant registration, verification, and notification provisions were not punitive, but rather a de minimus administrative requirement with a wholly remedial purpose, defendant's classification as a sexual predator under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C) did not violate the constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sentenced defendant to a five-year prison term for sexual battery, and a one-year term for each of three tampering with records charges, with each sentence to run consecutively. Defendant claimed that his adjudication as a sexual predator under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution, and Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. He contended that the sexual predator law and attendant registration, verification, and notification requirements were retroactive laws in violation of the Ohio Constitution because the sexual predator law became effective after his indictment but prior to the date he was sentenced. Defendant also contended that he was not notified of the hearing and he was denied effective assistance of counsel. On review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court upheld the sexual predator law as constitutional, but it found that proper notice was not given, so defendant was entitled to a new hearing on the sexual predator status. Sentencing to consecutive terms was permissible, and the effective assistance argument was moot due to resolution of the notice issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions and upheld the sexual predator law, but it reversed the finding that defendant was a sexual predator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant motor home owner appealed from the Bowling Green Municipal Court (Ohio), which found the owner guilty of violating Middleton Township, Ohio, Zoning Res. art. XVII, &sect; 8, an ordinance of appellee township that prohibited parking unlicensed vehicles for more than 90 days unless they were in a garage or accessory building.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner asserted that the zoning resolution was unconstitutional on several grounds, that it was an invalid exercise of the police power, and that it was not authorized by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;519.02. The court on appeal noted that the record was without a transcript and stated that, absent the portions of the transcript necessary to determine whether the ordinance was constitutional as applied to the owner, it had no choice but to presume the validity of the municipal court's proceedings and could only consider whether the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face. The court held that the ordinance was presumed to be valid and that the burden was on the owner to rebut that presumption. The court found that similar ordinances prohibiting or regulating the outside storage of motor homes in residential areas had survived constitutional challenges and were a proper exercise of the police power for the general welfare of the community where such storage could become a nuisance or interfere with the character and integrity of the community. Because the owner had presented no evidence to overcome the presumption of validity, the court upheld the decision of the municipal court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest to a charge of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol. The trial court vacated the administrative license suspension, but did not vacate the $ 250 reinstatement fee which, if not paid, operated to continue the administrative license suspension. The trial court overruled defendant's motion to waive the reinstatement fee applicable to the administrative license suspension. The court reversed because the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented the State from charging two reinstatement fees arising out of the single criminal conduct. The court held that criminal court were to terminate the administrative license suspension at the time of criminal sentencing because continued recognition of the suspension was unconstitutional, and the failure to vacate the reinstatement fee was a tacit recognition of the suspension in violation of the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had granted summary judgment to the administratrix and found the claim barred because it was not presented within one year after the decedent's death. On appeal, the court first noted that the time within which claims were to be presented, as provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2117.06(B), was mandatory.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty to five charges of gross sexual imposition involving children ranging from seven to 11 years of age. The trial court overruled appellant's motion that it find &sect; 2950.09(B)&nbsp;unconstitutional as an ex post facto law. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred by overruling his motion for an order finding &sect; 2950.09(B) inapplicable as an ex post facto law and thereafter finding defendant a sexual predator contra to the United States and Ohio constitutions. Defendant contended that he should have been sentenced in accordance with the law in effect at the time the offenses were committed. The court held that the ex post facto prohibition did not prevent the General Assembly from referring to evidence in the past in order to provide comprehensive regulation of the present. Such laws regulated a present situation and were remedial; they did not punish for the prior conviction. The court determined that the registration and notification requirement did not amount to a form of punishment. Therefore, defendant's ex post facto challenge failed under the punishment part of the analysis.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, she claimed that the trial court erroneously denied her motion to suppress the evidence seized in the matter, or in the alternative, have the case against her dismissed. The court disagreed, holding that the reported assault at the tavern gave the officer a reasonable suspicion of a violation of the liquor control laws, which provided for a warrantless administrative search of the premises. The court further held that because defendant's employer had been licensed to sell beer or intoxicating liquor, it subjected itself to the Liquor Control Act and therefore had no expectation of privacy in its premises. The court also held that the tavern had waived the protection of the Ohio and U.S. Constitutions in regards to search and seizures, so the police officer's warrantless search of the premises was not illegal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's petition for post-conviction relief, together with the requisite number of copies required by local practice, was time-stamped in the clerk's office one day after the one-year deadline imposed under Am. Sub. S.B. 4, &sect; 3 (Ohio). Relying on the summary of the docket and journal entries, which reflected an earlier filing that was not time-stamped, defendant argued that his petition was timely. He also argued that the limitation imposed by &sect; 3 was an unconstitutional ex post facto law. The state contended that the earlier filing was properly rejected because it lacked the proper number of copies. The court reversed the dismissal of defendant's petition and remanded the case for a determination whether the earlier petition was in fact filed before the deadline. No statute or properly adopted rule of court specified the number of copies to be filed with a petition for post-conviction relief, and dismissal for violation of a local rule would be inappropriate. Section 3 was not an ex post facto law where it did not punish as criminal conduct that was innocent when performed, or increase the punishment for a crime after its commission, or deprive an accused of any defense.</SPAN></P>

Defendant plead guilty to 15 counts in exchange for the State's agreement not to pursue additional charges. The trial judge refused to sentenced defendant to an aggregate term of 30 to 40 years. However, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01(G) referred to convictions entered prior to a specified date, and defendant's plea was taken after that date. The State appealed to have defendant designated as a sexual predator. The court reversed the sentence. Defendant appeared in court before the date specified in the statute. He entered guilty pleas to 15 sexually oriented offenses that occurred prior to that date. Although he was sentenced after that date, defendant committed and pled to the offenses prior to the specified date and should have been classified as a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>

Defendant further argued that the trial court incorrectly found that defendant's waiver of his right to a jury trial was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. However, the court held that no objection was entered regarding the procedure by which defendant waived his right to a jury, and therefore, he was restricted to arguing on appeal that the trial court committed plain error by accepting his jury waiver. Further, the court held that the aggravating circumstances that defendant was found guilty of committing outweighed the mitigating factors, that defendant's death sentence was appropriate, and that his sentence was not disproportionate in relation to other cases in which the death penalty was imposed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations brought an action against appellees that challenged the constitutionality of legislation that created JEDDs. The trial court granted appellees' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On appeal, the court affirmed. Under the Ohio Constitution the legislature could authorize the creation of a JEDD as well its board. Although appellants asserted that the State could not delegate the power to impose an income tax to a township, the court noted that the taxing power was delegated to the JEDD board, not to the township. The constitution was primarily a limitation on legislative power; thus the Ohio General Assembly could pass the legislation because it was not specifically prohibited by the constitution. Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26, which required uniform operation of laws, was not violated because a JEDD could exist in all counties in Ohio. No equal protection or due process violation was established because taxing the income of employees and businesses in the district who would enjoy the benefits of those services and improvements was a means rationally related to the JEDD's purpose: to make townships more attractive to prospective businesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the stipulation of facts was sufficient evidence, as a matter of law, to support the trial court's determination that defendant was a sexual predator because there was an inference that there was a compulsion, given that contact occurred three times over a period of time. Thus, there was clear and convincing evidence that defendant was a sexual predator. Defendant contended that application of Ohio Rev. Code 2950.08 violated U.S. Const. art. &sect; 10 ex-post facto laws and Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, which prohibited retroactive laws. The offense was committed prior to enactment of the sexual predator provision, but sentencing occurred after it became law. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.09 was not a retroactive law because it did not impose new duties and obligations upon the defendant's past conduct and transaction. Thus, it did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 provision that prohibited the legislature from passing retroactive laws. The law was not punitive in its classification, registration, or community notification requirements.

The cause was continued by the trial court due to the trial court's involvement in a criminal trial on the initial trial date. Defendants filed a motion for continuance of the new trial date on the basis that the new trial date was the first full day of Passover and defendants were Jewish. The trial court denied the motion and entered a judgment for the bank when defendants failed to appear at trial. The court reversed the trial court's decision. There was no evidence that defendants requested a continuance for purposes of delay. The trial court should have considered the length of the delay requested, whether other continuances had been requested, the inconvenience to litigants, and whether the requested delay was for legitimate reasons. Defendants had not previously requested other continuances. The bank did not oppose the continuance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a decision by the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted defendant's motion to suppress a concealed weapon recovered after defendant's arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped defendant's car because the rear license plate was not illuminated. The officer detained defendant when he failed to produce a driver's license. After defendant was placed in the officer's vehicle, the officer heard a shot that was fired by defendant from a concealed weapon. The weapon was later recovered. At trial on the State's charges of carrying a concealed weapon and assaulting a police officer, defendant filed a motion to suppress the weapon. The trial court granted the motion and the State sought review. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that once the police officer observed that defendant's car bore a temporary license tag in a proper place, he was not justified in detaining defendant. At that point, the court said, the stop was unconstitutional and any evidence seized in a search of the vehicle was inadmissible. However, the court said, the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine did not preclude admission of the evidence on the assault charge. No exploitation of the prior illegality was present in such a case, the court said, and the rationale of the exclusionary rule did not justify its extension to such an extreme.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained a ruling that suppressed a concealed weapon recovered after defendant's arrest but held that evidence was admissible to show that the weapon was used to assault a police officer after defendant's arrest. The court remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder for his part in the kidnapping, rape, and beating death of a victim. Defendant contended that the trial court violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection of the law when it denied his petition without holding an evidentiary hearing.

The court noted that under Ohio Rev.

Because all of defendant's claims were raised and denied on his direct appeal and were barred by res judicata, the court concluded that the trial court was not required to hold a hearing under &sect; 2953.21(C) when no substantive grounds for relief existed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that that defendant was afforded proper notice and an opportunity to be heard. Moreover, the court held that defendant was afforded his right to call, and did call, witnesses on his own behalf. Therefore, the court held that there was no violation of defendant's rights to due process and equal protection. The court also held that driving was a privilege in Ohio, not a right and therefore, the state could regulate the exercise of that privilege with laws, such as requiring all drivers to maintain a valid driver's license. Therefore, the court held that defendant did not establish that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4507.02 violated his right to the free exercise of religion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother engaged in a sexual relationship with the father and became pregnant. The mother's husband signed the child's birth certificate. The natural father filed a parentage action pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.04, which was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. A subsequent parentage action was filed, and genetic testing was conducted. The results excluded the husband and indicated that the father was the child's father. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment that ratified the magistrate's decision, which granted appellees' motion to dismiss on public policy grounds. The court held that &sect; 3111.04 was not unconstitutional and that the dismissal of the action was an abuse of discretion. Because genetic tests were admissible to overcome the presumption of paternity contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.03(A)(1), the trial court should have considered the test results before ruling on appellees' motion. The court held that the trial court had no power to nullify a statute upon the ground that it was against public policy.

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in sentencing him to consecutive prison terms for rape and kidnapping under Ohio's multiple-counts statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25. The court agreed, reversed the convictions, and remanded for resentencing in the first action. In doing so, the court held that the trial court erred in convicting and sentencing defendant for both kidnapping and rape because the restraint, confinement, and the movement of the victim were insufficient to support separate convictions. In the second action, the appeal was dismissed as premature due to the trial court's failure to comply with the sexual predator statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(3).</SPAN></P>

During negotiations with one officer, other officers shot and killed the juvenile when he allegedly took aim at the negotiating officer. The trial court granted summary judgment and the court affirmed on the only claim before it, the alleged violation of &sect; 1983. First, the prerequisites to liability for a supervising officer were not established because there was no evidence that he had any direct involvement in what transpired. Second, the officers on the scene had qualified immunity because the administratrix presented no evidence that they violated any clearly established law. The court determined that the officers had not used excessive force because their actions were reasonable under the circumstances. There was a significant threat of death or serious physical harm to the negotiator when the juvenile took aim at him, and the officers who fired only had a split-second in which to make their decision to shoot. The administratrix's evidence as to other alternative courses of action or procedures was hindsight and was not sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment asserting the defense of qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Common Pleas of Auglaize County (Ohio) granted summary judgment in favor of defendant, citing res judicata. A suit concerning the accident had been brought earlier in federal court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children had brought suit in federal court for negligence, products liability, and breach of warranty. Summary judgment was granted the manufacturer. The children claimed that when their federal complaint was filed, an applicable statute of repose precluded a meritorious claim of vicarious liability from being presented against the manufacturer for the actions of the installer. Since that time, the statute of repose was found unconstitutional. The court pointed out that the children once again attempted to designate this particular party as liable for the death of the their fathers. The facts and events were the same as those in the federal suit. The court emphasized that the same transaction or occurrence was at issue. The court explained that permitting re-litigation after a change in the law would have undermined the stability of final judgments. The court added that the law which was altered had no bearing on the children's ability to raise the vicarious liability claim. The change affected only their chances of success on the claim. Accordingly, the court concluded that the claim could have been properly raised in the first suit and not to do so was a tactical decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city housing division ordered the owner to repair her rental structure by serving her with notices to comply, pursuant to Akron, Ohio, Environmental Housing Code &sect; 150.03. Thereafter, the housing division determined that the property should be condemned. The owner appealed to the board. The owner was unable to attend the board hearing, but the continuance request of the owner's son was denied. The board upheld the housing division's order. The trial court affirmed the board's decision and order. The court held that the board's refusal to grant the son's continuance infringed upon the owner's right to be heard. However, by granting the owner's motion for an evidentiary hearing, the trial court adhered to the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.04 remedy for such an infringement. Thus, the trial court acted properly in conducting the hearing and in refusing to remand the case for an evidentiary hearing. The trial court did not err in determining that the board's condemnation and demolition orders were supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. Finally, the scope of the cross-examination of a housing inspector was permissible under Ohio R. Evid. 611(B).</SPAN></P>

Defendants maintained that the employment action was due to his unsatisfactory performance and his untimely production of medical documentation to support his extended leave for a physical ailment. The trial court granted defendants' motion for a directed verdict as to all of the officer's various claims. On appeal the court ruled that a directed verdict was appropriate on the: (1) claim that the action breached the collective bargaining agreement executed by the police department because the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claim; (2) &sect; 1983 claim because there was no deprivation of any federal constitutional right; (3) &sect; 1985 claim because there was no evidence of a conspiracy; (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress claim because he did not prove the prima facie elements of the claim; (5) civil coercion or obstruction of official business claims because such causes of action did not exist, and; (6) whistleblower claim because there no evidence of retaliation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's postconviction petition alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective. The court stated that all the ineffective-assistance claims that defendant asserted in his postconviction petition could have been brought on direct appeal. If defendant's trial attorney did not properly perform at the mitigation phase because he did not interview witnesses, defendant could have brought the argument on direct appeal. The court noted that defendant had no right to a &quot;rapport&quot; with his trial attorney. The court found that the trial court did not rule on defendant's motion for discovery. But the trial court's denial of the postconviction petition implicitly denied his request for discovery. Defendant raised the issue on direct appeal that the trial court erred in denying his postconviction petition because the death penalty was unconstitutional. Thus, this issue was res judicata. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying him postconviction relief because Ohio's proportionality review of death-penalty sentences was unconstitutional. The court commented that the supreme court continued to rely on the proportionality review required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.05(A).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lived on a farm and raised exotic and domestic birds as his primary source of income. To combat the threat from great horned owls preying on his birds, defendant erected pole, or leg hold traps, at various locations where his birds were located. He was charged, and eventually convicted, of violating &sect; 1533.07 after an inspector from the Ohio Division of Wildlife spotted the traps during a routine inspection. The State contended that defendant was attempting to take or kill an owl at a time when damage to his property was not occurring, while defendant contended that waiting until an owl had actually caught one of his birds in his beak would be too late to forestall damage to his property. The court found that the statute as interpreted by the trial court in the instructions given to the jury unconstitutionally abridged defendant's right to protect his property. In reversing, the court instructed that upon remand, the statute should be construed more broadly to allow a property owner to use such force as was reasonably necessary to protect his property from the predatory owls.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed suit against the employer and alleged that the employer was responsible for personal injuries that he sustained in the course of his employment. The complaint contained allegations under common law and statutory law that the employer intentionally caused employee's injuries and that the employer was liable under the dual capacity doctrine of products' liability. The trial court granted the employer's motion to dismiss under Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2745.01 was constitutional. The employee appealed and the court affirmed the judgment in part and reversed it in part. The court held that the provision setting forth what constituted an &quot;employment intentional tort&quot; under &sect; 2745.01 was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection clause of the Ohio Constitution. Construing the facts in a light most favorable to the employee, the complaint sufficiently set forth an intentional tort claim. Thus, the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint on this claim. However, the complaint did not set forth a claim upon which relief could be granted for product's liability. Thus, that claim was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02 and was sentenced. Defendant filed a motion for post-conviction relief, arguing that the General Assembly's passage of Am. Sub. S.B. 2, Gen. Assemb. (Ohio) effectively repealed the statutes under which defendant was sentenced and that because the amended statutes imposed lesser penalties for identical conduct, they were a remedial law which the trial court had a duty to apply retroactively. Defendant also argued that his continued imprisonment under the former statutes violated his constitutional rights. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in finding that the failure to apply the statute retroactively violated his constitutional rights. The court affirmed, concluding that: (1) the change in law reflected by Am. Sub. S.B. 2, Gen. Assemb. (Ohio) occurred long after defendant's case had been through the appellate process and had reached final judgment; and (2) Am. Sub. S.B. 2 created a different sentencing scheme for those who commit crimes after July 1, 1996.</SPAN></P>

Appellant had argued that appellees' action was a taking of his property without just compensation and a denial of due process under both the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner has brought an action that alleged appellee city and mayor's action was a taking of his property without just compensation in violation of federal and state constitutional rights. The action arose from damage done to appellant's property by the police while they executed a search warrant. The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the judgment was reversed and the cause was remanded. The court found that appellant's claims brought under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 were properly dismissed because appellant failed to offer any proof that appellee has an official policy, custom, or practice regarding the conduct of police officers while executing a search warrant. However, the court found that appellant has set forth genuine issues of material fact as to his state constitutional claim of a taking of his property without just compensation as required by Ohio Const. art.

The court had found that damage caused by police actions led to the property's condemnation, appellant was not financially able to pay for the repairs which would correct the violations, and appellant effectively has been denied access to his property by appellee.</SPAN></P>

In July 1997, the State Department of Rehabilitation and Correction recommended to the court of common pleas that defendant be adjudicated a sexual predator and subject to the community notification requirements set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950. The trial judge found defendant to be a sexual predator as defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01(E). However, the judge also determined that the newly enacted mandates of Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2950 were unconstitutional as applied to defendant since the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution and the Retroactive Clause of the Ohio Constitution were violated. Notwithstanding that finding, defendant was ordered to register as a sexual offender, pursuant to &sect; 2950.04, upon his release from prison.

Defendant's motion for post-conviction relief was based on his claim that his sentence had been rendered unconstitutional and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court's order denying defendant's motion for post-conviction relief was upheld on appeal. The court found that defendant's motion was untimely under Ohio Rev.

Defendant shouted to her brother to back the car up so that they could shoot their victims. One person died as a result of shots fired. All three defendants were captured and tried. A mistrial was called after it was discovered that one of the jurors received a telephone call from the jail. Defendant was given a new trial. The jury found her guilty of murder and felonious assault, both with firearms specifications. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that defendant's alleged statements to her brother were sufficient for the jury to have found that, if she did not commit the principal offense, she at least aided and abetted its commission. The court found that the fact that jury instructions were given for the offence of complicity was not error when defendant was not indicted for such offense.

The statute specifically identified four types of similar behavior that would not be tolerated, establishing a standard of conduct prohibited through telephonic means. Defendant argued that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court found the evidence was sufficient. Defendant had spoken vehemently about his personal opposition to the victim's candidacy in public. The telephone call occurred a few days after the victim's father was buried. Defendant knew that the victim was likely to be depressed. Defendant knew of their political animosity.

App. P. 26 and to argue that he was denied the effective assistance of appellate counsel, as well as a trial counsel. In overruling defendant's arguments, the court held that his trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to the sentencing judgment entry as the absence of the record and the principle that courts could only speak through their journals demonstrated the lack of an issue to which counsel could have objected. Nor was counsel ineffective in advising defendant to accept sentencing under a statute providing an indeterminate sentence, as defendant had signed a notice that advised him of the differences between the previous statute and the one then applicable. Further, defendant's prior theft conviction resulted in his subjection to sentencing under the recidivist statute, which did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Thus, defendant failed to demonstrate that error occurred at the trial level and the court was compelled to conclude that his appellate counsel did not render ineffective assistance in failing to present the errors in the original appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the conviction and sentence on grounds that the trial court misinterpreted the effective dates of Ohio's criminal sentencing statutes. On review, the court affirmed, holding that sentence was proper because the classification of those who committed a crime before an effective date of an amended sentencing laws and those who committed the same crime after the effective date of the amending sentencing laws was not in violation of equal protection.

None of the claims of trial counsel's tactics was sufficient to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel. Legislation enacted after her conviction and sentence did not operate as an ex post facto law as it did not change her status as a prisoner or her situation. While her claim that the legislation had changed the status of other convicted felons, but not changed her status, may have given rise to a claim of unfairness or disproportionality, she could not maintain the position that a law which did not change her status was ex post facto. Petitioner's sentence was not disproportionate and the claim that she was worse off under the new legislation was speculative, and contradicted her claim of disproportionality. Three years was the minimum sentence for a felony one under the new legislation, but a determinate sentence of four, five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten years might have also been imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were divorced, and the husband appealed several of the trial court's judgments. The court held that even if the wife gave false information in her affidavit in support of her motion for temporary custody, the trial court did not lose jurisdiction. The trial court properly overruled the husband's motion for a more definite statement with respect to the wife's complaint, which alleged sufficient facts to put the husband on notice of the issues. The trial court properly denied the husband visitation because he had been convicted of child endangering. The trial court also properly refused to dismiss the wife's complaint for failure to comply with a discovery order. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3105.01(H), which provided that imprisonment was a ground for divorce, was constitutional. There was sufficient evidence for granting a divorce on the grounds of living separate and apart. The trial court correctly treated the husband's civil action against the wife as a counterclaim in the divorce action because it dealt with marital debts. However, the trial court's judgment in ordering the husband not to file any more visitation motions was overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court's judgment that ordered the husband not to file any more visitation motions and remanded the case with instructions to draft the order regarding visitation motions more narrowly.

The trial court issued a decision that granted the state's motion for judgment, denied defendant's motion for partial summary judgment, and dismissed his petition for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of setting a fire in his home while his wife, two sons, and two daughters were inside. One son died. Defendant was convicted of two counts of aggravated murder with death penalty specifications, four counts of attempted aggravated murder, six counts of aggravated arson, and one count of aggravated theft. Defendant exhausted his direct appeals, then filed a petition that sought postconviction relief in the trial court. The trial court found that 34 of defendant's 38 claims were or could have been raised on appeal, and that defendant did not allege sufficient facts on the other claims. The trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment without an evidentiary hearing. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court agreed that res judicata barred all of the claims the trial court identified, and found that three of the remaining four claims could also have been raised on appeal and were barred. In the remaining claim defendant failed to sustain his initial burden of demonstrating sufficient operative facts to show substantive grounds for relief. This evidence must have been genuinely significant and materially advanced the claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was incarcerated at a state correctional facility. The inmate filed a complaint against the director and alleged that the facility's employees violated the inmate's constitutional rights by denying him his commissary privileges, deprived him access to the courts, violated his due process rights through the enforcement of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2969.21 through 2969.27 without prior notice, and inflicted cruel and unusual punishment by preventing the inmate from purchasing or possessing a comb with which to comb his hair for approximately three years. The trial court dismissed the inmate's complaint. The court affirmed, although it found that the trial court erred in dismissing the inmate's second, third, and fourth claims on the basis of res judicata. The inmate failed to allege that the director authorized, approved, or knowingly acquiesced in any of the four constitutional violations that he claimed to have suffered. The claims against the director rested solely upon the fact that the director had ultimate control over the facility's employees who caused the alleged constitutional deprivations. Thus, the complaint failed to state a &sect; 1983 claim.</SPAN></P>

The court held that any violation of the Geneva Convention was not a substantive ground entitling him to relief. The prosecutor's motion to dismiss did not have to conform with Ohio R. Civ.

Defendant's claim of disproportionate application of the death penalty failed because he only offered statistics in support. His claim that the jury did not contain a fair representation of minorities failed because he failed to produce evidence. Defendant's claim of actual innocence was not in itself a ground for relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision by the Clark County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of aggravated burglary and sentenced him to prison for 10 to 25 years. He appealed from an order that overruled his post-conviction petition, which was filed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21. He claimed that he was subject to the guidelines of Am. Sub. S.B. 2, effective July 1, 1996. The conviction and sentence were before July 1, 1996.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's petition on the ground that Am. Sub. S.B. 2 did not apply to persons imprisoned prior to July 1, 1996. Defendant argued that the new sentencing law had to be applied retroactively to him or that the new law unconstitutionally denied him equal protection and due process. In response, the court took judicial notice of the fact that a number of appellate courts had already held that Am. Sub. S.B. 2 did not have retroactive application to sentences imposed prior to July 1, 1996. The court also noted that the language of the legislation itself expressly provided that it was applicable only to crimes committed after June 30, 1996. Moreover, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.48 stated that a statute was presumed prospective in its operation unless the legislature expressly indicated that it had retroactive application. The court also found that the Supreme Court of Ohio had already concluded that the refusal to apply Am. Sub. S.B. 2 retroactively to persons convicted and sentenced before July 1, 1996 did not violate those persons' rights to equal protection or due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. ch. 2950 was unconstitutional as applied to defendant. Defendant appealed the decision declaring him a sexual predator and ordering him to register as such.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to a charge of attempted rape in 1991. In 1997, the State recommended that defendant be adjudicated a sexual predator and subject to the notification requirements under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950. The trial court found that defendant did qualify as a sexual predator, but the mandates of &sect; 2950.09 were unconstitutional as applied to him under the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution and the Retroactive Clause of the Ohio Constitution. Nevertheless, the trial court ordered him to register as a sexual offender. Both parties appealed. In affirming the decision in part, the court agreed that &sect; 2950.09 was unconstitutional as applied to defendant. The actions that resulted in his conviction and sentence occurred prior to the enactment of &sect; 2950.09. In reversing the decision in part, the court found that trial court erred in ordering defendant to register as a sexual offender. He could not be ordered to register pursuant to &sect; 2950.09 for the reasons stated. If the trial court intended him to register pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.05, such order was improper because the trial court did not determine whether the requirements applied to him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision, holding that the sexual predator provisions of the statute were unconstitutional as applied to defendant. The court reversed and vacated the decision declaring defendant a sexual predator and ordering him to register as such.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State of Ohio, Department of Administrative Services challenged a decision from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which ruled that Ohio's Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) program was unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case. The Department had issued an administrative order denying appellee corporation's application for recertification as a MBE under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 122.71(E)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was solely owned by an individual who was a naturalized American citizen from Lebanon. Section 122.71(E)(1) limited Ohio's MBE program to companies owned by four economically disadvantaged racial groups: Blacks, American Indians, Hispanics and Orientals. In 1990, the corporation applied for MBE certification as an &quot;oriental&quot; company. In this application, the individual disclosed that he was born in Lebanon. The corporation was granted MBE certification as an oriental-owned company. Additionally, the corporation was recertified in each of the following three years as an oriental-owned company. In 1995, the Department refused to recertify the corporation after determining the corporation did not qualify as an oriental-owned company. The trial court determined Ohio's MBE law was unconstitutional as applied to the corporation because it violated the corporation's equal protection rights. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) all racial classifications were subject to strict scrutiny; (2) the State's MBE program was a race per se classification which, as applied to this case, was unconstitutionally applied to deny the corporation MBE certification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the Department's assignments of error. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment remanding the matter to the Department for further review of the corporation's application irrespective of race.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a minor, sought review from a judgment of the Clark County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him for two counts of aggravated robbery pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, aged 16, and his codefendant robbed two boys. The codefendant carried a gun. The juvenile court found that defendant, aged 16, committed two counts of aggravated robbery while using, displaying, brandishing or indicating possession of a firearm under his control, and bound defendant over the trial court pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.26(C)(4). On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court properly bound defendant over. Evidence that defendant told a victim that his codefendant would shoot the victim if the victim did not give defendant some money was sufficient to prove that defendant had control over a gun and used it to further his crime. Because defendant robbed one victim and aided and abetted his codefendant in robbing another, defendant could be charged with two counts of robbery. Further, defendant's conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, which included the victims' identifications, the codefendant's confession, and testimony from a person who drove defendant and the codefendant away from the crime scene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant railroad company sought review of a judgment from Erie County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which entered a jury verdict awarding appellee administrator punitive damages. The administrator cross-appealed the denial of a motion for post verdict interest on the compensatory damages award and the denial of interest on the punitive award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court previously affirmed a jury verdict in favor of the administrator, but remanded the case for the trial court to consider punitive damages. The court had also rejected the administrator's constitutional challenge to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2315.21, which reserved to the trial judge the consideration of the amount of punitive damages. After remand, the Ohio Supreme Court declared &sect; 2315.21&nbsp;unconstitutional. Therefore, a new jury was empaneled to determine the amount of punitive damages. The railroad company and administrator appealed from that judgment. The court affirmed, finding that the trial court did not err when it barred the railroad company from referencing evidence surrounding the circumstances of the accident because those issues were settled in the first trial and were irrelevant. The court held that the administrator could not contest the remittitur because she had already accepted it and that the denial of post-judgment interest on the punitive damages was based on the calculations employed in determining the remittitur. Additionally, the administrator could not raise the issue of pre-judgment interest because it had not been submitted to the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment awarding the administrator punitive damages, denying the administrator post verdict interest on the compensatory damages award and denying the administrator interest on the punitive award.</SPAN></P>
