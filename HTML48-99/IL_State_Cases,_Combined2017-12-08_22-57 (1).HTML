</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, city and city officials, sought review of the decision from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which held that Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code &sect; 8-20-200(c) was unconstitutional. Under &sect; 8-20-200(c) the city prohibited appellee gun owner from registering his handguns for failure to re-register the guns every two years prior thereto, causing him to forfeit his right to possess the guns within the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The gun owner attempted to re-register his handguns. The city denied his applications on the ground that he failed to renew previous registrations upon their expiration in violation of Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code &sect; 8-20-200(a) (1990). The gun owner appealed the decision to the city license commission, which also denied re-registration. The gun owner filed an action for administrative review. The trial court reversed the city's denial of the gun owner's applications, holding that &sect; 8-20-200(a) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that: (1) the trial court was acting within its discretionary powers in deciding to hear the constitutional issue although it was not raised in the administrative proceedings; (2) the re-registration provision of the ordinance met the rational basis test where the court could conceive of several purposes for the ordinance such as to more readily associate a handgun with its owner's current address; and (3) the existence of less onerous alternative means of securing those interests was not by itself sufficient to render the ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's decision, which found the city's re-registration requirement under its gun ban ordinance to be unconstitutional. The gun owner could be denied the right to re-register his handguns where the court could conceive of a rational basis for the re-registration requirement.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the action based on the immunity granted CTA under the Metropolitan Transit Authority Act, 70 Ill. Comp. Stat. 3605/27.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a fellow passenger assaulted the passenger on a CTA train, the passenger filed a complaint against the assailant and the CTA. Pursuant to the CTA's motion, the trial court dismissed it from the action based on its immunity under the Metropolitan Transit Authority Act. The passenger argued on appeal that, notwithstanding any immunity it may have, the CTA was liable for her injuries because it owed her a special duty. The passenger claimed that the CTA breached its duty of care by failing to provide security guards, by failing to institute appropriate security measures to protect her and other female passengers, by failing to properly train personnel regarding procedures following an attack on a passenger, by failing to implement proper procedures to notify police and security personnel when passengers were in danger, and by failing to stop assaults. The court held that the passenger's allegations were insufficient to create an issue of whether a special duty existed because they failed to establish that the CTA had direct and immediate control over her and did not allege that a public employee created a position of peril for her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing the passenger's case against the CTA on the grounds of immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An employee filed an administrative complaint with the department, alleging that the employer harassed her and gave her unequal pay on the basis of her sex. The commission granted the employer's motion to dismiss the complaint because it was filed prior to the expiration of the 300-day investigation period as provided by 775 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/7A-102(G)(1). The employee appealed, contending that she relied on information provided by the department to file the complaint and that the 30-day post-investigation appeal window period of 775 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/7A-102(G)(2) should have been tolled. On appeal, the court held that the commission's determination that the employee's complaint was untimely was correct and that equitable principles did not toll the 30-day appeal window period. The commission's interpretation, that 775 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/7A-102(G)(1) required the employee to sign and notarize her charge under oath or affirmation pursuant to Ill. Admin. Code tit. 56, &sect; 2520.330, and that the investigation period ran from the date that the employee filed a charge containing her notarized signature under oath or affirmation, was logical and correct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer sought review of an order entered by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which denied its request for a reduction in the assessed valuation of certain real property and partial refund of taxes paid in full under protest to appellee collector.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court denied the taxpayer's objection to the application of the collector for judgment and order of sale, finding that the taxpayer had failed to demonstrate actual or constructive fraud by the taxing authority and denied the objection. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that a 1995 amendment to the Property Tax Code, 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 200/23-15 applied to the case and eliminated the burden of proving constructive fraud. In the alternative, it argued that the 1994 amendment controlled and similarly removed the requirement of demonstrating fraud. Finally, it contended that even if the statutory amendments were inapplicable, it made an adequate showing of fraud. The court held that: 1) because the amendments interfered with vested rights, the controversy had to be decided under the Act as it existed at the time of trial; 2) in light of the presumptive validity of the assessment and the taxpayer's heavy burden, the trial court did not err by failing to shift the burden to the taxing authority to come forward with evidence in support of the assessment; and 3) there existed insufficient evidence to support an inference of fraud.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court in favor of the collector.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff detainee appealed from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed counts alleging that defendant City of Chicago and police officers owed plaintiff a special duty and that they acted willful and wantonly in failing to protect plaintiff, and that defendants had deprived him of his civil rights guaranteed under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, in his action to recover for injuries he sustained while being questioned by defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff detainee brought an action against defendant City of Chicago and police officers for injuries he sustained while being questioned by defendants. Upon defendants' motions, the trial court dismissed plaintiff's tort claims based upon the immunity provisions of the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act (Act), 745 Ill.

Plaintiff did not establish that defendants owed him a special duty under the Act, and failed to show that their conduct was willful and wanton, that they were indifferent to, or disregarded his safety. The court also held that plaintiff failed to allege deliberate or reckless indifference to his liberty and personal security interests sufficient to sustain his &sect; 1983 claim. Finally, the court held that plaintiff failed to state a cause of action for denial or impairment of his right of access to the courts, because he failed to show that he suffered a significant detriment as a result of defendants' objectionable conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient voluntarily dismissed her initial complaint because of her failure to file the attorney's affidavit of merit and physician's report required by 735 Ill.

The trial court dismissed the complaint with prejudice for failure to comply with the amended &sect; 2-622. On appeal, the patient contended that the old version of &sect; 2-622 should have been applied to her complaint, rather than the amended version. The court found that because the patient's refiled complaint was filed after the effective date of the amendment and was not pending at the time it became effective, the amended version of &sect; 2-622 was properly applied. The court determined that the patient had not shown good cause for her failure to provide the necessary documents under &sect; 2-622 and that the trial court properly considered the patient's delays and lack of any good cause for them in dismissing the complaint. The court concluded that under the amended &sect; 2-622, the patient could not obtain an extension to provide an affidavit of merit and physician's report, which she failed to attach to her amended complaint.</SPAN></P>

The Illinois Department of Professional Regulation informed defendant that it would not renew his license because of defendant's failure to make timely payments on his student loan. Defendant continued to practice medicine. Defendant was convicted of practicing medicine without a license. On appeal, defendant claimed that it was unconstitutional for the state to use an underlying statute that allowed the nonrenewal of a medical license when the licensee has defaulted on an educational loan in conjunction with Medical Practice Act of 1987 &sect; 50, 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 60/50, that the trial court erred when it refused to give certain jury instructions, and that prosecutorial misconduct denied defendant a fair trial. The court held that (1) 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 60/50 and &sect; 60(5) of Act 2105 of the Civil Administrative Code, 20 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 2105/60(5), bore a rational relationship to the purpose of the Medical Practice Act; (2) the trial court erred when it refused to give the jury instruction on mental state; and (3) the prosecutor's comments were improper, but they were not substantially prejudicial to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed from the order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) affirming a determination of defendant, director of the Illinois Department of Revenue (department), that the taxpayer's proceeds from the sale of a pipeline and associated realty were business income. The department appealed from the trial court's apportionment determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the taxpayer sold a portion of its pipeline, the department determined that the proceeds from the sale constituted business income and issued a notice of deficiency. The taxpayer filed a protest to the notice, and a hearing was held before an administrative law judge (ALJ), which concluded that the income was business income subject to apportionment under the special one-factor formula under 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/304(d)(2) (1994). The taxpayer sought administrative review, and the trial court upheld the determination of the ALJ. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the proceeds from the sale of the pipeline constituted business income under the functional test because the pipeline was used in the taxpayer's business operations. Further, the taxpayer failed to introduce any evidence that the sale of the pipeline did not contribute to the taxpayer's continuing business operations as a whole. With regard to the department's appeal, the court found that the plain language of &sect; 304(d) did not clearly provide for an activity analysis and found that the proceeds should not have been apportioned under the one-factor formula.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part the order holding that the proceeds from the sale of the taxpayer's property were business income.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court upheld the trial court's finding that the park district was entitled to immunity.

The court determined that plaintiff did not allege sufficient facts to satisfy the first element of the special duty doctrine. The element of direct and immediate control was lacking. The court relied on the fact that the legislature had provided municipalities with immunity for an injury caused by a failure to supervise on public property, 745 Ill. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. Defendant contended that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the state's motion to reconsider its order suppressing the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant, since that motion was filed more than 30 days after the entry of the June 29 order. Defendant further contended that the trial court erred in granting the motion to reconsider under the &quot;good faith&quot; exception to the exclusionary rule. Defendant challenged his conviction on the grounds that the evidence presented was insufficient to support his conviction. The court disagreed with defendant's contention that the trial court erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing regarding the alleged bad faith of the police officers. The court believed that it was not against the manifest weight of the evidence for a trier of fact to have found that defendant possessed the narcotics in question beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, the court concluded that a rational trier of fact could well have found the presence of the element of intent to deliver beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the defendant was not entitled to a disclosure of the state's informant because the defendant failed to offer any explanation as to how production of the confidential informant would allow him to rebut the testimony about prior drug transactions. Finally, the court found that the defendant's conviction for armed violence was proper because the handgun that was recovered from the defendant was next to his thigh and the ammunition was in his coat pocket, thereby giving him immediate access to a weapon.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, the owner and head instructor of a karate school, was accused by one of his teenage students of having a sexual relationship with her. He appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which found him guilty of criminal sexual assault under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12--13(a)(4) (1994) and sentenced him to four years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court found that the trial court improperly barred evidence under the rape shield statute, and reversed for a new trial. The defense counsel wished to impeach the victim with the testimony of three witnesses who would testify that the victim told them that she had sex with three other adult men and three witnesses (the other adult men) who would testify that they never had sex with the victim. The victim's prior sexual activity or reputation is generally inadmissible under &sect; 115--7 of Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/115--7(a) (1995). The trial court interpreted &quot;sexual activity or the reputation&quot; of the alleged victim to include her prior accusations of sexual misconduct. The court found, however, that the defense sought only to introduce evidence of the prior allegedly false statements for impeachment purposes. The statute was not designed to preclude the admission of all evidence relating to sex. The legislature intended to exclude the actual sexual history of the victim, not her prior accusations. Because there was no contention that the complainant ever engaged in sexual activity, there was no need to invoke the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The court found that the trial court's erroneously applied the rape shield statute to the facts of the case, but found in favor of the state on all other issues raised by the defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that even if appellees' belief that appellants had committed a federal crime by falsely certifying the number of students in their class to receive payment was incorrect, appellants were not coerced into resigning. Appellees had an indisputable basis for bringing dismissal proceedings, and appellants had the choice to contest those charges or resign.

In 1994, the village entered into a contract to sell the one-acre parcel to another company for a townhome development. The developer filed a petition for contempt and sought to enjoin the sale. It argued that the intent of the 1982 agreement was that the land would be used as a drainage and flood control area in perpetuity. The developer appealed the trial court's denial of its requested relief. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment from the trial court. The court held that although drainage was clearly the parties' intent in 1982, there was no evidence whatsoever of an intent that the one-acre parcel would remain open space in perpetuity. The court further held that there was nothing in the record stating that drainage was currently a problem or that the townhome development would create a drainage problem.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When appellee state sought approval to subject a ward of the state to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), appellant guardian for the ward requested and was denied an examination by an independent psychiatrist prior to the treatment. Although the trial court approved the treatment, rendering the issue moot, the court reviewed and vacated the order because it found that 405 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-110 (1994), which authorized involuntary medical treatment of state wards, violated due process protections. The objective of providing for persons without the capacity to make reasoned decisions about their need for treatment due to a serious mental illness or disability was a sufficiently compelling state interest to overcome an individual's liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatments, but for that interest to be served, the state was required to show that the individual was unable to make a rational decision for himself regarding treatment. Because the statute did not require this, it violated substantive due process. Also, the simple requirement of court &quot;approval&quot; of a guardian's informed consent was held insufficient to satisfy procedural due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the order of the trial court authorizing electroconvulsive therapy of a ward of the state because the statute under which the approval was sought violated the ward's due process protections by permitting an invasion of the ward's liberty interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff judge appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed his claim for declaratory relief on the ground that the claim presented no controversy that was ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judge made comments about a political candidate during a speech while he was a sitting appellate court justice. The judicial inquiry board sought to determine whether there was a reasonable basis to bring charges against the judge for a violation of Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 67(A)(2), 134 Ill. 2d R. 67(A)(2) and Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 67(A)(4), 134 Ill. 2d R. 67(A)(4). The judge subsequently retired from the bench and he filed an action seeking a declaration that the rules under which he was investigated were unconstitutional. The court held that the case did not present an actual controversy and that it was premature because he sought to adjudicate rights that were dependent on future events: (1) he would have had to become a sitting judge again because the challenged rule related to the conduct of sitting judges and (2) the board had to decide to reinstate its past complaint against the judge. Further, declaratory relief was not available to adjudicate nonliability for past acts. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the judge's complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of four counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault, committed upon his two daughters under 13 years of age in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-14(b) (1992). Defendant appealed, arguing, among other things, that the trial court had erroneously admitted hearsay testimony in violation of 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/115-10 (1992) and an audiotape of an interview with one victim. The court agreed that the trial court had erroneously admitted several hearsay statements that either did not involve a detail pertaining to an act committed against the declarant victim or was unclear whether it constituted such a matter, and so required reversal of the conviction. The court also held that the state did not meet its burden of establishing that statements made in a audiotaped interview of one of the victims while in the sheriff's office were sufficiently reliable in light of the frequent leading and suggestive questions to the victim and, thus, that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the audiotape. The conviction was reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retirees believed that the statutory scheme by which their retirement benefits were calculated was discriminatory, and they sought to have their benefits recalculated. The circuit court denied the recalculation. On appeal, the court affirmed. The retirees' primary contention was that the more favorable benefit calculation accorded state police under 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/14-103.12(c) denied them equal protection. They argued that because there was essentially no difference in the their job duties and those of state police officers, &sect; 14-103.12(c) created an unreasonable and arbitrary classification. The court believed that the legislature had implicitly expressed the basis for the classification at issue within the provisions of &sect; 14-103.12(c). The statutory duties of the state police were substantially broader than those of the retirees, and the legislature could have rationally sought to reward those who took on those additional duties and who continued to perform them over a long period of time. Therefore, the classification established by &sect; 14-103.12(c) of SERS did not deny the retirees equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded, however, that the survivors' failure to comply with &sect; 2-622 in the first action did not bar their refiling. The court determined that the prior dismissals resulted from procedural infirmities and the prior action did not result in an evidentiary evaluation of the merits of their medical malpractice claim. The court determined that dismissal for failure to comply with the precondition set out in &sect; 2-622 by failing to attach the required certification was akin to dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, which was a listed exception that did not bar refiling under Ill.

The court held that: (1) although the dealership was not charged with violating the banner regulation, the existence of a broadly written statute could have a deterrent effect on free expression, and the ordinance was subject to challenge by the dealership; (2) the ordinance imposed a content-based regulation on noncommercial expression, and the city 's justification that the ordinance promoted traffic safety and aesthetics was insufficient to meet its obligation of showing that the ordinance was necessary to serve a compelling state interest; (3) the invalid parts of the ordinance were not severable.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellant's action against appellees was not barred by U.S. Const. amend. XI because appellant challenged the constitutionality of appellees' action in removing it from the towing list. In addition, appellant was only seeking injunctive relief from the state and only seeking monetary damages from appellee officer in his individual capacity. However, the court held that appellant failed to allege a property interest protected by the Due Process Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the Illinois Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court convicted defendant on two counts of the offense of hate crime in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-7.1 (1994), based on his racially motivated harassment of his neighbor. The trial court fined defendant and placed him on 30 months' probation, including a term of six months in the county jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of a hate crime for his disorderly conduct in harassing a neighbor. He claimed that &sect; 5/12-7.1 was an unconstitutional infringement on free speech, was unconstitutionally vague, and was unconstitutionally overbroad. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 5/12-7 was constitutional in all respects. The state proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant knowingly acted in an unreasonable manner in order to alarm or disturb his neighbor and to provoke a breach of the peace, pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/26-1 (1994). Thus, because defendant's disorderly conduct conviction was based on racially motivated conduct, rather than solely on unpopular or bigoted speech, there was no infringement on the constitutionally protected right of free speech. Also, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-7.1 (1994) was not unconstitutionally vague because &sect; 5/12-7.1 clearly stated, in terms commonly used and understood, the nature of the offense and the guidelines for its proper application. Further, &sect; 5/12-7.1 was not overbroad because it clearly did not punish people for the mere use of words.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of the hate crime offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of aggravated arson based on evidence that he set off a bomb in the bathroom of a bar he frequented. On appeal, defendant argued that the indictment was insufficient, and that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of criminal damage to property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction arguing that the indictment was insufficient in that it did not specify that the property was damaged by means of fire or explosive. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that when such a charge was raised for the first time on appeal, the standard by which the indictment was tested was less stringent than when the sufficiency was challenged before trial. The court found that the indictment specified the date and place at which defendant was said to have violated the arson statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/20-1.1(a) (1994), which referred to arson as damage to real property by means of fire or explosive. The court held that the indictment sufficiently apprised defendant of the precise offense charged with enough specificity to allow him to prepare a defense and to allow his conviction to act as a bar to future prosecution. The court found that although criminal damage to property was a lesser-included offense of aggravated arson, defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser offense as the evidence was no extensive that a jury could not rationally have acquitted defendant of the larger offense and convicted of the lesser one.</SPAN></P>

The Board approved the nominating petition, and the circuit court affirmed the Board's decision. The challenger appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the Board's construction of the Election Code honored its letter and its spirit. The Election Code evinced a strong public policy protecting the rights of those unable to physically participate due to some disability. Reading &sect; 7-10 in pari materia with 10 Ill. Comp.

Defendant's felony sentence, after the appropriate credits were applied, was completed three months prior to the misdemeanor sentence. Defendant filed petitions for habeas corpus and mandamus, seeking an immediate release because of the completion of his felony sentence. The trial court denied the petitions, as well as defendant's motions for diminution of sentence and reconsideration. Defendant appealed, arguing that he was denied equal protection and due process because he was required to serve more prison time than someone who had received the same sentences for the same conduct, but who already happened to be serving the misdemeanor sentence, under the merger provision of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5-8-4(d). The court affirmed, finding that the merger provision did not mandate that an offender with nonmerged concurrent misdemeanor and felony sentences would automatically serve more time than an offender with merged sentences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stockholder owned shares in a corporation that was formed by a lawyer who worked for the law firm. The stockholder's ownership percentage was less than the one third required to prevent the dilution of the stockholder's ownership share.

The lower court dismissed the stockholder's action pursuant to &sect; 5/13-214.3, holding that the six year statute of repose barred the stockholder's action, and the court affirmed. The court held that the six year statute of repose began running with the formation of the corporation because the other stockholders' ability to dilute the shares sprang from the formation of the corporation and not any later acts. The stockholder's equal protection rights were not violated because the statute of repose applied to other professionals. The court ruled that the law firm was not equitably estopped from asserting that the stockholder's claim was time barred because the stockholder had ample time to comply with &sect; 5/13-214.3 after the alleged misrepresentations.</SPAN></P>

Appellant decedent's widow initiated action alleging malpractice against appellee after the will was contested in probate.

The injury that triggered the statute of limitations was appellee's breach of his duty of due care. The court found that her injury did not occur until the death of her spouse for whom appellee rendered service, and the shortened limitation period of 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13-214.3(d) (1994) applied. The court held that appellant failed to file the action within the requisite time, and it affirmed an order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed an order of the trial court, which dismissed appellant decedent's widow's malpractice action against appellee attorney. The court held that appellant's complaint was time-barred because the statute of limitations was triggered at the point where appellant first suffered damages, the point where her spouse died and not at the time of the will contest, and thus, appellant failed to file the action within the requisite time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to his retirement, the village trustees passed a resolution declaring the attorney eligible for participation in the retirement fund. The attorney enrolled as a participant and, after his retirement, the fund awarded him benefits. The village and the fund later reversed their positions and declared the attorney ineligible. The attorney argued that Ill. Const. 1970, art. XIII, &sect; 5 barred the fund from changing its position once it had accepted the village's resolution. The court disagreed and held that it was the Illinois Pension Code that determined whether the attorney was eligible for benefits, not the resolution. The court also rejected the attorney's argument that this reversal was barred by the 35-day limitations period applicable to final administrative decisions under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-103 (1992). The court held that the fund's final administrative determination was not the initial acceptance of the resolution but the later termination of benefits. The court further held that the attorney had failed to show any bias or prejudice resulting from the trial court's alleged error at an earlier stage in remanding the case to the fund and not to the village.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff borrowers appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed their claims against defendant mortgage company for violation of the Illinois Mortgage Escrow Account Act, 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. 910/1 et seq. (1992), and for violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. 505/2 (1992), after they were charged an escrow waiver fee on their home loan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff borrowers obtained a loan from defendant mortgage company to purchase a home, and chose the option of pledging a certificate of deposit sufficient to cover anticipated taxes. Defendant informed plaintiffs that they a one-time service fee applied if they exercised that option. Plaintiffs paid the charge, but then filed a class action against defendant, alleging that it violated the Illinois Mortgage Escrow Account Act (Act), 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. 910/1 et seq. (1992), by charging them and others similarly situated an escrow waiver fee, and that it violated the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (Consumer Fraud Act), 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. 505/2 (1992). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted, and plaintiffs appealed. The court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint under the Consumer Fraud Act because the parties had a legitimate disagreement over the implications of the Act, and the Consumer Fraud Act prohibited deception, not error. The court reversed the judgment as to defendant's right to impose an escrow waiver fee because by its action, defendant fee appropriated for itself the very benefit conferred upon plaintiff by the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the dismissal of plaintiff borrowers' claim against defendant mortgage company for charging them an escrow waiver fee because defendant, through the fee, appropriated the benefit that was to be conferred on plaintiff through the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant state and officials appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff citizens in an action challenging the state's two-tier system of voter registration. The state contended the court erred in holding that the two-tier system, which implemented the National Voter Registration Act, violated certain provisions of both the Illinois Vehicle Code and the State Mandates Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff citizens filed suit against defendant state and officials challenging its two-tier system of voter registration, on the grounds that it violated the notice requirements of the Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-105, the equal protection clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, and the guarantee of free and equal elections, Ill. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the citizens, holding that the two-tier system violated both the Vehicle Code and the State Mandates Act, 30 Ill. Comp. Stat. 805/3(b). On review, the state argued that the trial court's findings were erroneous. The appeals court agreed that the two-tier system violated the notice requirements of the Vehicle Code. The court rejected the state's position that posting a sign at each licensing facility was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-105, since the statute specified that each applicant must be notified. The court also ruled that because no funds were appropriated by the state for the two-tier system of registration, the local election authorities were relieved of the obligation to implement the mandate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeals court affirmed the judgment in favor of the citizens because the two-tier system of voter registration violated the voter-registration notice provisions contained in the Illinois Vehicle Code. The court ruled that the statute required that notice be given to each applicant of their right to vote in state and local elections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After an adjudicatory hearing, the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) found respondent, a 15-year-old Jewish boy, to be delinquent and adjudicated him as a ward of the court. The delinquency findings were based on an aggravated assault, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-2 (1994), and a hate crime, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-7.1 (1994), against another Jewish boy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent and other boys were playing with a broken knife when a 13-year old Jewish boy walked by them wearing a head covering and prayer tassels symbolizing his religious beliefs. The other boys shouted religious slurs against the Jewish boy and then one of them threw the knife handle at the boy. Respondent threw the knife blade at the boy. The court upheld the delinquency findings. First, the court held that Illinois' hate crime statute was constitutional. The court rejected respondent's argument that the statute violated his rights to free speech and thought, due process, and equal protection under the law guaranteed by the state and federal Constitutions. In particular, the statute did not impermissibly criminalize thought. Instead, the statute punished an offender's criminal conduct in choosing a victim by reason of his beliefs or hatred, and then committing one of the criminal acts included in 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-7.1 (1994). Finally, respondent could be guilty of a hate crime even though both he and the victim were Jewish.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that the indictment was insufficient. The court determined that the indictment was not defective for failing to allege a mental state because the statute defining the charge did not include a mental state. Defendant further contended that the trial court erred when it concluded that there was no lesser-included offense of which he could have been convicted. The court stated that the trial court had recognized that aggravated criminal sexual abuse was a lesser-included offense and the evidence supported defendant's conviction. Defendant argued that the trial court had decided, prior to the conclusion of the trial, the credibility of the witnesses and defendant's guilt. The court held that the trial court had properly weighed the credibility of the witnesses and had drawn reasonable inferences. Defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the stalking statute was unconstitutional on its face and its application to him violated ex post facto constitutional guarantees. The court held that defendant had not satisfied his burden of establishing the constitutional violations and the judgment of conviction was affirmed. The statute did not encompass innocent conduct and bore a reasonable relationship to the interest it sought to protect and the 1993 stalking statute was not void for overbreadth. Further, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as it applied to defendant. The statute clearly warned defendant that his conduct would subject him to penalty under the statute. In addition, the 1993 stalking statute was sufficiently narrow as to avoid arbitrary enforcement by the police. The statute did not violate defendant's ex post facto constitutional guarantees because defendant's conduct was unlawful under both the 1992 and 1993 versions of the stalking statute.</SPAN></P>

The officer then filed a declaratory judgment action arguing that the suspension was null and void under 65 Ill. Comp.

The trial court determined that the letter sufficiently requested a hearing, and it vacated the suspension. In reversing that judgment, the court ruled that &sect; 5/10-2.1-17 did not entitle the officer to a hearing for a three-day suspension.

The trial court sentenced defendant to 11 years imprisonment for armed robbery and 3 years imprisonment on each of the 3 counts of aggravated unlawful restraint. Defendant filed a motion to reconsider sentence, but the defense counsel did not review a transcript of the earlier proceedings as required by Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(d). The trial court denied defendant's motion. Defendant appealed asserting he was entitled to a new sentencing hearing because Rule 604(d) was not complied with. The state conceded that defense counsel's Rule 604(d) certificate did not strictly comply with the requirements, but contended defendant waived this issue. The court held that the requirements could not have been waived because compliance with Rule 604(d) was not a personal right of defendant. The court reversed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion and remanded the matter to the trial court to order transcripts of both defendant's guilty plea proceeding and his sentencing hearing and for defense counsel to file a certificate in strict compliance with all of the Rule 604(d) requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff children appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Ogle County (Illinois), which dismissed their action against defendant father. The complaint alleged childhood sexual abuse, unlawful sexual relations in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 5/11--11 (1992), and false imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the children filed their claims in 1994, they were 45 and 44 years old. The trial court concluded that the statute of repose contained in the childhood sexual abuse section of the 1991 Limitations Act, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 5/13--202.2(b) (1992), barred their claims against their father. That statute of repose barred complaints alleging childhood sexual abuse by persons 30 years of age or older. The court affirmed. The court rejected the children's argument that the 1994 amendment to the Act, which eliminated the statute of repose, applied to their claims. The court held that the father had obtained a vested right in the statute of repose contained in the original 1991 Act and that, therefore, the amended 1994 Act, which repealed the statute of repose, could not revive the children's causes of action. The court further held that the children's causes of action against their father had accrued when they reached 18 years of age and ruled that the discovery rule did not apply to cases in which plaintiffs claimed that they had repressed childhood sexual abuse from their memories.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the trial court had properly dismissed the children's complaint against their father and affirmed the trial court judgment.</SPAN></P>

R. 604(a)(1), 145 Ill. 2d R. 604(a)(1), the state sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) that granted defendants' motions to suppress evidence and to quash their arrest. Defendants were charged with possession and intent to deliver a controlled substance in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 570/401(a)(11) (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state argued that the initial seizure of the package was proper. The court affirmed the granting of the motions. The court found that the proper standard to be applied in seizing a package from the Postal Service was whether authorities had a reasonable suspicion, based upon articulable facts, that the package might have contained illicit narcotics. In this case, the express mail package met four of the drug package profile characteristics of the Postal Service, and although there were no additional factors to indicate the package was suspicious, the court concluded that the characteristics of the package provided reasonable suspicion to remove it from the mail stream for the limited purpose of further investigation. The court found, however, that the detention of the package was unreasonable and a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court considered three factors in reaching this decision: the investigatory diligence, the length of the detention, and the information conveyed to defendants and concluded that the process of the investigation was not conducted diligently and the length of the detention, more than three days, was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the jury's verdicts were legally consistent because they reasonably could have found that defendant knowingly or intentionally fired his pistol in his victim's direction with a conscious disregard for whether his actions endangered or injured her. The court also held that there was no need to sever the unlawful use of a weapon charge because there was no reasonable likelihood that testimony as to the presence of a shotgun would have been a material factor in affecting the jury's resolution of the shooting related charges, and that the evidence that defendant possessed the shotgun was clear and uncontradicted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) appealed judgments from the Circuit Courts of the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County, and the 21st Judicial Circuit, Kankakee County (Illinois) that determined the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 4/2-10, 2-27, 5-10, and 5-23 (Supp. 1995) as amended by Public Act 89-21 did not limit the trial court's power to place delinquent minors in the custody of the DCFS.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Minors who had placed in the custody of the DCFS had been adjudicated as delinquent for criminal activities. The court reversed the judgments that placed custody of the minors in the DCFS. The court observed the specific language of article II of the Public Act 89-21 that amended the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 (Act), 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/2-10(2) and 2-27(1)(d), which provided that minors charged with criminal offenses or adjudicated delinquent could not have been placed with the DCFS. The court held that the amendments were constitutional because the best interests of the child standard was maintained, and it was within the legislature's power to redefine the trial courts' ability to place minors with the DCFS within that modified contour. The court rejected an equal protection claim because juveniles were not a suspect class, and the amendment was rationally related to the Act's purpose of protecting abused, neglected, or dependent minors that had not been adjudicated delinquent. Finally, the court held that the amendments altered the DCFS's mandate under the Child and Family Services Act and did not allow for an independent basis determination for a custody petition.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded the order with respect to appellants' claims against the state officials. The court held that a writ of mandamus was appropriate to compel state officials to comply with the mandates of 1989 Ill. Pub. Act 86-273 and Ill. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The People of the State of Illinois appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss two counts against him on the basis of double jeopardy. Defendant paid a penalty and fees under a city ordinance after the seizure and impoundment of his car by the police. The criminal counts arose from the same factual transaction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested because of his actions in a domestic argument. The police found bullets on his person and a revolver in his car. The city held that defendant violated &sect; 29--48 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Aurora for the use of a car in committing certain offenses. On appeal, the court held that charging defendant a $ 500 fine and towing and storage fees was neither &quot;so extreme&quot; nor &quot;so divorced&quot; from the ordinance's nonpunitive purpose of compensating the city for the damages done by defendant. Five hundred dollars was a reasonable proxy for the likely actual administrative costs incurred by the city in preparing, prosecuting, hearing, and disposing of &sect; 29--48 complaints. The court found that the sanctions the city charged under &sect; 29--48 and the fees for towing and storage expenses incurred by the city were solely remedial in nature. Thus, the fine and fees under &sect; 29--48 did not constitute punishment for double jeopardy purposes under the federal or the Illinois constitution. The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded for further proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for first degree murder and his 50 year sentence. He claimed that plaintiff state's comments during closing and rebuttal argument denied him a fair trial. He also contended that the state improperly attempted to shift the burden of proof to defendant by making rebuttal arguments that defendant failed to produce witnesses. The court affirmed. It noted that argument that asked the jury to consider a defendant's interest in the outcome of the case in evaluating his credibility was proper. The state's comments were not improper, as they were framed as comparing defendant's credibility with the credibility of the testifying witness. The state did not urge the jury to completely disregard defendant's testimony. Where the defendant testified and asserted an affirmative defense, the state's prosecutor's passing comments about that defense were not reversible error. Insofar as the defendant bore the burden of production on the issue of imperfect self-defense where second degree murder was a possible verdict, it was questionable whether comments on whether defendant met that burden could be said to impermissibly shift the burden of proof to the defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, competitors and utility board, challenged an order of the Illinois Commerce Commission (Commission), which regulated rates and charges for noncompetitive services provided by appellee telephone company.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The competitors challenged the rates set by the Commission. The court examined the statutes addressing regulation and held that 220 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13--506.1 was a permissible use of the police power. The court held that the standards set forth in &sect; 13--506.1 were sufficiently precise to pass constitutional muster. The court held that the Commission did not ignore substantial evidence in finding the use of the telephone company's actual capital structure reasonable and that the Commission's finding that the telephone company's actual capital structure was reasonable was supported by substantial evidence. The court held, however, that the Commission applied an incorrect construction of 220 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9--230 and, in so doing, failed to apply the section at all. Rather than determining whether the telephone company's risk or capital costs were greater because of its affiliation with another company, the Commission merely determined that the telephone company's capital structure was reasonable. As a result, the Commission also failed to make a finding of fact upon a principal issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded the Commission's order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff cable companies appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which denied their motion for injunctive relief in an action challenging the validity of a municipal amusement tax, Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code &sect; 4-156-010 et seq., as applied to cable television services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The cable companies were required to collect and remit an amusement tax from their subscribers. They contended that the tax was an unauthorized occupational tax prohibited by Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6(e)(2). The court affirmed the trial court's denial of injunctive relief, holding that the imposition of an amusement tax was authorized by 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-42-5 and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the activity of viewing cable television was subject to taxation as an amusement. The court further held that the tax did not violate the Uniformity Clause, Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, merely because providers of broadcast television, movie rentals, and other services were not subject to the tax. The court held that because the tax ordinance applied to businesses other than cable service providers, it was not a &quot;franchise fee&quot; as defined in 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 542(g)(1)(A). The tax was not imposed solely because of status as a cable provider but was a tax of general applicability that was not unduly discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that appellant's amended complaint sufficiently stated a claim that the Act violated the special legislation clause, Ill. Const. art.

The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entered a directed finding for the court employees, as the class representatives failed to present a prima facie case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Class representatives alleged that the General Assembly enacted Ill. Rev.

The representatives argued that the lower court erred when it entered a directed finding in favor of the court employees, committed reversible error when it refused to admit a certified copy of the legislative debates into evidence, and abused its discretion when it refused to compel the court employees to produce documents requested under Ill.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant association sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of McHenry County (Illinois), which granted judgment in favor of plaintiff village on its condemnation complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village filed a condemnation complaint seeking to acquire an easement for the construction and installation of an underground sewer pipe on the association's land. The trial court granted judgment for the village, which the court vacated and remanded. The association's traverse and motion to dismiss should have resulted in dismissal because the village could not demonstrate its right to condemn by proper proof. A municipality could only exercise the power of eminent domain if it was specifically conferred by legislative enactment. The village's condemnation complaint alleged that it was condemning the property pursuant to 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-139-1 et seq. (1994). Once the association contested the village's right to condemn by filing a traverse and motion to dismiss, the village had the burden of establishing that it had the authority to exercise its right of eminent domain. The ordinance cited by the city was invalid because the village failed to comply with the requirements of 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-139-5 (1994). The ordinance did not set out the estimated cost of the contemplated project, the period of usefulness, or the method of defraying the cost of the project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated and remanded the trial court's decision for entry of an order dismissing the village's petition for condemnation.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 5/2-121.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The town issued citations to commercial vehicle owners for violating a local ordinance requiring the purchase and display of a town vehicle sticker on vehicles registered in the town. After a hearing, the trial court dismissed the complaints on the basis that the town ordinance was unconstitutional and exceeded the town's home rule powers to enforce a vehicle tax against commercial vehicles. The court reversed, agreeing with the town that the tax was authorized by its home rule powers. At issue was whether the phrase &quot;except commercial motor vehicles&quot; in the state statute applied to home rule units, rendering the ordinance unconstitutional. The court found it did not. The legislature was well aware that the statute was deemed not to limit home rule powers absent specific language. Having failed to enact specific language, the amended statute had no restrictive effect on home rule units.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment dismissing the town's citations to vehicle owners was reversed and the case was remanded because the legislature did not intend to deprive home rule units of the power to tax commercial motor vehicles when it amended the vehicle code.</SPAN></P>

She wrote to the village asking that &sect; 4.7 be amended to exclude pot-bellied pigs. The village served her with a complaint alleging violation of &sect; 4.7. The village informed her that before it would reconsider its position she would be required to submit a citizens' petition in support of revising the ordinance. The resident submitted the petition. The resident appeared in the trial court for a hearing on the violation. The trial court granted her a continuance on the condition that she remove the pet from the village. The resident complied with the trial court's ruling. The court reversed, in part, the trial court's decision. The court held that the fine imposed was excessive because she removed her pet from the village to prepare for trial and imposition of the fine did not aid enforcement. The court affirmed, in part, the trial court's decision. The ordinance was a legitimate exercise of the village's police power with a reasonable relationship to government interest and a rational basis for pet classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother filed a report of possible abuse of her son by his father in accordance with the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act (Act), 325 Ill.

The mother sought administrative review of the DCFS' decision to expunge the report and a declaration that the regulatory scheme which denied her standing was unconstitutional. The court held that the complaint was properly dismissed because the mother did not have standing to seek administrative review or to raise a constitutional challenge to the administrative standing provisions. The mother was not a subject of the report entitled to seek judicial review because the Act's language indicated that a person who made a report was not considered a subject and her participation in the proceeding did not vest her with party or intervenor status. Under both the Act and the Illinois Administrative Code, only decisions that denied requests for expungement were subject to judicial review. The mother also lacked standing because she had no personal claim, status, or right which would be affected by a declaratory judgment that the standing provisions were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was acquitted of a theft charge because there was insufficient evidence to establish that he had no intention of performing his promised construction duties, but was found guilty of home repair fraud because he did not rebut the state's evidence that he had failed to employ qualified personnel. The court held that the mandatory presumption of criminal intent created by &sect; 3 of the Act was invalid as violative of due process because it relieved the state of the affirmative burden of persuasion on the presumed element of intent or knowledge by providing that the trial court had to find the presumed element unless defendant persuaded it not to make such a finding. Defendant was prejudiced by the statutory presumption because the predicate facts offered by the state were insufficient to prove criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt. The doctrine of collateral estoppel precluded relitigation because the controlling issue of criminal intent had been adjudicated by the acquittal on the theft charge, which was based on the finding that defendant had not accepted money for work that he had not intended to perform.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent property owner filed an amended motion pursuant to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-1203 (1994) to vacate an order from the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) directing the county clerk to issue a tax deed to petitioner tax purchaser. The tax purchaser moved to dismiss the owner's amended motion. The trial court entered an order dismissing the amended motion. The owner appealed that order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tax purchaser successfully argued that tax deeds were incontestable under the Property Tax Code, specifically 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 200/22-45 (1994), except by filing an appeal or a petition under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-1401 (1994). The owner did not contest the issuance of the tax deed by either of these methods. The court overturned the trial court's judgment. First, it was true that 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 200/22-45 did not permit a party to contest the issuance of a tax deed by filing a motion under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-1203. For all practical purposes, 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 200/22-45 divested the trial court of jurisdiction over the matter once it entered its order, in apparent conflict with the general rule that the trial court retains jurisdiction to vacate or modify its own orders for 30 days after entry. The court ultimately concluded that &sect; 22-45 both conflicted with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 303, 155 Ill. 2d R. 303, and unduly infringed on the inherent power of the judiciary. Thus, &sect; 22-45 violated the separation of powers doctrine and was unconstitutional. The trial court erred in granting the tax purchaser's motion to dismiss the owner's amended motion.</SPAN></P>

The state filed a motion to strike the petition as insufficient under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-615 of the Civil Practice Law. The state urged the trial court to require defendant to comply with the provisions of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat.

The trial court appointed a public defender to represent defendant under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-2-4(c)(1992), but struck the petition for insufficiency. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the pleading requirements of the Civil Practice Law and &sect; 5-2-4(d) were not applicable to petitions filed by insanity acquittees under &sect; 5-2-4(e).

Under the terms of 235 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/7-13 (1992) the landowner could not operate a tavern on the property for one year following the revocation. The lower court affirmed the revocation. On appeal, the landowner claimed that the circuit court erred in striking its memorandum of law, in denying the owner's motion to realign, and in affirming the revocation of the liquor license. The court held that the legislature did not intend for the scienter requirement of 235 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/10-2 (1992) to be implied in 235 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/7-13 (1992). The court also held that 5/7-13 did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution because the liquor license was a privilege, not a property right. Further, the court held that 5/7-13 did not constitute a taking of private property in violation of the Fifth Amendment because there was no permanent deprivation of property and the landowner could use the property for other purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction was based on eyewitness testimony of two witnesses.

Also, the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing defendant to a 45 year term. The court found that defendant was properly convicted and sentenced, holding that: (1) while the admission some of the witness' prior statement was not proper, it was harmless error and did not violate the right to due process. (2) The evidence was not so incredible so as to raise a reasonable doubt as to defendant's guilt. (3) There was no proof that the trial court abused its discretion in requiring the jury to deliberate further.

The court affirmed. It rejected a claim of error in the admission of a 90-second videotape of a medical procedure because it accurately depicted decedent's diseased lungs. It also declined to reverse based on the use of a mortality table showing life expectancies of surviving family members because there was no reason to believe that its use, albeit erroneous, either misled the jury or prejudiced the manufacturer. The court also found that other claimed errors, including errors relating to the language of a jury instruction and to the reading of certain expert testimony, were waived. While the verdict form that was used was incorrect, the court had no reason to conclude that its use inflated the total award. The court also declined to overturn the verdict based on amount alone. While refusing to set out a litmus test for generally determining when an award was unreasonable, the court found that, based on the evidence and the applicable law, the manufacturer was not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The license holder obtained a license to conduct commercial teen dances and operate a teen nightclub.

The court affirmed the circuit court's holding that the ordinance was facially unconstitutional as violative of equal protection. The court examined the evidence and held that the circuit judge's implicit finding that the restraints imposed by the ordinance were not necessary to secure the common welfare was not against the manifest weight of the evidence and that he did not abuse his discretion when he granted the preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of the ordinance. The evidence established teen dances held in hotels or sponsored by non-profit groups were no safer than teen dances that were held elsewhere or sponsored by for-profit enterprises.

On appeal defendant contended in part that the state failed to prove him guilty of criminal sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt and that &sect; 12-13(a)(4) of the Criminal Code of 1961 was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed. First, the court held that the state produced sufficient evidence that defendant occupied a position of trust or supervision in relation to the victim. Second, the court rejected defendant's argument that the phrase &quot;held a position of trust, authority or supervision&quot; in &sect; 12-13(a)(4) was so vague and undefined that it left enforcement of the law to the whim of the arresting officer, judge or jury. The terms &quot;trust,&quot; &quot;authority,&quot; and &quot;supervision&quot; were sufficiently definite to warn potential defendants of the type of conduct that was prohibited and to channel the discretion of police, judges, and juries. Finally, the court held that &sect; 12-13(a)(4) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

The representatives sought injunctive relief prohibiting vouchers or warrants authorizing expenditure of the appropriated funds arguing that under &sect; 8.3 of the State Finance Act, 30 Ill. Comp. Stat. 105/8.3 (1994), monies in the Road Fund may be appropriated to the Department of State Police only under certain conditions which were not met in this case. The officials sought review of the trial court decision granting the preliminary injunction on the basis that the legislature could not amend a substantive bill with an appropriation bill. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment from the trial court. The court held that the General Assembly attempted with the appropriation to allocate monies from the Road Fund to the State Police in violation of the State Finance Act. The court further held that if the additional $ 15,792,000 were needed for police services, all that would be required is for the General Assembly and the governor to enact into law either a supplemental appropriations bill or amend the State Finance Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient claimed the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow the case to be tried on the merits. The patient filed an unsworn, undated affidavit declaring that his witness was knowledgeable in the relevant issues and had determined in a written report that there was a meritorious cause of action. The affidavit stated that it was made under oath, however, spaces for the date and signature of a notary public were left blank. There was no indication that an oath was actually administered. The witness states in his report that he was not a surgeon and that he was unable to assess whether the doctor was negligent. The court held the patient did not submit an adequate health professional's report or attorney affidavit, and the trial court acted well within its discretion in dismissing the action after providing plaintiff with numerous opportunities to comply with Ill. Code Civ. P. 735, Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-622. The trial court made every reasonable effort to afford the patient extra time to comply.

The court affirmed, concluding that although defendant was not convicted of a violation of &sect; 401 of the Controlled Substances Act, the violation upon which the forfeiture was based, she was prosecuted for it, and the double jeopardy clause prohibited multiple prosecutions for the same offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with two counts of criminal sexual assault and one count of aggravated criminal sexual assault. Defendant pleaded not guilty and demanded a jury trial. Defendant then orally waived his right to a jury trial, but no written waiver was executed.

The court reversed the judgment and held that, pursuant to &sect; 5/115-1, defendant could not have waived his right to a jury trial without the waiver having been in writing. The purpose of the statute effectuated the constitutional right to a jury trial. No court rules conflicted with the written waiver requirement, so the statute did not violate the separation of powers clause of the state constitution.

However, the state's highest court then ruled that the arson statute was unconstitutional. Defendant successfully filed a petition for habeas corpus, which the trial court granted.

Ann. &sect; 5/3-4(d)(2) the state was allowed to reprosecute if subsequent proceedings resulted in the invalidation, setting aside, reversal, or vacating of the conviction, unless defendant thereby was adjudged not guilty. Contrary to defendant's assertion, the writ of habeas corpus was not the functional equivalent of an acquittal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state filed an action against defendant to recover the costs of incarceration pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-7-6. At trial, defendant presented no evidence, and the state prevailed. Defendant appealed, asserting that the statute was unconstitutional as violative of the ex post facto clause, constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment, was a due process violation, and that the state did not prove his ability to pay. The court affirmed and found that the ex post facto clause only applied to penal statutes and that the statute at issue was not penal in nature. Using the same analysis, the statute was not cruel and unusual punishment, either. As to the due process allegation, the court held that the statute was not void for vagueness and it clearly informed defendant of the elements of the statute. Further, as the statute was compensatory and not penal, the vagueness analysis was not applicable. Finally, the court found that defendant was required to show his inability to pay in order for that issue to be considered. As defendant did not make that showing, it was not considered.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial judge's instruction to the jury that no defense reports were in evidence was prejudicial. The court concluded that the trial court did not commit reversible error by accurately responding to the jury's request. The court held that no violation of the separation of powers doctrine occurred by virtue of the state's decision to present evidence of defendant's convictions in cases originating in juvenile court. The court also held that the trial court properly considered defendant's transferred cases in sentencing him as an habitual offender. The court found that the state met its burden of establishing defendant's eligibility to be sentenced as a habitual offender.

When he failed to comply with the order, the department filed a complaint with the Board of Dentistry (board) seeking to revoke or suspend his license. The board recommended to the director of the department that the dentist's license be suspended until he completed the courses. The director suspended the dentist's license. The dentist then filed a complaint for administrative review, naming the director as the sole defendant. The trial court dismissed the complaint with prejudice as being noncompliant with the Administrative Review Law, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-107. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that because both the director and the department were parties to the proceedings, the clear and unambiguous language of &sect; 3-107 required that they both be named and served. In addition, the court refused to retroactively apply the amendment to &sect; 3-107, which would have provided the dentist with time to correct the defect, finding the amendment to be substantive rather than procedural, thus necessitating prospective not retroactive application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village brought a declaratory judgment action against the Department of Agriculture (department) and sought to have an amendment to the Pesticide Act declared unconstitutional. The trial court granted the department's motion to dismiss and the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the village was not a &quot;person&quot; as that term was embraced by the equal protection provisions U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 2 (1970). The court held that the village had no standing to pursue its due process and equal protection challenges to P.A. 88-345. The court held that the rational basis test applied and that such test did not require the legislature to explain why it drew the line at 2 million people. The court held that mathematical precision in creating a classification was not required. The court held that the village had not established in its pleadings that the general assembly failed the rational basis test. The court held that it was not unreasonable to presume that large population centers would have the resources, expertise, and will to deal with the regulation of pesticides. The court found that the amendment was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Adams County (Illinois), which convicted him of unlawful possession of a controlled substance, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 570/402 (1992), and permitting the unlawful use of a building, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 570/406.1 (1992). The trial court sentenced him to four years' imprisonment on each count, with the sentences to run concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for permitting the unlawful use of a building, arguing the statute was unconstitutional and he was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the language of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 570-406.1(a) was not so vague that persons of common intelligence could not assess its meaning or application. Because 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 570-406.1(a) contained a criminal knowledge element, the statute was not overly broad and did not penalize innocent behavior. The court rejected defendant's argument that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 570-406.1(a) and 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/37-1 prohibited the same acts and imposed different penalties. While an individual charged with permitting an unlawful use of a building could also be charged with maintaining a public nuisance, the opposite was not always true. Accordingly, the statutes were not identical and did not violate the constitutional prohibition against disproportionate penalties. From the evidence, any rational trier of fact could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant exerted control over the residence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and defendant's convictions for unlawful possession of a controlled substance and permitting the unlawful use of a building.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, holding that defendant was entitled to a new trial because 725 Ill. Comp.

Comp. Stat. 5/7.16 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, 325 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/21 et seq. (1994), to expunge his name from the state register of child molesters. The Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) ruled for the accused. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The accused's hearing to expunge his name from the state register of child molesters was held 299 days after his request. The Department's denial was 581 days after his request. The court affirmed the decision to expunge his name. The accused had a protected liberty interest in not having been listed on the register because the listing endangered his employment as a teacher and endangered his teaching certificate under 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/21-23(b) (1994) and his ability to obtain certain employment under 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/8(9) (1994). Thus, the listing affected more than his reputation. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, 325 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/7.16 (1994), and Ill. Admin. Code tit. 89, &sect; 336.110(d)(1) (1994) entitled the accused to a timely hearing to expunge his name. The court held that the delay violated this right, he did not waive the argument, and he did not have to proceed in mandamus to correct the delay. The credible evidence standard of Ill. Admin. Code tit. 89, &sect; 336.130(b)(14) violated the accused's due process rights because the standard of proof should have been preponderance of the evidence, which was not met.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant longshoreman filed claims for workers' compensation coverage under the Illinois Workers' Compensation Act and under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 901 et seq. Appellee Illinois Industrial Commission (commission) awarded benefits. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) upheld the award in part. The longshoreman and appellee stevedore company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stevedore company argued that the commission lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the longshoreman's application for benefits. It contended that at the time of the injury, the longshoreman was injured while performing his duties over navigable waters of the United States; that injuries sustained by the longshoreman were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the LHWCA; and that the longshoreman could only be compensated under the provisions of the LHWCA. The court agreed, holding that the commission lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the longshoreman's application for benefits and to award benefits because his claim for compensation for his injury fell within exclusive federal jurisdiction. Under the Jensen doctrine, states could not constitutionally apply their workers' compensation statutory schemes to maritime employees who were performing traditional maritime functions and were injured over navigable waters. Working as a longshoreman was clearly a traditional maritime activity. Moreover, longshoremen injured over navigable waters fell outside the concurrent jurisdiction of the Davis &quot;twilight zone.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court found that the parents had not alleged actionable conduct that was arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious, and their complaint failed to state a cause of action under Ill. Const. art. X. The court concluded that the right to a high quality education was not a &quot;fundamental right&quot; for purposes of an equal protection claim. The court found that the parents' complaint had failed to set forth factual allegations of disparate treatment that was not rationally related to a governmental purpose. The court reasoned that the state's reliance on residence for school assignment determinations was rationally related to the purpose of providing an educational system to all residents.

On appeal, the court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the matter for resentencing, holding that the statutes were constitutional. However, the order of protection entered into evidence by the state did not state the reason that it was issued. The state presented no testimony concerning the circumstances leading up to the issuance of the order. Defendant argued that the state failed to establish the predicate threat beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the standard of proof which had to have been met at an order of protection hearing was only a preponderance of the evidence. That burden did not satisfy the quantum of proof required to sustain a criminal conviction. Thus, standing alone, the order of protection did not constitute sufficient evidence that defendant threatened the victim. Nothing in the record showed that defendant expressed an intent to harm the victim. Therefore, there was no proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a predicate threat.</SPAN></P>

The city argued that &sect; 8-4-015 was a valid exercise of its police power and that it did not violate the U.S. or Illinois Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were arrested for loitering and charged with violating the ordinance in the city that was aimed at curbing street gangs. During their prosecution, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the motion, and the city appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance violated defendants' freedoms of association, assembly, and expression secured by the First Amendment and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. It had a chilling effect on those rights. It was unconstitutionally vague, so it violated defendants' due process rights. The ordinance unconstitutionally criminalized status by prohibiting gang members from loitering because they were gang members, not because they were loitering. It was the status, not the conduct that triggered the ordinance. Criminal penalties could be imposed only if there was a criminal act. The ordinance allowed arrests without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment. In fact, the ordinance appeared to be a transparent attempt to avoid the probable cause requirement.</SPAN></P>

The matter was tried by a jury and resulted in an acquittal. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the trial court's order requiring defendant to reimburse the county for the public defender's services was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence and an abuse of discretion. There was no evidence that defendant had any funds or any foreseeable ability to pay attorney fees. The court rejected the State's suggestion that the hearing passed constitutional due process muster because the boyfriend never testified that any recoupment would result in a financial burden to him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both plaintiff Medicaid facility and defendants, Illinois Department of Public Aid (IDPA) and director, appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which, on cross-motions for summary judgment, held that the 1985 regulation was arbitrary and capricious and violated Illinois statutory law, but ruled that the Medicaid facility had failed to prove any damages and denied its motions to amend its complaint and for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Medicaid facility challenged the validity and legality of a regulation, Ill. Admin. Code tit. 89, &sect; 140.571(e), promulgated by IDPA. The circuit court granted the Medicaid facility summary judgment on its claims that the 1985 amendments were invalidated and violated part of the Medical Assistance Act, 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-1 et seq. (1992), but it ruled against the Medicaid facility otherwise. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment to the Medicaid facility due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Sovereign immunity mandated that the state or a department of the state could not be a defendant in an action brought directly in the circuit court, 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 505/1 et seq. (1992). Where a judgment for the Medicaid facility would operate to control IDPA action or subject it to damage liability, the action was effectively against the state and was barred. Where the IDPA and its director were named as defendants and no writ of mandamus was sought against the relevant state officer, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction. Also, it was not error to deny the Medicaid facility leave to amend because its amendment did not go to the jurisdictional question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the circuit court's grant of summary judgment to the Medicaid facility on two counts and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion and with directions to dismiss both counts for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff village filed a suit against defendant department of transportation (department) and construction company (company) alleging trespass. The department filed a motion to dismiss, and the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted the motion. The company then filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the department was a necessary party to the action. The trial court granted the motion, and the village appealed both orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village's suit was based on the department's and company's construction work on land allegedly owned by the village. The trial court held that because of sovereign immunity of the department, it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action pursuant to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-619(a)(1). The court held that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to resolve the property dispute in this matter because the Court of Claims had exclusive jurisdiction over all claims against the state founded upon any law in Illinois. The court held further that even if the village had no remedy available in the Court of Claims, codification of public policy was for the legislature, and the lack of a remedy could not grant jurisdiction to a circuit court over subject matter which was specifically barred by statute. In addition, in regard to the company's claim that the department was a necessary party, the court held that because the village failed to cite any authority to support its claim that the department was not a necessary party, the village waived this argument in its appeal.</SPAN></P>

Based on this, the director of the department of insurance's made the decision to revoke the broker's insurance producer's license. The decision was affirmed by the lower tribunals. The court affirmed, holding that an insurance producer's license could be revoked for incompetence, untrustworthiness or financial irresponsibility, even if unrelated to the insurance business.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of attempted first degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm, and aggravated battery after he shot his former girlfriend. Defendant argued that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/6-2(e), 5/3-2(b) (1992) were unconstitutional because they required a higher burden of proof on defendant on his insanity defense than was required for other defenses. Defendant also appealed the denial of his petition for post-conviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The court affirmed the judgments and held that the statutes did not violate equal protection because defendant did not belong to a suspect class and the defense was not a fundamental right, so under the rational relation test, the requirement for proof was rationally related to legitimate purpose of preventing the fabrication of insanity claims and thereby thwarting justice. The court also held that defendant was not entitled to a post-conviction petition because his attorney's decision to enter into plea negotiations and call witnesses was within his professional judgment, and the argument that counsel should have more forcefully sought continuance could have been properly raised on an appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted after a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Livingston County (Illinois) of aggravated criminal sexual abuse under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-16(c)(1)(i) (1992). Defendant appealed, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, the waiver of his right to a jury trial, and the failure of the trial court to have ordered sua sponte a fitness hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The findings of a physical examination of the two-year-old victim were consistent with sexual abuse. In open court, defense counsel, after admonishment by the trial court, stated that defendant waived his right to a jury trial. Before trial, defense counsel asked to employ a psychiatrist to determine defendant's fitness, but no motion was filed. The presentence report stated that defendant received psychiatric treatment and suffered a chemical imbalance. The court held that under the circumstances, the waiver was knowingly made. Failure to obtain a written waiver did not always require reversal. In defendant's case, the error was harmless. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not ordering sua sponte a fitness hearing prior to trial or sentencing under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/104-11(a) (1992). There was no evidence as to the nature of the treatment that defendant received. Defendant's conduct at trial showed that he understood the proceedings. The trial court properly allowed defendant to introduce trial testimony of his reputation for good moral character but not testimony of specific acts or personal opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual assault, aggravated unlawful restraint, stalking, aggravated stalking, attempted first-degree murder, and aggravated discharge of a weapon. The court affirmed in part and vacated in part. The court held that defendant was not denied his constitution right to testify on his own behalf because the trial court's admonitions, which allegedly caused defendant to forego testifying, were not improper. The court found that the trial court's comments were not intimidating or threatening, instead the admonishments were given in a proper manner, and the court did not depart from its neutral judicial role. The court found that defendant's conviction for aggravated discharge of a firearm could not stand because the attempted murder count was based on the same act by defendant, thus the greater offense of attempted murder was affirmed, and the conviction for aggravated discharge of a firearm was vacated. Similarly, because stalking was a lesser-included offense of aggravated stalking, defendant's stalking conviction was also vacated.</SPAN></P>

A final order under &sect; 5/28-4 imposed procedural requirements and was final only as to those requirements. It did not confer jurisdiction on the appellate court, even if the trial court stated that it was appealable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted that (1) the Home Repair Fraud Act (Act), 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. 515/1 et. seq. (1992), violated state and federal due process of law in that it did not require a culpable mental state; (2) the Act's penalty provisions violated state and federal due process of law and equal protection because the class of penalty was increased on the basis of the contract's amount instead of the value of the actual loss or harm caused; and (3) his sentence violated due process of law and the constitutional assurances of proportionate penalties. The court held that the Act: (1) criminalized conduct based on fraud or deceptive practices used in the field of home repairs and did not include potentially innocent conduct within its scope; (2) was rationally related to the legislature's goal in enacting it; (3) was a reasonable means of achieving the legislative goal because it operated to criminalize precisely the type of conduct that the legislature sought to prevent by its enactment; and (4) was constitutional on its face.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant attorney appealed the order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed with prejudice several counts of his counterclaim to plaintiff publisher's cause of action for breach of contract due to the attorney's alleged failure to pay for charges associated with classified advertisements in a telephone directory. The counts in question alleged a violation of the attorney's civil rights and the commission of a tort.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney defended against the publisher's breach of contract action by contending that the publisher violated his civil rights in causing the sheriff to attempt service at his business office on 12 occasions while knowing that the attorney would not be present and that the publisher thereafter obtained and published in the complaint his private residential address and telephone number. The court rejected all of the attorney's claims and concluded that the publisher's actions of misusing process service procedures, as alleged by the attorney, could not be attributed to state policy and thus did not state a cause of action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. In addition, the allegations were insufficient to establish the requisite color of law because there was no allegation of joint participation between the private party and state officials. The sheriff's serving process was, therefore, mere ministerial action which was insufficient for state participation because it was not wrongful in and of itself. Finally, the obtaining of the attorney's address was not tortious conduct but breach of contract, and the attorney should have sued on a tortious interference with a contract claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order of the trial court that dismissed those counts of the attorney's counterclaim alleging violation of civil rights and commission of a tort.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The companies brought an action in equity seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the city alleging that, pursuant to Chicago Municipal Code &sect; 3-32-010 et seq.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in part and reversed in part. The court held that although equity is generally not available to provide tax relief where an adequate remedy at law is available, it is permitted where a tax is alleged to be unauthorized by law. The court further held that the complaint sufficiently alleged that the transaction tax imposed on the companies amounted to an occupation tax that is unauthorized within the meaning of Ill.

Defendant had not raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in his post trial motion or the appeal of his conviction and the trial court's denial of the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order that denied defendant's post conviction petition, finding first that defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not waived by failure to raise it in the post trial motion because trial counsel still represented defendant at that point and raising the issue would have caused a conflict of interest. However, since the original appellate record had been sufficient to support an argument that trial counsel may have been ineffective in handling the victim's identification and testimony, the court held that defendant had waived his right to raise the issue in his post conviction petition.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court properly determined that the township lacked standing to bring a claim challenging the classification of zoning authority.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, individuals and a high school board, appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County, Illinois, which affirmed the decision of defendant regional board of school trustees approving a petition filed under &sect; 7-2b of the School Code, 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/7-2b (Supp. 1995), for the annexation of territory from plaintiffs' high school district to defendant high school board's district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs first argued that the regional board's approval of the 1993 petition was void because, under the &quot;first in time&quot; principle, the 1993 petition should have been held in abeyance pending the outcome of the appeal regarding the 1992 petition. However, application of the &quot;first in time&quot; principle would not serve the ends of justice. The only justification for applying that principle would be to deter regional boards and school superintendents from considering &sect; 7-2b petitions in future cases where to do so would risk invalidation of a petition under 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/7-8 (Supp. 1995). Section 7-8 had been amended to exclude 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/7-2b (Supp. 1005) petitions from its purview. As a result, the risk taken by the regional board would not arise in the future. The court declined to invalidate the 1993 petition. Also, &sect; 7-2b was not a delegation of legislative power to private individuals in violation of Article IV, section 1 of the Illinois Constitution. The provision granted a privilege of organizing school districts subject to specific rules and conditions, and was not an unconstitutional delegation of lawmaking authority.</SPAN></P>

The court found that petitioners' failure to comply with certain technical requirements of &sect; 10-8, such as their failure to file a duplicate copy of their objections, did not render the objections insufficient. The court also found that petitioners properly stated their interests and the relief requested.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of two counts of armed robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with two counts of armed robbery, was found guilty, but was granted a new trial based on the unconstitutionality of a statute that allowed the state to demand a jury trial. During a second trial, and a mistrial was declared after the jury was unable to return a verdict. Defendant was tried for a third time and was convicted. Prior to the first trial, defendant's motion to suppress his pretrial identification was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed, in part, and held that the showup was proper because the facts demonstrated that the witnesses saw defendant in good light, had ample opportunity to view him, and did so with attention. The court found that there was no evidence in the record to support the lesser-included offense charge and that no jury could have rationally found defendant guilty of theft. The court held that the defendant never objected to the prior consistent statement testimony but that, regardless, the statement fell within an exception to the hearsay rule. Defendant was improperly convicted of two counts of armed robbery based on a single act, and the court remanded the case with directions to reflect only one conviction for armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

Stat. 5/33A-2 (1993), and aggravated battery of a senior citizen in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-4.6(a) (1993). Defendants were involved in a dispute and then a shootout in which a bystander was wounded. The court vacated defendants' aggravated battery of a senior citizen convictions and reversed their aggravated battery with a firearm convictions. The court held that accountability and the doctrine of transferred intent was inapplicable to the case, and concluded that although one defendant shot the bystander, the state failed to show which one and thus, failed to prove either beyond a reasonable doubt of aggravated battery with a firearm. The court affirmed defendants' aggravated discharge with a firearm conviction and remanded their case to the trial court for resentencing. On this charge, the state successfully proved that each defendant knowingly discharged a firearm in the direction of another person.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the language of the statute was understandable in the factual context of the case and was amply clear for any person of reasonable or limited intelligence to understand that it was not permissible to discharge a weapon in the direction of another person.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated appeal, first defendant and second defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Macon County (Illinois), which convicted them of three counts of attempted first degree murder and one count of aggravated discharge of a firearm, and two counts of attempted first degree murder and two counts of aggravated discharge of a firearm, respectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, first defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his nickname, and second defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of attempted first degree murder. Both defendants contended that they were denied effective assistance of counsel and that the statutory provisions creating the offense of aggravated unlawful discharge of a firearm were unconstitutional. Upon review, the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The trial was heard at bench, and nothing in the record indicated that the trial court gave any substantial consideration to the evidence of first defendant's nickname. Even if second defendant was surprised the first time first defendant shot, the evidence fully supported a determination that he thereafter cooperated with the intent of aiding first defendant in shooting at the victims. In addition, both defendants received effective assistance of counsel. Under the statute concerning the unlawful discharge of a firearm, every one of the circumstances covered involved the firing of a firearm under circumstances that were extremely dangerous. That, of itself, was enough to justify the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The department argued that the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment and enjoin the department's investigation should be reversed because the trial court erred in finding that the Illinois Hospital Licensing Act, codified at 210 Ill.

The court held that the trial court misinterpreted the grant of absolute immunity from civil damages provided in the Human Rights Act &sect; 10.2, codified at 775 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/8A-104 (1992), as a grant of absolute immunity from all legal liability. The court reversed the trial court's judgment.

The driver commenced suit in the circuit court to reinstate his driving privileges. The secretary filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The circuit court granted the motion. The driver sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that (1) the Safety Law offered procedural due process protection to drivers who were unable to post security; (2) the secretary followed the Safety Act in mailing the hearing notice to the driver and the mailing was reasonably calculated to provide actual notice; (3) the driver had the obligation to instruct the secretary that he had moved; and (4) the Safety Law did not violate the driver's equal protection rights because it the purpose of the statute had a rational relationship to a legitimate government purpose.</SPAN></P>

A plaintiff who suffered injury in fact to a legally recognized interest had standing. The taxpayer presented a challenge to the use of public resources, which was sufficient to confer standing. However, the taxpayer did not assert that any state tax funds had been appropriated for use in performing the abortion procedures. The complaint was insufficient because it did not contain any factual allegations that the taxpayer's tax obligation to the state had or would be affected by the reinstatement of the procedures.</SPAN></P>

Stat. 5/12-11.1 (1992), and sentenced defendant to six years imprisonment as a Class X offender based upon two prior Class two felony convictions. The defendant appealed, questioning whether 720 Ill.

Stat. 5/111-3(c) (1992), and whether the mittimus issued required correction. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the designation of vehicular invasion a Class 1 felony was not so wholly disproportionate as to shock the community's moral sense, that the mittimus properly noted that defendant was sentenced to a six year prison term followed by three years of mandatory supervised release, and that the gravity of conduct offensive to the public safety and welfare, authorizing Class X sentencing, justifiably required lengthier watchfulness after prison release than violations of a less serious nature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner residents sought review of an order of respondent Pollution Control Board (Illinois), dismissing their complaint against respondent sports club and village, which alleged that the sports club's shooting activities caused noise pollution in violation of the Environmental Protection Act, 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/23, 5/24 (1992) and Ill. Admin. Code tit. 35, &sect;&sect; 900.102, 901.102(a), 901.104 (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court affirmed, finding that the sports club was exempt from the noise standards pursuant to 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/25 (1992) as an organized amateur sporting activity and that 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/24 (1992) did not provide a general cause of action. No cause of action existed pursuant to Ill. Admin. Code tit. 35, &sect; 900.102 (1991), which was subject to the exemption of 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/25, 5/3.25 (1992). The club's shifting of locations did not affect the exemption because it had been continuously involved in skeet and trap shooting since it was founded in 1944. The exemption extended to the village, which had no ownership interest in the club, and the fact that the village assisted the club in the setting up its facilities did not establish that it was responsible for the noise resulting from the use of those facilities. The board applied all of the necessary criteria in determining that the club was exempted under the Act. Although the club's articles of incorporation failed to include a reference to shooting activities, that did not render the exemption inapplicable. Finally, the court concluded that &sect;&sect; 5/25, 5/3.25 were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the board's order dismissing the residents' complaint against the sports club and village.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of aggravated criminal assault for inappropriately touching the minor child of his girlfriend. On appeal, defendant argued that his sentence was excessive, that &sect; 5-4-3 of the Unified Code of Corrections (Code), 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-4-3 (1992), was unconstitutional, and that he was improperly certified as a child sex offender under the Child Offender Act (Act), 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 150/1 et seq. (1992). The court affirmed the conviction. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant because the sentence was within the guidelines and the fact that defendant acted as father figure to a very young victim justified his sentence. The court held that &sect; 5-4-3 of the Code, which required those convicted of sexual offenses to submit blood samples, did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV because the governmental interest in having a permanent identification record from a prisoner outweighed the minor intrusion. The statute was not unreasonable under the state constitution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for stalking his ex-girlfriend. He appealed the conviction and his sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the &quot;remaining present outside&quot; language in the stalking statute required judicial construction because its application was not clear and unambiguous. The court found that the statute encompassed the surveillance of a person from a place within the same primary structure but distinct from the &quot;other place occupied by&quot; the person. The court also found that, combined with defendant's prior conduct, the evidence was sufficient to find a &quot;substantial probability&quot; that defendant knew his behavior placed the victim in reasonable apprehension of harm. Additionally, the court rejected defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the statute. It found that the statute contained sufficiently objective standards of conduct and knowledge to allow its valid application. The court also noted that although the statute was relatively broad, it did not substantially infringe upon constitutionally protected behavior or expression either generally or as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

Appellants sought a review of the PCB's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants argued that the business owner failed to properly plead and prove that he was so located as to be affected by the proposed facility under 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/40.1(b) (1992) of the Environmental Protection Act. In affirming the PCB's decision, the court held that the business owner had standing to challenge the county board's approval of the proposed landfill site. The court held that compliance with the individual notice requirements of 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/39.2(b) (1993) was a jurisdictional prerequisite to the county board's authority to act over a given landfill proposal. Any order entered in the absence of such compliance was void in that the county board entering the order would lack the inherent power to enter the particular order involved. The landfill operator's alleged failure to comply with &sect; 39.2(b) rendered the county board's approval void and left the order subject to attack at any time or in any court. Furthermore, the business owner's standing as a person who was affected by the proposed facility pursuant to 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/40.1(b) (1992) was sufficient to give him standing to challenge the validity of the county board's approval.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Airport Departure Tax Ordinance, Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, Ill., Airport Departure Tax Ordinance &sect; 1-3 (1992), imposed an occupation tax on all commercial vehicle operators departing from a metropolitan airport. The tax was to assist in financing an expansion project. The operators and passengers challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. The trial court dismissed the complaint and the court affirmed. Although the burden of the tax was passed on to the passengers, the court held that their claim failed because the incidence of the tax rested on the operators. The court held that the ordinance did not violate the operators' due process, equal protection, or uniformity clause rights. The court noted that the operators benefited directly from the project and that they failed to establish a distinction between classes of operators who were taxed and those who were not. The scheme was found to be a workable method to tax those who would benefit directly from the project and reasonably related to its goal. The ordinance did not violate the commerce clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because it was imposed only on operators doing business within the state.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that defendant's excluded testimony might have affected the outcome of the case, and that the exclusion was plain error, requiring reversal of the conviction. The court determined that the omission of the not guilty verdict form constituted plain error and denied defendant a fair trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Vermilion County (Illinois), which vacated consecutive 25-year terms for armed robbery, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 18-2(a) (1991), and attempted first-degree murder, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 8-4, 9-1(a) (1991), and resentenced him to 30 years for the attempted murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sentencing range for attempted first degree murder was 6 months to 30 years under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-1(a)(3) (1992). Defendant contended that his sentence was improperly increased and excessive given his potential for rehabilitation, the influence of drugs upon him during the offense, and the suggestions by others that he commit the crime. The trial court denied his supplemental motion to reconsider the sentence. He sought vacation of the sentence and a minimum or lesser term. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 615(b)(4) did not permit it as a reviewing court to reduce the sentence unless it constituted an abuse of discretion. There was no abuse of discretion in resentencing when the sentence was significantly reduced by 20 years. The court held that Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 615(b)(4) did not permit a reviewing court to reduce any sentence that conformed to the law, absent an abuse of discretion, or to select a lesser sentence to impose. 36 Ill. 2d R. 615(b)(4). The 30-year sentence fell within the statutory guidelines and the trial court had considered aggravating and mitigating factors the three times it addressed the sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a single mention of the life sentence awaiting defendant without any other consideration in the record of the potential penalty was sufficiently explicit for meaningful review.

The court allowed jurisdiction for the appeal and held that the prosecution was impaired in the case because it had the burden of presenting evidence for conviction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois), which convicted him of official misconduct. Defendant objected to the denial by the trial court of his motions to suppress and for a mistrial and to its refusal to sever and order separate trials on the various charges against him. Defendant also argued that the evidence against him was insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Various female probationers accused defendant, who was a probation officer, of engaging in sexual improprieties with them in his office. At trial, a police veteran testified that one of the victims agreed to take a polygraph examination. The court held that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial. The court noted the substantial conflict in the testimony of defendant and his victims and reasoned that the improper polygraph reference could have substantially enhanced the credibility of the one particular victim in the eyes of the jury. Reference to probation department personnel policies was not required to establish defendant's guilt because his sexual acts with probationers during the course of official duties clearly exceeded the scope of his lawful authority. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not ordering separate trials because defendant's other crimes would have been admissible as modus operandi. Finally, the trial court did not err by refusing to suppress defendant's statement to investigators because he was not physically restrained and therefore was not in custody for Miranda purposes when he have his statement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff beneficiaries filed a legal malpractice action against defendant attorneys for damages that allegedly resulted from the drafting of a will.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent left a will that was drafted by the attorneys and the beneficiaries were appointed as executors.

The note stated that they and 42 days to file a petition with the court. One of the heirs filed a petition and stated that she had knowledge that the beneficiary who declined to serve as executor was going to protest the will, which the lower court denied. After distribution of the estate, the beneficiaries filed their complaint against the attorneys who drafted the will under a breach of contract and negligence theory. The court determined that the beneficiaries were required to file their action one year prior to when they did and it was therefore barred by the statute of limitations. The court stated that the beneficiaries had actual notice of any alleged defects within the period of the statute of limitations and it did not matter whether the attorneys were the source of that actual knowledge. The court held that the beneficiaries' claim was barred under &sect; 13-214.3(d).</SPAN></P>

Women who chose not to pay the cover charge could not partake of the buffet and were not entitled to free drinks. Men were required to pay the cover charge, could not partake of the buffet, and were required to pay the regular price for drinks. Restaurant employees were arrested for violating the &quot;happy hours prohibited&quot; statute. The general partner of the partnership that owned the restaurant sought a declaratory judgment that the statute did not prohibit the restaurant from conducting the ladies' buffet night. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the general partner and the court reversed. It found that the statute prohibited the selling of alcoholic liquor on any one date at a reduced priced other than that charged other purchasers of drinks on that day where such reduced price is a promotion to encourage consumption of alcoholic liquor and that the exception allowing the inclusion of drinks of alcoholic liquor as part of a meal package was not intended to be an exception to the prohibition.</SPAN></P>

After the decedent's death, she filed a claim against his estate, claiming that she was entitled to compensation for services she rendered to the decedent and for personal funds she expended for his care. The trial judge substantially limited the testimony of the sister's witnesses pursuant to respondent estate administrator's objections under the Dead Man's Act (Act), 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/8-201. After the sister's claims were denied, she contended on appeal that the trial court erred when it refused to allow her testimony as to the physical and mental condition of her brother and as to the care she provided for him. The court held that the trial court's denial of her claims was proper because the sister failed to establish her right to recovery under an implied contract theory. The court found no evidence that the decedent expected to compensate the sister beyond the payments she received as his appointed guardian.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois), which convicted defendant of perjury and sentenced defendant to five years imprisonment to be served consecutively to a sentence he was serving when the perjury was committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As part of a plea agreement, defendant testified before a grand jury regarding a codefendant's role in a criminal drug conspiracy. Defendant testified that he was a friend of the codefendant and had arranged with him to sell cocaine. When called to testify at the codefendant's trial, defendant attempted to avoid answering questions regarding the codefendant. The trial court ruled that by virtue of defendant's guilty plea, the privilege against self-incrimination was not available to him and ordered defendant to answer some nonincriminating questions. Defendant testified that he did not recall specific events that he had testified to before the grand jury nor specific answers he had given in his grand jury testimony. The trial court found defendant guilty of perjury. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that defendant was not deprived of his right against self-incrimination as there were no criminal proceedings pending against him at the time of his trial testimony. Further, his plea agreement resulted in waiver of his right against self-incrimination. Finally, the evidence was sufficient for a jury to have found that defendant's memory was selective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision from the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which found him guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), sentenced him to one year of conditional discharge, and levied a fine under the provisions of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-6-1(d) (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of DUI and given a fine and a one-year conditional discharge. He challenged the decision and argued that he was entitled to supervision because the amendment to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-6-1(d) (1993) enlarging the time limit for the consideration of past violations from 5 years to 10 years was unconstitutional. Specifically, he asserted that the statute was in conflict with 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-500 (1992), which limited supervision in summary suspension cases to offenders who had not had a violation within the past 5 years. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that no conflict existed because the summary suspension statute and the DUI statute addressed different problems. The summary suspension statute was civil in nature and not part of the punishment for DUI. Rather, it was designed to restrict limited driving privileges available to repeat offenders. The DUI statute was designed to punish violations of the law and the establishment of a longer period to preclude first offender status was appropriate. Defendant's argument that he did not have fair warning of the passage of the new amendment was without merit.</SPAN></P>

Finally, the certified records of defendant's prior convictions for armed robberies were sufficient to support the adjudication of the trial court under the Habitual Criminal Act as defendant offered no evidence other than his bare contention that he was not convicted of an armed robbery to rebut evidence of his prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm. On appeal, defendant maintained that the shooting death of the victim was accidental or at worst the product of a mere reckless act. Defendant also contended that his actions were justified on the basis of self-defense or were the result of an unreasonable belief in the need for self-defense. Finally, defendant argued that he was entitled to a new trial because he did not waive his right to a jury trial in writing as required by &sect; 115-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-1. The court found that although defendant knowingly waived his right to a jury in open court, defendant's convictions required reversal because no written waiver of a jury trial was obtained as required by para. 115-1. Further, para. 115-1 did not violate the Separation of Powers Clause of the Illinois Constitution, and defendant did not waive the issue by failing to properly preserve it for appeal because the right to a jury trial involved substantial rights. For purposes of retrial, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A judgment was entered in favor of the creditor against the debtor. The creditor filed an affidavit for nonwage garnishment with the debtor's life insurance company, and the trial court found that the creditor was entitled to half of the mutual fund account held by the company for the debtor and his wife. On review, the court found that the nonwage garnishment laws in effect at the time of the trial court's order, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-701 et seq. (1992), violated the due process guarantees of the state and federal constitutions. The court stated that the record was not sufficient to determine whether the debtor's mutual fund account was funded entirely by the accumulated cash values in two life insurance polices and thus was exempt from the creditor's attachment under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-1001(f) (1992). The court held the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 160/1 et seq. (1992), did not prohibit the debtor's reconveyance of his home from a joint tenancy to a tenancy by the entirety after the creditor's judgment was entered because the statute defining a tenancy by the entirety authorized the debtor's action, 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. 1005/1c (1992).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff administrator filed a wrongful death action against defendants, nightclub and its owner (collectively nightclub), towing company, and city, to recover for the decedent's death following a motorcycle accident. The Circuit Court of Madison County (Illinois) dismissed the complaint as to the nightclub, and entered summary judgment in favor of the towing company and the city. The administrator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administrator claimed that as a patron of the nightclub the decedent became intoxicated. As a result of his intoxicated state, he collided head-on with another vehicle and died from his injuries. The administrator argued that the nightclub's promotion was a willful and wanton violation of the Liquor Control Act (Act), 235 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/6-28(b) (1992), which prohibits happy hours. On appeal, the court determined that the only remedy available to the administrator under the Act was provided for in 235 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/6-21 (1992). The court held that no common law cause of action existed against the nightclub for willful and wanton violation of the statutory prohibition against happy hours. As to the grant of summary judgment in favor of the towing company, the court held that material issues of fact existed as to whether the motorcycle was entrusted to the decedent and if so, if the towing company's owner knew or should have known that the decedent was intoxicated. Finally, the city could not be held liable on a theory of respondeat superior for the actions of the towing company because it was an independent contractor over which the city had not control.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the dismissal for the company against the nightclub because the administrator failed to state an actionable cause of action against the nightclub. The court also affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the city; however, the court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the towing company because material issues of fact existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed a decision from the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which granted defendant's motion to suppress the results of a blood-alcohol test taken at the scene of an accident pursuant to &sect; 11-501.6(a) of the Illinois Vehicle Code, codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501.6(a) (1991) (now 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-501.6(a) (1992)), where defendant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute that authorized the blood test had been declared facially unconstitutional, and the State argued against suppression because the officer relied in &quot;good faith&quot; on the validity of the statute at the time he requested the test. The court affirmed the order of suppression, and initially noted that the Illinois Constitution afforded greater protection than the Federal Constitution. Although the United States Supreme Court recognized a limited &quot;good faith&quot; exception for a warrantless administrative search where a statute was later found to be unconstitutional, Illinois' Constitution recognized no such exception. Illinois courts have consistently refused to apply the good-faith exception in cases where no warrant was present, and a warrantless search or seizure was deemed unreasonable per se unless it came within a specific, well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement. In the absence of probable cause, a &quot;good faith&quot; reliance on a facially invalid statute could not legitimize an unconstitutional search. Absent probable cause, the invasion of the physical integrity of a person constituted an unreasonable invasion of privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs argued that the distinction in 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/10-2 between parents whose 18- to 21-year-old children lived at home and those whose children did not violated the equal protection clauses of both the United States and Illinois Constitutions. The department argued that the parents of AFDC recipients who allowed their 18- to 21-year-old children to reside at home were not similarly situated to those who did not allow their AFDC recipient children in the same age group to live in the parental home. The court held that 10-2 did not directly and substantially interfere with a family's fundamental right to live in the type of family unit that it chose. In light of the stated purposes of the statute the court however found no rational basis for distinguishing between parents whose 18- to 21-year-oldchildren lived with them and those whose children did not, in the determination of support liability. The court finally found that the invalid provision of 10-2 could not be severed from the remainder of the section under 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13-4, as the legislative history showed that it was enacted to include the exception at issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff insurer appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted defendant city's motion for summary judgment and awarded damages and legal fees in the insurer's declaratory judgment action seeking a determination of its liability to indemnify the city under a public officials and employees liability policy issued to the city for legal fees resulting from seven lawsuits filed against it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An insurer issued a public officials and employees liability policy to the city which contained exclusions for claims based on property damage and for claims based on wrongful entry or eviction. Seven lawsuits were brought against the city for engaging in a conspiracy to force minorities from the city. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city, awarded attorneys' fees on the underlying suit, damages, and attorneys' fees on the declaratory judgment action. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court affirmed all but one of the underlying cases. The court held that allegations of civil rights violations by the city did not fall within any of the policy exclusions. Each of the plaintiffs in the underlying cases would have had civil rights claims against the city based on alleged discriminatory enforcement of the building code. Only one plaintiff had a claim for eviction, which did not have civil rights violations attached. The court reversed the award of attorneys' fees on the declaratory action, holding that there was no proof the insurer acted vexatiously in bringing the suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of the Ninth Judicial Circuit Warren County, Illinois, which granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained from defendant's residence under an anticipatory search warrant and ruled that the search warrant was invalid under state law. Defendant alleged that the warrant violated the requirements in 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/108-3(a) (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The U.S. postal service contacted police when they mistakenly opened a package addressed to defendant and discovered a substance that they believed was cocaine. The substance was cocaine. Based on the police's belief that probable cause would exist after the delivery of the letter, the police obtained a search warrant for defendant's home for a time shortly after the package was to be delivered. The affidavit in support of the search warrant stated that &quot;once the contents of the letter&quot; was delivered probable cause would exist. The court affirmed the trial court's suppression of the evidence and its ruling that the warrant was invalid. The court held that anticipatory search warrants were impermissible under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/108-3(a) (1993) because that law required a prior crime for the issuance of a warrant. Moreover, the contingency for execution of the warrant was not noted in the affidavit in support of the warrant with sufficient specificity as it was not explicit, clear, and narrowly drawn so as to avoid misunderstanding or manipulation. Indeed, the affidavit was silent on the role the police would play in the actual delivery of the letter and its search operations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city appealed from the order of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) declaring invalid certain conditions which the city attached to a conditional use permit granted to plaintiff halfway house for the construction and operation of a residential rehabilitation center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The halfway house applied for a conditional use permit for the construction and operation of a residential rehabilitation center. The city denied the request, and on appeal, the trial court determined that the zoning ordinance was unreasonable and that the proposed use was reasonable. Further hearings were conducted, and the city granted the conditional use permit subject to 14 conditions. The halfway house objected to five of the conditions, and the trial court declared all but one of them invalid. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that the trial court should not have automatically declared invalid the 32-person restriction because it conflicted with a prior court order without determining whether the restriction was otherwise unreasonable, and therefore, remand on that issue was necessary. The court found that the condition prohibiting the halfway house from accepting residents who had been convicted of sexual offenses was void for vagueness because it did not set forth the standards for making that determination. Finally, the 14-day notice requirement was also invalid because there was no evidence that it was necessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the portion of the trial court's order findings that the 14-day notice period was unreasonable and that the condition prohibiting the halfway house from accepting residents who had been convicted of offenses that were of a sexual nature was vague and unenforceable. The court reversed the portion of the order invalidating the 32-person restriction and remanded for further hearings on whether the restriction was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

He filed a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-1 et seq. The trial court dismissed his motion and he appealed. Petitioner contended that his constitutional rights were violated during his direct appeal because the wrong constitutional standard was used in denying admittance of an extrajudicial third party confession, he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel and denied effective assistance of appellate counsel. The court affirmed the dismissal. First, the court held the petitioner's constitutional rights were not violated because the trial court applied the applicable standard at the time with respect to the inadmissibility of an untrustworthy extrajudicial third party confession. Secondly, the court held that dismissal was proper based upon the affidavit asserting that new evidence was discovered following the trial because the statement was not obtained with diligence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In their complaint, the employees alleged that portions of a collective-bargaining agreement (FOP contract) between defendant county and their union, and the bylaws of the merit commission violated the Sheriff's Merit System Law (Merit System Law), 55 Ill.

Moreover, the employees sought an order enjoining the sheriff's department from hiring new officers to the rank of deputy sheriff or, alternatively, an order directing the department to pay the employees at the rate earned by the deputy sheriffs. In its motion to dismiss, the county argued that the employees waived their right to contest them merit commission's promotion system by virtue of their participation in the FOP contract, which acknowledged that the merit commission had sole authority over promotions. The court held that the merit commission could not maintain, either by rule or practice, a dual entry level. Therefore, the court reversed and remanded the trial court's decision to dismiss the employees' action holding that the employees pleaded sufficient facts to indicate that they had been systematically denied rights available to others within the merit system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff litigants appealed a ruling of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed their class action against defendant clerk that sought a declaration that &sect; 27.2a(k)(5) of the Clerks of Court Act (Act), 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 105/27.2a(k)(5) was unconstitutional, to recover fees paid under the Act, and a temporary restraining order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The litigants complained that the required fees for reproduction of documents by the clerk as mandated by the Act were unconstitutional because it violated the free access to justice clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, &sect; 12 and the due process clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The litigants initially applied for a temporary restraining order to enjoin the clerk from charging the fees, which was denied, so they filed an amended class action complaint, which the circuit court dismissed pursuant to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-615. The court affirmed on appeal. The court rejected the litigants' assertion that 105/27.2a(k)(5) imposed a duty upon the clerk to provide the reproduction services, thus the clerk was properly following the costs laid out in the statute. The fees were only charged to those who requested the specific service of reproduction, rather than to raise general revenue, thus, there was not a chilling effect on those who sought access to the courts, and the fees were not in violation of the free access to justice clause of the Illinois Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the dismissal of the litigants' class action against the clerk, which sought a declaration that a provision of the Clerks of Court Act was unconstitutional and a temporary restraining order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother sought interlocutory review of an order from the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), seeking to vacate a gag order which prohibited the mother, her attorneys, appellee father, and his attorneys from discussing the facts in the underlying child neglect proceeding with members of the news media.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the mother asserted that the gag order (1) violated her constitutional right to free speech, (2) was an unnecessary injunctive restraint on speech in that less-restrictive alternatives existed, and (3) was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. Finding no merit in any of the assignments of error, the court affirmed. While there was a strong presumption against the validity of prior restraints upon free speech, the danger of public disclosure and probability of irreparable adverse effects upon the child constituted a compelling state interest against such disclosure. The record indicated that the child had suffered emotional trauma because of the strife between the parents; airing that strife in the media only would have exacerbated the problem and would have constituted an egregious invasion of the child's privacy. Such interests outweighed the mother's right to take her case to the press. The court concluded by rejecting the notion that the gag order failed constitutional overbreadth and vagueness standards, particularly where a person of ordinary intelligence could read the gag order to forbid exactly what the mother wanted to do.</SPAN></P>

On appeal of the lower court's dismissal of the action, the court found that the action, although seeking injunctive relief, was based on contract and, thus, was barred by 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 505/8(b) (1992), which required such claims to be brought in the court of claims. The court ruled that the partnerships' use of words such as &quot;wrongful&quot; were mere conclusions that could not place what was otherwise a contract action against the state within an exception to the bar of sovereign immunity. The court did find that the disqualification of the partnerships' counsel was erroneous because the attorneys' prior representation was not &quot;substantially related&quot; to the litigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the partnerships' action in the circuit court, but the court reversed the disqualification of the partnerships' attorneys.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff county initiated two administrative citation procedures with the Illinois Pollution Control Board (board) against defendant property owner. The board found that the property owner used his property as an open dump resulting in the occurrence of litter, and imposed a $ 500 penalty and ordered him to pay the costs of the hearing process which, by separate order, were assessed at $ 952.25. The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A county health inspector filed an administrative citation, alleging that the property owner caused or allowed open dumping on his property, resulting in the occurrence of litter. The property owner contested the citation, and a hearing was held. The board entered an order bifurcating the proceedings, assigning a portion of the proceedings to &quot;Docket A&quot; and another portion to &quot;Docket B.&quot; The board found that the property owner committed the violation, assessed a $ 500 penalty, and ordered him to pay the hearing costs which would later be assessed in the &quot;Docket B&quot; proceedings. The board contended that the court did not have jurisdiction to consider the arguments raised by the property owner's first appeal as the notice of appeal was not timely filed. The court found that the appeal was actually premature because the first order was not final. The court held that the board did not have the authority, on bifurcating the administrative citation proceedings, to purport to make the first (as well as the second) order &quot;final&quot; for purposes of appeal. The court held, however, that the improper bifurcation of the proceedings did not render the order assessing costs void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the property owner did violate the Act, but that the board abused its discretion in assessing costs of $ 952.25.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant cabinet manufacturer appealed from the order of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which entered summary judgment in favor of plaintiff cabinet retailer and awarded compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorney's fees in the retailer's action against the manufacturer for commissions earned after a unilateral termination of the sales contract between the parties by the manufacturer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The manufacturer terminated the sales agreement with the retailer when the retailer began to carry the goods of another manufacturer. The manufacturer perceived the second manufacturer to be a competitor, and that the retailer's sale of the second manufacturer's products was in violation of the contract. According to the retailer's interpretation, the second manufacturer was not a competitor under the contract because of the price differences between the products. The court held that the choice of forum clause in the contract, requiring an action to be brought in Texas, was void against the public policy of the state to protect sales representatives. The choice of law forum was also voided to avoid the absurd result of applying Texas state law after the determination that Illinois policy required the dispute to be litigated in Illinois. The court held that the issue of whether the second manufacturer was a competitor of defendant manufacturer was a genuine issue of fact needed to be resolved at trial; therefore, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the retailer. Accordingly, the award of punitive damages and attorney's fees was also error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the cause was remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, 37 school districts, 11 parents, 11 students, and an interest group, sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed their action against defendants, governor, board of education, and education superintendent, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Illinois School Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 1-1 et seq. (1989), violated the Illinois Constitution of 1970.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs' challenged the way public education was financed in Illinois. The trial court dismissed their complaint for failure to state a cause of action. On appeal, plaintiffs argued that Illinois' statutory scheme for financing public education violated Ill. Const. art. X, &sect; 1 (1970), the education article, and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1970), the equal protection clause. Plaintiffs also challenged the constitutionality of the statutory scheme applied to economically disadvantaged students. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action that the method chosen by the legislature to finance public schools violated the education article of the Illinois Constitution. The allegation that certain educational resources were unavailable in poorer school districts, or inferior to those in wealthier districts, did not compel the conclusion that the funding provided by Illinois' financing system was insufficient to provide an adequate education. Illinois' school financing scheme was rationally related to the goal of local control, which was a legitimate state purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-10-1 (1992) granted the municipalities the authority to impose a tax on certain fire insurance policies on property located within the municipality. A prior version of the statute gave the municipalities the option of distributing the money to the local fire department or donating it to a qualified fireman's pension fund. The statute was amended to remove the latter option. Plaintiffs alleged that the municipalities were continuing to deposit the money collected in the pension funds. The municipalities argued that the amendment was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court decision in favor of plaintiffs. The court found that the restrictions placed on the municipalities by the amendment did not violate home rule. Home rule municipalities had no authority to levy taxes against insurance companies. Section 5/11-10 was therefore an exceptional grant of power that could be limited as the legislature saw fit. The court also found that the amendment was not unconstitutional merely because it exempted Chicago from the statute because population classifications distinguishing Chicago from the rest of the state had long been presumed valid.</SPAN></P>

The state refiled the homicide counts and the three original citations for DUI and leaving the scene of an accident after the misdemeanor statute of limitations had expired. The trial court entered the jury's convictions for three reckless homicides and leaving the scene of an accident, but not the DUI convictions. On appeal, the court affirmed. The traffic offenses were properly charged and presented to the jury because the misdemeanor statute of limitations was tolled during the pendency of the homicide cases, the charges arose out of the same conduct alleged in the homicide cases, and the amendments did not change the substance of the original charges. The trial court properly granted the state's unopposed motion to nol-pros.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant manufacturers filed an interlocutory appeal in plaintiff medical center's action for property damage after the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) certified the question of whether the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13-214(b), applied to an action against an entity, which designed and/or manufactured, but did not install, a material or product, which was used in a building during construction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The medical center filed an action against the manufacturers alleging property damage from the integration of the manufactures' asbestos-containing products into its medical buildings. The manufacturers filed a motion to dismiss the complaint interposing a defense under &sect; 13-214(b) of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13-214(b), which the trial court granted and then reversed. Subsequently, the court granted manufacturers' motion for interlocutory appeal certifying the question of whether &sect; 13-214(b) applied to an action against an entity which designed and/or manufactured, but did not install, a material or product which was used in a building during construction. The court held that in order to be afforded the benefit of &sect; 13-214(b), a manufacturer must have performed some role related to the construction beyond furnishing standard products generally available to the public and not custom designed for the project.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court answered the question in the negative and remanded the case with instructions for the trial court to examine the relationship between the manufacturers' products and the construction to determine whether their products were generic or mass-produced for public consumption. If the manufacturers' products were for public consumption, they would have been outside the protection of section 13-214(b), 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13-214(b).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer cross-appealed seeking dismissal of the claim for workers' compensation benefits on constitutional and statutory grounds. The court affirmed and held that the award of permanent partial disability was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court ruled that the employee's claim was not barred under &sect; 6(c) of the Act because the employee's coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) was governed by the five-year statute of limitations which was obviously intended to supplant the three-year filing requirement preceding it in section 6(c) of the Act. The court found that the amendment in &sect; 6(c) of the Act included a special filing time for CWP based on the date of the last exposure. The court also upheld the constitutionality of the Act. The court concluded that the commission's decision was not against the manifest weight of the evidence because it was reasonably inferred from the record that employee's present state of health would not have totally prevented him from seeking other employment upon his retirement and that given his education and previous work experience there would have been a reasonably stable market for his services.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the revocation in part, holding that the abandonment charge was not supported by sufficient evidence in that no expert testimony was presented to support the charge. The court affirmed the revocation in part, holding that the findings regarding the remaining charges were correct; the Act did not violate the separation of powers or due process provisions of the Illinois Constitution; the presence of television cameras during the administrative hearing did not deprive the physician of due process; and the trial court correctly ruled that it did not have the power to reduce the sanction imposed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city employee borrowed money from the credit union and executed a power of attorney permitting the credit union to collect any balance due from amounts to be refunded to him at the time of his separation from the city.

The employee filed suit alleging that the credit union's and retirement fund's actions were contrary to &sect; 8-244 of the Illinois Pension Code. The trial court entered summary judgment for the credit union, retirement fund, and the fund's trustees. On appeal, the court affirmed. A prior case interpreting &sect; 8-244 did not collaterally estop the court from independently interpreting the section because in the prior case the judge decided an unmixed question of law. The court affirmed the trial court's determination that &sect; 8-244, even before its 1991 amendment, permitted assignments of refunds.

The court held as to one defendant that he was not arrested without probable cause because he was implicated by the accomplice, who described defendant's actions and was found to be reliable. The court held as to the other defendant that while a witness' prior inconsistent statement was erroneously admitted as substantive rather than impeaching evidence, such error was harmless in light of the ample evidence of defendant's guilt. As to both defendants, the court held that witness testimony that defendants were gang members was admissible because it provided a motive for an otherwise inexplicable act.

The court rejected defendant's argument that the bodily injury the victim suffered was inherent in offense of criminal sexual assault and should not have served as an aggravating factor of bodily harm. The court reasoned that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial that enabled the trial court to conclude that the victim suffered bodily harm other than that inherent in the offense. The evidence included the victim's testimony that it hurt when defendant's penis touched her vagina, and the medical evidence indicating a perforated hymen, absent hymenal ring, and &quot;old&quot; blood in the vagina, and ecchymotic or dark purple in two areas of the vagina. The court held that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing defendant to concurrent rather than the consecutive terms of imprisonment required under Ill. Code Civ. P., 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4(a). The court affirmed the sentencing however, holding that ordering the trial court to impose consecutive sentences might have been a prohibited expansion of the State's limited right to appeal in a criminal case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff physician brought an administrative review action against defendant Illinois Department of Professional Regulation (department) to contest the denial of his request for subpoenas pursuant to Ill. Admin. Code tit. 68, &sect; 1110.140 (Supp. 1988). The physician sought a declaratory judgment that the provision was void on its face and as applied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The physician was charged with violating the Medical Practice Act of 1987 (Medical Malpractice Act), Ill. Rev.

The court held that the physician did not meet the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine because the exception was invoked only in cases involving an extraordinary degree of public concern and only where the public interest was very clear.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the landowners' use of the term &quot;continuous&quot; to describe the state of flooding on their property was arguably imprecise and misleading; (2) there was no evidence that the flooding caused a permanent accumulation of water on the landowners' property; (3) the landowners showed no actual physical invasion of their property, which deprived them of the use of the land; (4) there was no evidence that the property was a &quot;retention site&quot; because the water was not permanent; and (5) the undisputed facts showed that no taking occurred.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the forfeiture was an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The court reversed the trial court's ruling, which ordered the forfeiture of defendant's car. The court noted that in rem civil forfeiture was punishment for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. Some degree of nexus between the property and the commission of the offense was required to permit forfeiture. The court remanded the case to the trial court for the trial court to consider various factors such as the extent to which the car facilitated the offenses, examination of the value of the property, and examination of the relative seriousness of the offense. The fact that defendant was 69 years old and cared for his retarded son were additional factors to consider.</SPAN></P>

Where such evidence existed, the trial court could not weigh the evidence in deciding whether an issue had been raised entitling defendant to the instruction. In addition, the aggravated battery statute was not unconstitutional when the legislature mandated a harsher sentence to those who used forearms in the commission of a crime because the frequency of a crime and the high risk of bodily harm associated with a crime could also be considered in determining the seriousness of the offense.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 705/14.14, following denial of its post-judgment motion, arguing that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The non-home-rule village sought to disconnect certain territory of the objecting fire district and transfer it to respondent district, relying on the disconnection provisions of &sect; 14.4 of the Act. The objecting district argued that the Act was unconstitutional as a special or local law applying only to a county with a population of half to three-quarters of a million. It tried unsuccessfully to have the petition dismissed under &sect; 2-619(a)(9) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-619(a)(9). The circuit court concluded the statute was constitutional and the objector's arguments were moot. It granted the petition. The district argued the classification limiting application based on population was arbitrary and did not bear a rational and proper relation to the evil to be remedied. The court reversed, holding &sect; 14.4 unconstitutional, agreeing with the objecting district that the Act was special legislation and the limiting classification was arbitrary. There was no relationship between county population and the need for municipalities to consolidate fire protection districts or any indication that one county was distinct from any other for purposes of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment for the village, transferring fire district territory to another district, was reversed and remanded with directions, because the relevant statutory section violated the state constitution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a petition to adjudicate a wife as disabled was filed, the disabled person filed a petition to appoint her husband as guardian. Appellant husband sought review of the order of the Circuit Court Kankakee County (Illinois) dismissing the wife's petition pursuant to 755 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11a-5(a) (1992), which precluded convicted felons from acting as guardians, and appointing appellee daughter as guardian.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife filed a petition to have her husband appointed as her guardian, but the petition was denied due to the husband's felony conviction. The court held that the motivation of the General Assembly in enacting 755 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11a-5(a) (1992) was to protect the vulnerable. This was in accord with the paramount concern surrounding the selection of a guardian which was in the best interest and well-being of the incompetent. The bill of attainder clause was not violated and the court found no ex post facto violation. However, the court found that &sect; 5/11a-5(a), although constitutional, could have been unconstitutionally applied to the husband. It could have been found that there was no rational basis for treating a person with a 36-year old felony conviction differently from any other husband of 43 years who sought to be appointed as his wife's guardian upon her becoming disabled. The court held that if on remand the husband proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he was fit and that his appointment would have served the wife's best interests, it would find that the law was unconstitutionally applied and would give due consideration to the wife's choice of a guardian.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment dismissing the wife's petition to have her husband appointed as her guardian and remanded the cause for a hearing to determine if the husband's appointment would serve the best interests and welfare of the wife.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to burglary and violation of bail bond. He was sentenced to one years' probation and six months' imprisonment. During the probationary term, the State filed a petition to revoke defendant's probation for failure to report to his probation officer. Several months later, a hearing was conducted on the petition, and defendant was sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment. A few weeks later, defendant was arrested for participation in a robbery. After defendant's probationary term expired, the State filed a second petition for revocation of defendant's probation based on the arrest. The trial court later granted the petition and revoked defendant's probation, sentencing him to concurrent prison terms for burglary and violation of bail bond. On appeal, the court held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to rule on the State's petition because it was filed after the expiration of defendant's probationary term. The court also held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-6-4(a)(3) (1991) did not extend defendant's probationary term by the amount of the period tolled for the first revocation proceeding, which was commenced and completed within the probationary term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the rulings of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of criminal sexual assault, robbery, and unlawful restraint. The trial court held that the rape shield statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-7 (1991), did not allow defendant to present evidence of the victim's alleged history of trading sexual favors for drugs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court held that defendant had not shown the extraordinary circumstances needed to meet the &quot;prior pattern exception&quot; to the rape shield statute because there was no showing of distinctive characteristics or a modus operandi, and defendant was allowed to present his theory of defense by other means. The court held that defendant's right of confrontation was not violated by restrictions on his cross-examination of the victim because the entire record showed that the jury was made aware of many factors concerning relevant areas of impeachment through testimony as to her history of drugs and alcohol and testimony related to possible consent. The court also found that an acquittal of aggravated criminal sexual assault was not an inconsistent verdict because the evidence showed a time lag between the sexual assault and the taking of jewelry. The court found that a prosecutor's comments were based on the evidence, not personal opinion, and that any possible error from a reference to another case was cured by the prompt ruling of the trial court and an admonition to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owners sought injunctive and declaratory relief against defendants, a village, a landowner and a bank, alleging, inter alia, the invalidity of the rezoning granted to the land owner by the village. The Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) found the rezoning unconstitutional, but found for the village and the landowner in all other respects. The village and the landowner appealed and the property owners cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village rezoned a parcel purchased from the bank by the landowner to a residential development, despite the property owner's opposition, whose hotel and golf course were adjacent to the parcel. The trial court found the rezoning unconstitutional because combining the proposed residential use with the hotel and golf course would have a negative effect on public health, safety, and welfare, but granted summary judgment to the landowner on the property owners' claim for sum owed on an easement. The trial court also dismissed the bank's counterclaim that alleged that the rezoning was valid. The village and the landowner argued that the trial court erred in finding the rezoning unconstitutional by not looking beyond the hotel and the golf course. The property owners argued that the trial court misconstrued the easement agreement. The bank argued that it had standing to bring its counterclaim. The court held that there was sufficient evidence for the trial court's finding that the rezoning was unconstitutional and that the trial court incorrectly found that the property owners had no lien pursuant to the easement agreement. The dismissal of the bank's counterclaim was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in all respects the trial court's decision, which declared the rezoning unconstitutional, but reversed the order that granted summary judgment to the landowner on the reimbursement due to plaintiffs and remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings. The court further affirmed the trial court's order, which dismissed the bank's counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

The court held a hearing in which the mother was absent, found that a parent-child relationship existed, and awarded custody to the father.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three attempts to effect service of process upon the father resulted in the sheriff's return of &quot;not found.&quot; He was finally served with summons and a hearing was set. The state's attorney sent notice of the hearing to the mother, but she contended that she never received it. The father admitted paternity asked for custody of the child. The mother argued that the trial court's ruling awarding custody to the father was void because the issue of custody was not properly before the court. The parentage petition was not directed at custody. The court held that the trial court erred when it entered the custody order because its authority to decide the custody issue was not activated through the proper procedural mechanism. The only justiciable questions raised by the petition were the establishment of a parent/child relationship between the child and the father and his support obligation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered a return to the status quo ante by vacation of the custody order and reinstatement of custody of the child with the mother.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of criminal sexual assault and aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

The court found that the trial court did not give due consideration to the girl's maturity and understanding, notwithstanding a showing by defendant that she possessed a level of sophistication exceeding that of others her age, did not inquire as to why or to what degree the complainant felt uncomfortable in the presence of defendant's parents, and failed to consider whether reasonable alternatives to closure were available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The passenger alleged that the bus driver's negligence injured her as she stepped off a moving bus. Her action was filed one year after the injury, and the passenger claimed to have notified the transit authority's general attorney within six months after the accident. The lower court dismissed the passenger's action because she failed to comply with &sect; 341, and the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 341 was to be strictly construed and that it required that notice be given to both the transit authority's general attorney and its secretary. Because the passenger failed to notify the secretary, her action against it failed. The court ruled that even though the six month notice requirement of &sect; 341 was shorter than the one year notification requirement contained in the Tort Immunity Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 85, para. 8-101 (1991), the six-month notification requirement did not violate the passenger's equal protection rights because the transit authority was so large that it performed unique functions which justified differences between its liability and the liability imposed on other entities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While in prison, defendant sought out the services of a fellow inmate's gang buddies to arrange the murder of his daughter's boyfriend. The inmate informed police who sent an undercover cop to arrange the details of the hit with defendant. Defendant at first requested only that the boyfriend be injured, but after repeated prodding by the undercover officer, admitted he wouldn't mind if the boyfriend were killed. Defendant was convicted of solicitation of murder. The court found that there was sufficient evidence for the trial court to find that defendant was predisposed to commit the offence of solicitation of murder rather than solicitation of aggravated battery and that defendant was not entrapped. The court also found that the mere fact that the crime of solicitation of murder carried a harsher penalty than other felonies in the same class did not mean that defendant could not be sentenced to an extended prison term under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-1. Finally, the court found that the trial court erred in considering the threat of serious harm as an aggravating factor in sentencing because that factor was part of the crime charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for solicitation of murder but vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 5/4-105 (1992). Defendant appealed, claiming the Anti-Theft Laws of the vehicle code, of which &sect; 4-105 was a part, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested after a police officer encountered the vehicle he was riding in, which had a counterfeit temporary registration permit in its back window. When questioned about the counterfeit permit, defendant told the officer that he made it. At trial, the parties stipulated that the records of the Illinois Secretary of State showed that the vehicle in question was registered to a codefendant. On appeal, defendant claimed that he owned the vehicle and based on precedent of the Illinois Supreme Court, that his conviction violated due process. Though the court rejected the State's claim that the issue was waived because it was not raised at trial, emphasizing that constitutional challenges to legislation could be raised at any time, it affirmed the judgment. In doing so, the court ruled that because the parties had stipulated at trial that a codefendant owned the vehicle, no evidence on the issue of ownership was presented. Given that, the record was not sufficiently developed to rule on the question of ownership, and because defendant's ownership of the car was an essential element to the success of his appeal, it necessarily failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant non-profit corporation, which owned and operated an amusement park within the corporate limits of appellee village, filed suit for a declaratory judgment that an amusement tax enacted by the village was unconstitutional and void. The non-profit corporation challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) denying its request for a preliminary injunction that would prevent the enforcement or collection of the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue presented on appeal was whether the non-profit corporation raised a fair question of whether the amusement tax violated equal protection, the requirement of uniformity of taxation, Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 265 (1970), or the prohibition on impermissible special assessments, 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-2-45. The court held that the trial court's denial of the requested relief was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The trial court had sufficient grounds to conclude that non-profit corporation had not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits. The court found that the amusement tax offended neither uniformity nor equal protection as it was directed against customers rather than against the non-profit corporation. In rejecting the non-profit corporation's argument that the burden of the tax was disproportionate to the benefit it received, the court also found that the ordinance imposed a general revenue tax for the benefit of the village as a whole. The court concluded that the amusement ordinance could not be considered a special assessment because it was never designed to exact a charge in return for a particular benefit to a specific property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court denying the non-profit corporation its prayer for preliminary injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for the offense of reckless homicide. He was involved in a single-car accident in which his passenger was fatally injured. Later, at the hospital, police requested that defendant submit to a blood-alcohol concentration test under 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 11-501.6 (1992). Defendant agreed and when blood was taken he was not under arrest. The trial court allowed defendant's motion to suppress on the basis that the statute had been declared unconstitutional. The state contended, on appeal, that probable cause existed to conduct a warrantless and nonconsensual search or test of defendant independent of the statute, regardless of the officer's belief that there was no probable cause to test the defendant. The court held that there had to be particularized probable cause to believe defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol or a drug before he could be tested without violating the constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. Here, the officer's testimony showed that defendant was not intoxicated at the time of the accident. Defendant had none of the customary indicia of intoxication and was not arrested at the time of the accident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of armed violence, aggravated unlawful restraint, unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, aggravated assault, and unlawful violation of an order of protection after he forced his way into his ex-wife's car while holding a sawed off shotgun and forced her to driven them to a park. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed in part and vacated in part. Defendant contended that the armed violence charge and the aggravated unlawful restraint charge were identical offenses and disproportionate. The court disagreed. A person could commit aggravated unlawful restraint by using a deadly weapon rather than a dangerous weapon and not simultaneously commit armed violent. Thus, allowing unlawful restraint to be used as the predicate offense for armed violence did not nullify the aggravated unlawful restraint charge. The court found that the charge for aggravated assault arose out of the same single physical act as the aggravated unlawful restraint and therefore was an improper multiple conviction. The court therefore vacated the aggravated assault charge.</SPAN></P>

The property owner built a new porch that encroached on the minimum setback, and the Board denied a variance. The property owner argued that the variance would keep much of the snow and ice from falling on the sidewalks used by his tenants. The Board found that there were no special conditions or circumstances peculiar to the building and that the property owner would not be deprived of rights enjoyed by other property owners if the variance was denied. The court concluded that the Board's decision was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court held that the language of Carbondale, Ill., Revised Code &sect; 15-2-102 (1990) was not unconstitutionally vague because &sect; 15-2-102(B) served as a sufficient guide to ascertaining whether a variance could be granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant forced the complainants into his vehicle at gunpoint and drove them to an alley where he forced them to engage in oral sex and sexual intercourse with him. Defendant was convicted and sentenced. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. The court held that defendant's consecutive sentences for aggravated criminal sexual assault under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4(a) did not violate the due process or equal protection clauses of the United State Constitution because there was a reasonable basis for denying those guilty of sexual assault the benefits of concurrent sentencing under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4(b) (1992). Further, &sect; 5/5-8-4(a) did not violate the due process or disproportionate penalty clauses of the Illinois Constitution of 1970. Defendant committed four distinct acts of aggravated criminal sexual assault on the complainants, and thus, his sentence was proportionate to his acts. However, while 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 5/5-8-4 was not unconstitutionally vague, it contained ambiguities when applied to certain factual settings because it did not expressly indicated which sentences were required to run consecutively.</SPAN></P>

These were the facts upon which the trial court based defendant's stalking conviction and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that defendant's threatening words were intended to place his wife in reasonable apprehension for her safety and that such acts were &quot;in furtherance&quot; of a threat of violence even where the acts did not result in violence and even where defendant might not have intended violence to result from the act. The court also found that the taping of the house and the cars near the house could be considered surveillance as the stalking statute used that term.</SPAN></P>

The licensee appealed on the grounds including that &sect; 6-28 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The violations stemmed from promotions in which women received unlimited alcoholic beverages at a nominal price, and patrons were encouraged to sit in a barber chair, receive multiple shots of liquor, and received a T-shirt. The circuit court affirmed the commission's decision suspending the licensee's liquor license for 30 days. On appeal, the court held that the licensee met its burden of demonstrating the invalidity of &sect; 6-28 of the Act, 235 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 5/6-28(b)(5) (1992). The statute prohibited retail licensees from encouraging or permitting any &quot;game or contest&quot; that involved drinking alcoholic liquor. The court held that &sect; 6-28 of the Act was vague and uncertain and was unconstitutional in that it violated the due process rights of those it is intended to regulate. Persons of ordinary intelligence, upon reading the statute, would not know what they could or could not do to avoid violating its provisions. The court noted that the broad interpretation of the Act as advocated on behalf of the commission would preclude taverns from permitting patrons to watch the Super Bowl on television or allow customers to play foosball.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the circuit court's judgment and vacated the 30-day suspension of the licensee's liquor license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury trial, the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicted defendant of armed robbery, kidnapping, aggravated kidnapping, and aggravated battery. On a prior appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentence but remanded the case for a Batson hearing. Defendant appealed the trial court's determination that he did not make out a prima facie case of racial discrimination under Batson.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Six of the seven potential jurors excused by the state were African-Americans, and six of the seven were women. The court affirmed the trial court's finding that defendant failed to make out a prima facie case of racial discrimination under Batson. The court held that: 1) six of nine African-American venirepersons did not constitute a pattern of strikes; 2) the prosecutor's statements did not evidence an intent to discriminate; 3) the excluded venire members shared a common characteristic, being unmarried, besides being of the same race; 4) the percentage difference in the level of African-American representation in the venire as compared to the jury was only slight evidence of discriminatory intent; and 5) because both the victim and defendant were black, their racial characteristics did not warrant an inference of discrimination. Although defendant had waived his claim of gender-based discrimination in the use of peremptory challenges, the issue was reviewable under the plain error rule. The court held that Batson applied to gender-based discrimination under both Batson and the Illinois Constitution. Thus, the court remanded the action for a Batson hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's determination that defendant failed to present a prima facie case of racial discrimination under Batson. However, the court remanded the cause to the trial court to conduct a Batson hearing in order to determine whether the state improperly exercised its peremptory challenges to exclude women from the petit jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Pope County (Illinois), which dismissed a charge of armed violence against defendant after a jury found him guilty of aggravated battery. A mistrial was declared concerning the armed violence and attempted first-degree murder charges. The court's dismissal of the armed violence charge was based on its reasoning that aggravated battery was a lesser included offense of armed violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot a man and was charged with armed violence and aggravated battery. The jury was instructed that defendant could be found guilty of either, and the court later clarified that if the jury found defendant guilty only of aggravated battery, it should select only that form and sign it. The jury found defendant guilty of aggravated battery. The court declared a mistrial concerning the armed violence charge. Defendant filed a motion to have the court dismiss the latter charge. At first, the court denied the motion, and then dismissed the charge for armed violence reasoning that jeopardy had attached. The court affirmed holding that the double jeopardy clauses of the United States Constitution and Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, &sect; 10, provided that no person could be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense. The court ruled that there was an implied acquittal of an offense where there was a guilty verdict on a lesser offense and silence as to the charged offense. The court concluded that aggravated battery was a lesser-included offense of armed violence, and therefore affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee mother was 35 weeks pregnant. Medical doctors determined that the fetus was not receiving an adequate amount of oxygen. After the mother refused to undergo a cesarean section or to have labor induced, the state filed a petition for adjudication of wardship of the fetus, seeking to invoke jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court Act, 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/1-1 et seq. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the issue was whether an Illinois court could balance whatever rights a fetus may have had against the rights of a competent woman to refuse medical advice to obtain a cesarean section for the supposed benefit of her fetus. The state argued that the circuit court should have balanced the rights of the unborn, but viable fetus which was nearly at full term and which, if the uncontradicted expert testimony of the physicians had been accurate, would have been born dead or severely retarded if the mother delivered vaginally, against the right of the competent women to choose the type of medical care she deemed appropriate, based in part on personal religious considerations. After consideration, this court held that no such balancing should have been employed, and that a woman's competent choice to refuse medical treatment as invasive as a cesarean section during pregnancy had to be honored, even in circumstances where the choice could have been harmful to her fetus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the circuit court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. Defendant argued that the state failed to prove his intent to deliver, that the circuit court erroneously failed to provide the jury with a transcript of defendant's testimony, and that he was denied a fair trial by the prosecutor's actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested when an officer chased a fleeing suspect into a room where defendant was filling packets with cocaine. Defendant was indicted. Over contradictory testimony, defendant testified that he did not have a shotgun next to him when the police arrived. A jury convicted defendant of unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. Defendant appealed, and the court held that the state failed to prove the element of intent to deliver, but it did prove all the elements of unlawful possession. Accordingly, the court reduced defendant's conviction to unlawful possession of a controlled substance and vacated defendant's sentence, remanding for a new sentencing hearing. Evidence of intent to deliver was not proved. Defendant was not found possessing a combination of narcotics or any significant amount of money that could lead to an inference of such intent. No scales for weighing the narcotics were found. An amount of 5.5 grams of cocaine, by itself, did not give rise to an inference of intent to deliver. Questioning on the shotgun was irrelevant and inadmissible, but the error was not prejudicial, so defendant was not denied a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff medical laboratory appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which denied a motion for reconsideration after the trial court held it had no power to review a decision of the court of claims and held in favor of defendants, the court of claims, the Department of Public Aid, and the Director of the Department of Public Aid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The laboratory brought suit against defendants for unpaid invoices and instituted the action in the court of claims, which had exclusive jurisdiction of all claims against the state. The court of claims ordered payment of the invoices, but denied motions by the laboratory for pre-award interest and attorneys fees. The laboratory then filed a complaint in the trial court seeking a declaratory judgment, a writ of mandamus, and a writ of certiorari to compel the defendants, including the court of claims, to order payment of the interest and fees under the Prompt Payment Act, 30 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 540/1 et seq. (1992). On appeal, the court held that sovereign immunity barred the action against the defendants outside the court of claims because the laboratory failed to prove that the state's actions were in violation of statutory law since the provisions relied on by the laboratory were not retroactive. Thus, since the laboratory failed to show a clear right to relief, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not issuing a writ of mandamus. Likewise, a writ of certiorari was inappropriate where the trial court lacked jurisdiction to review decisions of the court of claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court dismissing the action because it was without jurisdiction to review the merits of a court of claims decision denying an award of interest and fees on a judgment in favor of the laboratory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's truck struck another vehicle, killing the sole occupant who was a wife and mother of three children. Defendant smelled of alcohol, his speech was unintelligible, and he failed sobriety tests. Defendant challenged his 10-year sentence for reckless homicide. He contended that the sentence constituted an impermissible double enhancement and resulted from the trial court's consideration of improper factors and bias. On appeal, the court affirmed his sentence. The statutorily mandated sentence for reckless homicide committed while under the influence of alcohol did not constitute impermissible double enhancement. The court concluded that the trial court properly considered appropriate factors in mitigation and aggravation. While the trial court noted the type and size of the vehicles, it did not appear to give undue weight to these factors. The trial court also recognized defendant's prior convictions for DUI and his problems with alcohol abuse. This was not improper and was not to be interpreted as bias since a defendant's demonstrated history of alcoholism was a factor to be considered in the sentencing determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, an airline and associated entities, challenged the trial court's order granting a motion for voluntary dismissal of 23 consolidated cases arising from the crash of an aircraft filed by plaintiffs to avoid discovery deadlines and cut-offs. The court ruled that plaintiffs had a right to voluntary dismiss the cases pursuant to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-1009(a) (1992), as neither the supreme court nor legislature had identified discovery abuse as a basis for restricting the right to nonsuit. The court also ruled that the separation-of-powers clause of Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 was not violated because the voluntary dismissal statute, as applied, did not conflict with the supervisory authority of the supreme court, and ruled that plaintiffs were neither estopped from seeking, nor did they waive their right to seek, voluntary dismissal based on a statement of their lead counsel that they would not dismiss the case. The court determined that the trial court erred in refusing to hear and decide two motions for summary judgment filed prior to the motion for voluntary dismissal because it had discretion to hear dispositive motions that did not affect all parties and claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff insured claimants filed actions against defendant insurer for breach of contract for refusing to make payment upon plaintiffs' underinsured motorist coverage claims. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendant on both claims, and the court affirmed the orders. The court held that the underinsured motorist coverage statute provided for reduction-type coverage, which put plaintiffs in the same position they would have occupied had the tortfeasor's liability insurance limits been the same as the underinsured motorist coverage limits purchased by plaintiffs. The court held that because the tortfeasor's liability insurance limits exceeded the underinsured motorist coverage limits the underinsured motorist coverage was inapplicable. The court held that the test for the equal protection violation was not whether plaintiffs suffered a hardship, but whether the statute treated similarly situated groups of persons equally, which the court found that it did. The court held that the statute did not violate due process or equal protection under the law. The court held plaintiffs had no viable claim for improper claims practice or breach of any duty to deal in good faith.</SPAN></P>

Summary judgment was entered in favor of the dealership, and the court affirmed on appeal. The dealership was not &quot;selling&quot; or &quot;dealing&quot; in new cars in Illinois. The display was simply an advertisement, and therefore, the dealership was not required to obtain a license of permit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant stopped his car in traffic and made the rear tires screech, while a state trooper watched. Defendant said his foot slipped off the clutch. Defendant claimed that the language of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-505 (1991), prohibiting squealing and screeching of tires, pertained only to a moving vehicle. He based this conclusion on the section's placement within the Vehicle Code following the offenses of reckless driving and drag racing and preceding the general speed restrictions, which he argued showed a legislative intent to prohibit hazardous speeds and movement of vehicles, rather than merely noise. He also claimed that rapid acceleration or excessive speed around corners referred only to a moving vehicle. In response to defendant's motion for a directed verdict, the trial court concluded that the language &quot;rapid acceleration&quot; applied to acceleration of the engine and the tires, as well as the vehicle. The court concluded that rapid acceleration that caused squealing or screeching of tires did not require any movement of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute and the sufficiency of the evidence, and she contended that the complaint was insufficiently drafted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested after she was found holding a knife to her baby's throat, screaming that she had to kill the baby. The baby was unharmed. The appellate court affirmed. The sufficiency of a complaint was judged according to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 5/111-3 (1992). Mere technical violations were disregarded. The complaint was judged according to its plain and ordinary meaning. The complaint was sufficiently drafted to apprise defendant of the conduct and charges for which she could prepare a defense. Evidence of the child's age and the fact that defendant had her care was admitted. Actual physical harm was not required for a conviction under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 150/4 (1992). Endangering a child meant placing her in danger of probable harm. Any contradictions in the police officers' testimony went to credibility, which was for the trier of fact. Section 150/4 was not void for vagueness. The fact that there could have been borderline cases where a person was convicted for disciplining a child harshly did not render the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an interlocutory appeal, defendant health plan foundation challenged an order from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which denied the foundation's motion to dismiss plaintiff estate administrator's complaint alleging medical malpractice. The foundation based its motion on the Voluntary Health Services Plans Act (VHSPA), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 32, para. 620 (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administrator brought a medical malpractice action against the foundation on behalf of the estate of the deceased. The foundation sought to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it was immune from liability under &sect; 26 of the VHSPA. When the motion was denied, the foundation was allowed an interlocutory appeal to determine whether a 1988 amendment to &sect; 26, which revoked the immunity previously granted to all VHSPA corporations except one, was unconstitutional because it constituted special legislation. The court dismissed the appeal, holding that the resolution of that question would not affect the foundation's interests in any way and therefore would not materially advance the litigation in the case. In amending the VHSPA, the legislature intended that no health maintenance organization (HMO) be entitled to immunity. A single exception was made for one HMO because it was the only health service plan that the legislature felt still conformed to the original concept of the VHSPA. In light of this, the foundation's premise that it was entitled to the same protection as the exempted HMO because it was the same type of organization was flawed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the foundation's interlocutory appeal from the order denying its motion to dismiss the administrator's medical malpractice complaint.</SPAN></P>

The only evidence that went to the element of attempted luring was the child's testimony that defendant waved to her to come toward him from his parked vehicle. According to the child, defendant never said anything to her. The child testified that after defendant waved to her she turned her bicycle and rode away. The court held that without some affirmative conduct evidencing an intent to lure the child into defendant's vehicle, the innocuous gesture of waving was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was attempting to lure the child into his vehicle.</SPAN></P>
