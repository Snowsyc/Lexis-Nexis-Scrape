</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which convicted defendant of possession of marijuana in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11357.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer received an anonymous telephone call regarding narcotics activity, and was given defendant's name and address. Without a search warrant or an arrest warrant, the officer went to defendant's hotel room and attempted to purchase some marijuana; however, defendant denied having any marijuana. Through the partial open door, the officer could see an open suitcase on a bed with a large plastic bag containing a brown substance. Believing that the substance was marijuana, the officer then identified himself and demanded entry. Defendant was charged with possession of marijuana for sale. After defendant's motions to suppress evidence and to dismiss the information were denied, he withdrew his plea and entered a guilty plea to the lesser charge of possession of marijuana in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11357. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found Cal. Penal Code &sect; 836 authorized the warrantless search, and that an emergency situation was present as a matter of law. The totality of the circumstances demonstrated that the delay resulting from an eventual obtaining of an arrest warrant would have irrevocably resulted in the loss or destruction of evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction because defendant's arrest and the seizure of the marijuana were lawful. The record established the existence of exigent circumstances and the matter fell within the exception to the rule requiring a warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prison law office challenged the order of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California) that granted summary judgment in favor of respondent chairman of the board of prison terms, in appellant's action to enjoin implementation of the board's policy of releasing parolees to the county of commitment, subsequently codified as Cal. Penal Code &sect; 3003, and to declare &sect; 3003&nbsp;unconstitutional as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent board of prison terms formulated a policy of releasing parolees to the county of commitment, later codified as Cal. Penal Code &sect; 3003. Appellant prison law office sought to enjoin implementation of this policy on procedural grounds and to declare it unconstitutional as a matter of law. Summary judgment was entered in favor of respondent. This court affirmed because &sect; 3003 was constitutional on its face. A parolee's return to the commitment county was not mandated in every case as &sect; 3003 provided a non-inclusive list of factors to determine if the best interests of the public and parolee mandated release to another county or state. Thus, &sect; 3003 was a reasonable means to achieve the legitimate governmental ends of effective parole supervision and successful reintegration of parolees into society. Special scrutiny of &sect; 3003 was not required because the state did not relinquish its right to regulate the parolee's basic conduct during the remainder of the parole term. Finally, the statute was not overbroad as appellant did not demonstrate that the provisions inevitably posed a present total and fatal conflict with applicable prohibitions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court that entered summary judgment in favor of respondent board of prison terms as the statute governing the release of parolees to the county of commitment was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, reporter, editor, and publisher, printed a news article which disclosed information about public official, a real party in interest. Real party in interest sued for infliction of emotional distress, interference with economic advantage, libel, and invasion of privacy under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1798.53. The trial court dismissed all counts except for the invasion of privacy cause, on grounds that there was no triable issue of fact regarding actual malice. Petitioners' motion for summary judgment of the invasion of privacy action was denied on grounds that lack of actual malice was not a defense. Petitioners sought a writ of mandate to compel the trial court to grant the summary judgment. The court granted the writ, and directed the trial court to enter summary judgment in favor of petitioners, finding that the truthful disclosure of the information regarding real party in interest, as a public official, was privileged, despite the seriousness of the invasion of his privacy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, reporter, editor, and publisher's request for writ of mandate requiring respondent trial court to enter summary judgment in their favor was granted because their disclosure of information regarding public official, real party in interest, was not motivated by malice, and therefore, it was privileged and not actionable as an invasion of privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">intervenor appellants challenged an order from the Superior Court of Tehama County (California) that issued a peremptory writ of mandate to compel respondent county officials to perform duties imposed by state law without regard to the ordinance at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This lawsuit presented a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a county ordinance enacted by initiative. The ordinance purported to limit governmental authority to regulate the use of privately owned real property. The court found that certain provisions of the ordinance conflicted with general law in violation of Cal. Const. art., &sect; 7, and were therefore invalid. Other provisions of the ordinance did not conflict with general law and remained enforceable. Respondent citizens challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance by bringing suit against the county. Respondent citizens sought a writ of mandate compelling respondent county officials to perform duties imposed by state law without regard to the provisions of the ordinance. The writ was granted. In determining whether a partially valid enactment may be enforced as to the remainder, a declaration of severability in the enactment, although not conclusive, was persuasive evidence of the enacting body's intent. The judgment was reversed because not all of the provisions of the initiative were unconstitutional, therefore the valid portions were severed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting the writ of mandate compelling respondent county officials to perform duties imposed by state law was reversed and remanded because the several provisions in the ordinance passed by initiative were valid, and could be severed from the unconstitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction from the Superior Court of San Francisco County (California) for robbery under Cal. Penal Code, &sect; 211, contending that the trial court erred in failing to conduct a sincere and reasoned evaluation of the prosecutor's justifications for exercising four of his five peremptory challenges against black veniremen, and that evidence suppressed under Cal. Penal Code 1538.5 was improperly used at sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with armed robbery. At trial, he challenged the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to black jury veniremen. The trial judge accepted the prosecutor's claim that the challenges were for specific bias, denied defendant's challenge, and defendant's subsequent motion for a new trial on the same grounds. Defendant was convicted, and at sentencing, the trial judge admitted evidence, under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28 (Proposition 8), over defendant's objection, that a gun used in an earlier murder was found in defendant's possession, a fact that had been suppressed at trial. On appeal, the court first held that the trial record disclosed sufficient evidence to support the trial judge's ruling on the peremptory challenges issue. Next the court examined the scope of the exclusions provided by the state and federal Constitutions, and held that because the rule was judicial in nature, defendant had no absolute right in addition to his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV to suppression of the firearm evidence, and the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for robbery, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a new trial challenging the prosecutor's objection to certain veniremen, and that use of evidence suppressed at trial was not barred at sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was terminated under an automatic resignation provision of a collective bargaining agreement that allowed his employer to terminate employees, without any hearing, who were absent without leave for five consecutive days. Appellant claimed that he had informed his supervisor of his leave. The court held that appellant had a property right in his position and was entitled to due process prior to his termination. The court found that when appellant disputed that he was absent without leave, he could not be held to have abandoned that property right. The court found that the provision in the collective bargaining agreement was unconstitutional because it waived appellant's right to due process. The court ordered that appellant be provided a hearing as described in Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 89541.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Stanislaus County (California) which denied appellant's petition to modify a judgment of dissolution to allow division of respondent husband's military retirement pay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife challenged the trial court decision denying her petition to modify a judgment of dissolution to include a division of respondent husband's military retirement pay. The parties had agreed for the trial court to retain jurisdiction of the issue of divisibility of respondent's military retirement pay, pending the outcome of a United States Supreme Court case. The Supreme Court held that federal law precluded a state court from dividing military retired pay pursuant to state community property law. Congress responded by enacting the Federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (FUSFSPA), 10 U.S.C. &sect; 1408, the effect of which was that California law treating military retirement pensions as community property was no longer preempted. The court held that although the parties agreed to be bound by the Supreme Court resolution of the preemption issue, it would be unfair to ignore FUSFSPA and subsequent case law. The court held that by their agreement and FUSFSPA, appellant was entitled to one-half of respondent's military pension attributable to longevity of service, but not to benefits attributed to service-connected disability or to service prior to marriage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court because, where the parties had agreed the trial court could retain jurisdiction on the issue of division of respondent husband's military retirement pay, it was unfair and inequitable to decide the issue on the basis of case law, which had been effectively nullified by legislation and subsequent case law. The matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city enacted an ordinance authorizing a lease with a general partnership, which was to construct a hotel on property owned by appellant.

Less than one year later, appellant called a special election in which voters were to decide by initiative whether a revised agreement should be entered with the general partnership regarding the same property. Respondent filed suit, and the trial court entered an order precluding appellant from holding the election on the grounds that it was barred by Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 4014. Appellant sought review. The court held that Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 4014 only barred special initiative elections held within 12 months of each other, and did not bar a special referendum election followed by a special initiative election on the same subject.  Cal. Elec. Code &sect;&sect; 4014, 4055 and 4057 were unambiguous, required no construction, and did not preclude the election appellant proposed to hold.

Respondent agency found petitioner was not an employee of respondent university under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3352(k) and was not entitled to benefits. Petitioner appealed. The court held that Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3352(k), which was adopted after applicant was injured and which precluded an athlete's recovery of benefits, applied retroactively. Because the law regarding athletes was in a state of flux at the time petitioner was injured, and because petitioner's right to compensation was a purely statutory right, petitioner did not have a vested right in the unamended version of Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3352. With no vested right in his employee status at the time of his injury, he had no constitutional objection to retroactive application of the statute. The court found that retroactive application of the statute furthered a compelling state interest in clarifying the statutory definition excluding athletes as employees and did not grievously impair whatever rights petitioner had before the statute was amended. The order denying petitioner benefits was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued the modification and immediate sale of the home was an impairment of his vested property rights. The court affirmed, holding that appellant's title as a tenant in common was always subject to divestment or termination at the time the house was sold. The family home award was a temporary privilege subject to modification under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.7 to effectuate the purpose of the award.

Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 19594, 19595 allowed for an exception and that, under present day conditions, the prohibition against receiving, holding, or forwarding money to bet on horse races should be held invalid. The court affirmed the summary judgment enjoining appellants' activities and held that Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 19593, 19594, 19595 clearly limited pari-mutuel wagering to persons within the horse racing park. The court held that &sect; 19595 had continually and consistently been narrowly construed in light of the broad prohibition against bookmaking. The court held that irrespective of the more relaxed climate for gambling, &sect; 337(a) was not unconstitutional, and wagering via a messenger service was still proscribed by the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment enjoining illegal gambling activities was affirmed because appellant messenger service and clients' off-track betting scheme was prohibited by a statute that disallowed bookmaking. The statute was constitutional, and there were no applicable exceptions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order from the Superior Court of Contra Costa County (California), which convicted him of first degree burglary and second degree burglary under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was in custody, charged with one burglary, when an officer took him to the location of several burglaries and questioned him, without counsel. Defendant confessed to several crimes and said of the residence of the burglary for which he was charged, &quot;Well I could have burglarized it.&quot; Defendant's statements were admitted at trial and he was convicted of first degree and second degree burglary under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 459 and attempted burglary under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 459, 664. Defendant appealed, arguing that his U.S. Const. amend. VI rights were violated, and the court affirmed. The court found that, while it was unconstitutional to interrogate a defendant without counsel about a charged crime, it was not necessarily a violation to question him regarding uncharged crimes. Since defendant was questioned about both, the court found that the crimes were not so related as to jeopardize effective representation on the charged crime. Thus, the confessions of uncharged crimes were properly admitted. The court found that admission of defendant's charged crime statement was error; however, it was not reversible error because the statement did not contribute to his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, finding that the trial court did not err in admitting defendant's confessions obtained for crimes not yet charged at the time he was interrogated without counsel. The court found that the trial court did err in admitting his admission regarding a crime for which he was already charged, but that the error was not reversible.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c12">13&nbsp;We wish to stress that our decision should not be construed as expressing any opinion on the adequacy of the settlement.  We have issued the writ solely because of the procedural concerns which we have expressed.  After discovery and a new good faith hearing, the court, guided by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Tech-Bilt</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"> criteria, is not precluded from deciding that the settlement here is in good faith.  Struggling through this case we too have pondered the question whether section 877.6, subdivision (c), as applied is constitutional as to persons who are not given the opportunity to appear and participate in the good faith hearing.  (See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Singer Co. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> Superior Court, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">, 179 Cal.App.3d 875.) That issue, however, was neither briefed nor argued.  Moreover, in light of our result which is consistent with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Singer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"> there is no need to explore the constitutional ramifications of the statute's application.  Putting aside constitutional considerations, however, basic fairness requires that every defendant facing potential liability be allowed to participate in settlement negotiations and contest the alleged good faith of any settlement among other defendants.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed that insurer's alleged bad faith in failing to protect her interests during settlement negotiations rendered the entire settlement &quot;in bad faith&quot; for the purposes of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, injured party, filed a personal injury action against the owner, operator and employees of a summer camp and its insurer. Insurer took the position that appellant, camp counselor, was not an employee of the camp and therefore did not qualify as an &quot;additional insured&quot; under its liability policy. As a result, insurer made no attempt to represent appellant's interests in the settlement negotiations. Appellant's own homeowner's insurance company provided an attorney to represent them at the settlement hearing pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 877.6, but they requested a continuance in order to take discovery. The trial court denied the continuance and found the settlement to be in good faith. On appeal, the court found that appellant's participation in the hearing was pro forma at best, due to the timing problems. The court also held that appellant had a right to take discovery regarding the good faith of the settlement. Therefore, the court issued a writ directing the trial court to vacate its finding that the settlement was in good faith and to allow appellant reasonable discovery before recalendaring the good faith hearing.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff's employer was not licensed as required by law. The court noted that generally workers' compensation is an employee's exclusive remedy against an employer for injuries arising out of employment. The court held that, because a license was a condition of independent contractor status, plaintiff's employer was an employee of defendant and, consequently, plaintiff was also defendant's employee. As such, the court held that plaintiff's remedy for his injuries was limited to workers' compensation. The court found that the dual capacity doctrine did not apply to defendant's concurrent roles as employer and land owner so as to impose a separate legal obligation. Finally, the court concluded that, because plaintiff was not using the building as would an ultimate user of the product, he could not state a cause of action based on defendant's liability as a manufacturer of a defective product. The court affirmed the award of summary judgment to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee sued defendant public entity for discrimination, retaliation in employment, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.

On appeal, plaintiff argued that the 1963 Government Tort Claims Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 818, which precluded punitive damages against a public entity, violated the equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend XIV, and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court affirmed and held that punitive damages against a public entity were not allowed, absent a specific statute expressly allowing them. The court held that the equal protection clause did not prohibit legislative classification and imposition of statutory restraints on one class which were not imposed on another. The court held that the classification between governmental and nongovernmental tort victims had a fair relation to the object of the legislation and promoted a number of legitimate interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order imposed by the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which extended defendant's commitment to a state hospital under Cal. Penal Code &sect;1026.5(b), following a jury trial in which defendant was found to be suffering from a mental disease, defect, or disorder which caused him to represent a substantial danger of physical harm to others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was committed to a state hospital after having been found not guilty by reason of insanity of assault with a deadly weapon. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the state's petition for an extension of his commitment and extended his commitment for two years. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the state was not required to prove that the underlying conduct posed a serious threat of bodily harm to another person because the issue was previously determined in a prior commitment proceeding. The court noted that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1026.5(b)(1) was amended to only require proof that defendant was previously committed under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1026 for a felony. The court found that the amendment to &sect; 1026.5(b)(1) precluded defendant's statutory interpretation and equal protection arguments. The amendment to &sect; 1026.5(b)(1) did not violate the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, or Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, because recommitment procedures cannot disadvantage defendant in a determination of criminal guilt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order extending defendant's commitment to a state hospital because his underlying offense, assault with a deadly weapon, fell within the commitment statute. Defendant's equal protection claim was without merit. The recommitment procedures did not violate the ex post facto clause because they did not disadvantage defendant in the determination of his criminal guilt.</SPAN></P>

The writ was denied and appellants sought review. The court held that due process required that appellants have an opportunity to be heard prior to the destruction of their dog. The court held that the hearing requirement could not be implied from the county ordinances and reversed the trial court's judgment, holding that the ordinances were unconstitutional for failure to provide for notice and a hearing either before or after the seizure of an uncontrollable biting or vicious dog.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant injured minor was hurt on property maintained by respondent city, and filed a claim, pursuant to Cal.

After expiration of the six-month period, appellant filed an application with respondent to present a late claim for damages where he named employees of respondent who had been negligent. The application was not considered because a timely application on the claim had already been filed. Appellant petitioned the trial court for an order relieving him of the claim filing requirements of &sect; 945.4. The petition was denied and appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding where a separate claim was not required, appellant's petition was properly denied because under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 950.6, the six-month statute of limitations of &sect; 945.6 barred any action for damages for personal injuries against respondent's employees. The court found &sect; 945.6 required an action against an employee to be commenced within the time prescribed for bringing an action against the public entity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed denial of appellant injured minor's petition where appellant's proposed late claim against respondent city's employees had the same basis of potential liability as his claim against respondent which was barred by the six-month statute of limitations. The court held the later claim was no more than an attempt to amend appellant's original claim; thus, the six-month statute of limitations ran from the date of the original claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for murder, residential robbery, and burglary. The state laboratory had fully consumed the blood and urine samples that had been collected from defendant, notwithstanding defendant's request that they be provided for independent testing. The court determined that defendant was not denied due process of law by the state's failure to preserve potentially favorable evidence or by the trial court's failure to impose an appropriate sanction. The court ruled that whatever duty the Constitution imposed on the States to preserve evidence, that duty was limited to evidence that might be expected to play a significant role in defendant's defense. To be material, the evidence had to possess exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and be of such a nature that defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other available means. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and found no authority which supported defendant's proposition that life in prison without possibility of parole was disproportionate to the crime of first degree felony murder where the killing was intentional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Contra Costa County (California), which granted plaintiff theatre owners' claim for declaratory and injunctive relief and held that defendant's &quot;admissions tax&quot; was an unconstitutional interference with plaintiffs' protected free speech. The trial court issued preliminary and permanent injunctions, concluding that the tax impermissibly burdened free speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff theatre owners operated the only theatres in defendant city when an ordinance was adopted levying a five percent tax on the admission price of sporting events, movie theatres, concerts, shows, museums, performances, displays, and exhibitions within defendant city. The tax was enacted primarily to generate revenue for needed street repairs. The financing plan for those repairs, later approved by the city council, included a tax increase and three new taxes, including the admissions tax. The projected yield for the first year of the tax was based solely on the estimated revenues from plaintiffs' movie theatres. Although worded broadly so as to apply to other forms of entertainment, plaintiffs' theatres were the only businesses currently affected by the tax, although the main interest asserted by the city in enacting the tax was the raising of revenue. The court affirmed the trial court's holding that the admissions tax was discriminatory as it applied to plaintiff. Even if the admissions tax, as written, could otherwise pass constitutional muster, the impact of the tax on plaintiffs' theatres was discriminatory and violated the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, holding that defendant city's &quot;admissions tax,&quot; as applied to plaintiff theatre owners, infringed their federal constitutional rights to free speech and equal protection. The court held that the tax imposed an impermissible differential burden on plaintiffs' businesses and was not necessary to achieve the goal of raising revenue.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the pendency of deportation proceedings was an adequate basis for finding defendants were unfit for a narcotics abuse program under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 3053. The court reasoned that the purpose behind the narcotics abuse programs was to rehabilitate persons and that defendants' out patient treatments would likely be interrupted prior to their being cured. The court found that the pendency of deportation proceedings placed the state court in a secondary position in terms of continued control over defendants. The courts held defendants were entitled to a meaningful opportunity to respond to the exclusion but were not entitled to be present when the decisions were made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments that found defendant Mexican nationals were unfit for narcotics abuse treatment program. The court held that deportation holds placed on defendants by Immigration and Naturalization Service was a sufficient basis for the Director of Corrections to have rejected defendants from the program where defendants were unlikely to complete the outpatient program.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' action for a judicial determination that a personal income tax deficiency assessed by defendant was illegal.

XIII, &sect; 32 until they paid defendant's assessment. A taxpayer may not circumvent restraints on prepayment tax litigation by seeking only declaratory relief. Plaintiffs attempted to circumvent the statutory scheme in an effort to obtain adjudication of their claims before payment. The court stated that &sect; 32 meant what it said. Nothing in the policy underlying &sect; 32, its history, or the cases construing it, supported an exception.

Thus, application would be the clearest sort of due process denial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city added a rent control law to its charter. Respondent taxpayers challenged its validity, seeking an injunction. The trial court determined that appellant board's standards for determining rent increases, the net operating income approach, were constitutional and upheld them. The trial court found, however, that the rent control law's removal aspects were unconstitutional, and permanently enjoined appellants from regulating or prohibiting demolitions of controlled rental housing. Appellants contended that the trial court misapplied the law. Respondents argued that the rent control law was unconstitutional. The court found that the trial court did not err in finding that the rent control law and regulations were constitutional. It reversed the trial court's judgment, however, holding that the trial court erred in concluding that fair market value was determined a landlord's fair return, that a rent control ordinance guaranteed owners anticipated appreciation, that a municipal rent control ordinance must provide self-executing procedures for removal from controls via demolition, and that owners were protected from the combination of rent control and removal restrictions.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was sentenced to six years for vehicular homicide, and eight months for the &sect; 23153(a) count. Appellant sought review, arguing that the jury was not instructed clearly that gross negligence may not be found solely because of driving under the influence of alcohol. The court agreed, reversing the judgment and remanding for retrial. The court also criticized the trial court's sentencing: the trial court had ignored factors favoring probation, and considered only criteria supporting a denial of probation. Further, the criteria were not applicable: the victim was not &quot;vulnerable,&quot; and appellant's crime was not &quot;especially contemptible.&quot; In imposing a consecutive term for the DUI causing injury, the trial court applied criteria improperly. The court rejected appellant's claim that the six-year term was disproportionate to the crime. The court reversed the sentence for the DUI causing injury as barred by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which imposed a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole after he was found guilty of murder in the first degree, Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of killing his victim because of victim's nationality. The court held that eyewitness testimony, taken together with the evidence of the shooting itself, including the ballistics evidence, clearly justified the inference that defendant and his companion were waiting for the victim to stop at the corner on his way to work. The jury was justified in concluding that the defendant intended to kill his victim. The court found no prosecutorial misconduct in impeaching defense witnesses, in the destruction of a jail record, or in final argument. The court found no jury misconduct concerning an improper matter because there was no evidence that the jury had considered it in reaching its decision. Because defendant's intent was the subject of adequate instructions, there was no reversible error in the instructions which were given. The statute which included special circumstances based on the victim's nationality was not impermissibly vague. Thus, the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, finding &sect; 3003 was constitutional under either substantive due process or equal protection analysis pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Cal. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7, because the goal of equal distribution of parolees throughout the state was a legitimate, reasonable state goal. The court found that the state did not relinquish its right to regulate the parolee's basic conduct during the remainder of the term of parole by allowing a parolee to serve the remainder of his sentence outside prison walls. Because the state was constitutionally permitted to restrict a prisoner's liberty by incarcerating him and to require a parolee to live in a particular place during the parole period, then &sect; 3003, which specified in which county the parolee would spend his term of parole, also was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 3057 regarding his confinement by the California Rehabilitation Center where petitioner was returned as a parole violator, after being arrested for using heroin.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While on parole from the California Rehabilitation Center (center), petitioner was arrested for using heroin. Thereafter, petitioner was returned to the center. Subsequently, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 3057, he was being wrongfully held in that confinement pursuant to a revocation of parole could not exceed 12 months and that because he had been confined longer than 12 months his equal protection rights had been violated. On review, the court denied the writ. The court ruled that petitioner was not wrongfully confined because he was not being held under the Penal Code but rather the Welfare and Institutions Code and that the Welfare and Institutions Code did not have the provision petitioner asserted. The court noted that petitioner's equal protection rights were not being violated because the state had a compelling interest to rehabilitate rather than punish civil addicts in order to prevent drug-related crime. Thus, the court found a compelling justification for the distinction between the confinement of a state prison inmate and that of a civil addict committee.</SPAN></P>

The lower court granted respondent's motion and awarded her an interest in appellant's pension. Appellant challenged the lower court's order and the constitutionality of &sect; 5124. The court affirmed the decision of the lower court because the settlement of the parties' divorce action occurred when federal law conflicted with state law and, therefore, &sect; 5124 applied because it was enacted to redress the conflicting situation. The court held that &sect; 5124 did not interfere with the parties' stipulation to the division of their marital property because the agreement contemplated pending legislation for the determination of the military pension and, therefore, was not a final judgment for purposes of the constitution.</SPAN></P>

The superior court, on remittitur, awarded respondents $ 209,514.50 in attorney fees and $ 14,539.88 in costs. Appellant challenged the orders. The court affirmed, as modified, striking the costs for printing briefs filed in the federal supreme court because such costs were non-recoverable under the supreme court's own rules. The award was proper because important rights had been enforced which benefited the public as a result of the action. The court noted that respondent's ability to financially bear the costs was irrelevant and the fact that the fee award would create a financial burden for taxpayers also did not constitute a special circumstance rendering the fee unjust.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), that convicted him of aggravated assault under Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of aggravated assault under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 245(a), with a special finding that he intentionally inflicted great bodily injury upon the victim under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.7. The trial court found that defendant had three prior serious felony convictions and sentenced him to 21 years of confinement. Defendant sought review, contending that the trial court erred in finding that he had three prior serious felony convictions and in enhancing his prison sentence for those convictions under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that proof of a prior conviction established only the minimum elements of the crime, even if the charging document contained additional, superfluous allegations. The court noted that the prosecution could not go behind the record of the conviction and relitigate the circumstances of the offense to prove some fact that was not an element of the crime. The court held that the proof of defendant's prior convictions was consistent with those restrictions and that the enhancements were properly imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In municipal court, a group of defendants demurred to charges that they violated Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647(d), which prohibited loitering in or about public toilets to engage in or solicit lewd or lascivious acts. The demurrers were overruled. Defendants then petitioned the superior court for writs of mandate or prohibition, which were granted for all defendants except one. Petitioners, the people and the denied defendant, sought review. The court rejected defendants' arguments that &sect; 647(d) was unconstitutional on its face. The court held that the conduct described in the statute was validly defined as a crime, as it was neither entirely innocent nor passive. The court held that the statute was not void for vagueness, because it provided notice of the proscribed conduct, and because its lack of objective criteria to guide a police officer in deciding the criminality of conduct did not distinguish it from several others statutes keyed to specific intent. The court ordered the superior court to vacate its grant of defendants' petitions for the writ, and denied the petition of petitioner defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the suit brought by plaintiffs to enforce the trial court's original judgment, plaintiffs argued that there were still unacceptable disparities between school districts in money expended per pupil for public education. As a result of the original trial, defendant state was required to reduce disparities in per-pupil expenditures caused by differences in district property wealth. In the enforcement action, the lower court ruled that the original judgment should be read to require elimination of all but &quot;insignificant differences&quot; in per-pupil funding. In affirming the trial judge, the court agreed that the legislature had done all that was reasonably feasible to reduce disparities in per-pupil expenditures and that wealth-related differences in school spending had been reduced to insignificant levels. The court also agreed that while education is a fundamental interest, every statute that touched upon education need not be subject to strict scrutiny. The court found that the system of school finance satisfied all compelling state interests and satisfied the rational relationship test of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the current system of school financing was equitable and that any remaining differences in per-pupil expenditures were both insignificant and justified by legitimate state interests.</SPAN></P>

The prosecution alleged one overall conspiracy, and various acts relating to the plan to kill the first victim were alleged as overt acts in the conspiracy to murder the second victim. Defendant alleged that the admission into evidence of these acts was improper. The court held that the evidence showed two conspiracies, and that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the conspiracy to kill the first victim. However, the court held that the error was not reversible because it was unlikely that a more favorable result would have been reached in the absence of the error. The court held that the enhancement for great bodily injury under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.7, could not be imposed in conjunction with defendant's conviction for conspiracy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, defendants in the underlying action, sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent superior court to vacate its order denying their motion to dismiss for untimely return of summons. The summons and proof of service were filed more than three years, but less than 60 days, after the complaint was filed. The court rejected the argument of real parties in interest, plaintiffs below, that the one-year phase-in for a new provision, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 583.210, which allowed a three-year period for service and 60 days beyond that period to file proof of service, was confusing and vague. The phase-in provision, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 583.160, was plain on its face and could not be ignored. Thus, under the phase-in statute, the former Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 581a applied, making the return untimely when filed after three years of the commencement of the action. A request for an extension of time to respond to the complaint did not extend the time because it was made after the expiration of the three-year period. The court found that dismissal of the action was mandated because the return was untimely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered a peremptory writ of mandate to issue directing respondent superior court to vacate its order denying petitioners' motion to quash summons and to enter an order granting the motion. Under the relevant statute, the return of summons was untimely because it was filed more than three years after commencement of the action.</SPAN></P>

The trial court terminated the parental relationship under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 232(a)(2) &amp; (4). The court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court found the evidence was insufficient to support the termination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by information with murder in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187, but was convicted of the lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 192. Defendant argued that the action was barred by the statute of limitations, the prosecution improperly impeached a defense witness, and it was error to impose the upper term sentence. On review the court found that at the time of the offense, the statute of limitation for manslaughter was three years, and because the pleadings failed to show some bar to the limitation, the conviction was jurisdictionally defective. The court held however that the error was not prejudicial and did not require reversal because the issuance of the arrest warrant shortly after the offense tolled the limitations period as a matter of law. The court held that application did not violate the ex post facto clause because a law that increased a limitations period or provided a new method of tolling it could have been immediately applied to all crimes, as long the period had not yet run under the prior law. The court rejected defendant's other arguments and affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 11401. Appellant filed suit for refunds for tax years 1977 and 1980. Each suit claimed appellant was exempt from the PRCTL, that only the income method of valuation should have applied, that respondent's findings were not supported by substantial evidence, that respondent's procedures did not comport with due process, and that respondent's action resulted in multiple taxation. The trial court rendered judgment for respondent. In consolidated appeals, appellant challenged the adverse trial court rulings that upheld respondent's acts of levying an escape assessment by disallowing a claim for functional obsolescence and refusing to use only the income capitalization method to value appellant's fleet of flatcars for the tax years 1977 through 1980 under the PRCTL. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment holding that appellant's flatcar fleet was not exempt from the PRCTL and that the legislature intended for flatcars to be included within the scope of the PRCTL.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee received workers' compensation benefits for an injury sustained at work, and settled a separate medical malpractice action against the hospital that treated her.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which was entered on the jury finding that defendant was guilty of false imprisonment by violence or menace and of two counts of robbery and on the trial court's finding that defendant had suffered a prior conviction for robbery for which defendant served a prison term.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury found defendant guilty of false imprisonment by violence or menace and of two counts of robbery, the trial court dismissed the jury. Thereafter a hearing was held, following which the trial court found that defendant had suffered a prior robbery conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions, but remanded the case for a trial on the issue of the prior felony conviction because defendant did not waive his right of trial by jury, which was assured by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1025, Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, and the federal Constitution. The court held that where defendant matched the physical description given by a witness and defendant's fingerprints were found on stolen property, the victim's in-the-field identification of defendant was not so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. The court ruled that the trial court did not err in admitting defendant's confession because the police officer's good faith confrontation did not render the confession involuntary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, holding that the victim's identification of defendant was not so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification, and that defendant's confession was not coerced. The court remanded the case for a trial on the issue of the prior felony conviction because defendant had a right to trial by jury on that issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dispute over the assets of a bank in conservatorship, under 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1464(d)(6)(D), with petitioner Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), petitioner sought a peremptory writ of prohibition to restrain respondent Superior Court of San Joaquin County (California) from proceeding further on a complaint filed against the bank and to direct respondent to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court granted the writ of prohibition and held that respondent lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the dispute. To ensure that all claims against a failed savings and loan association placed in receivership were expeditiously resolved in a single forum, Congress provided, in &sect; 1464(d)(6)(C), that no court could restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of a conservator or receiver. Congress intended to give the FSLIC, acting as receiver of an insolvent association, exclusive authority to administratively resolve creditors' claims in order to facilitate speedy liquidation. Section 1464(d)(6)(C) set forth a jurisdictional prerequisite that the right to judicial review would vest only after completion of an administrative action.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the trial court's restitution order exceeded its authority. Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28(b) was not a self-executing constitutional provision and neither statutory nor constitutional authority supported the trial court's order of direct restitution. The order lacked statutory basis under either the presently effective or then-applicable framework, neither of which provided for direct restitution, orders greater than $ 10,000, or compensation for property losses or pain and suffering. The court remanded, requesting a more reliable factual basis to be developed for restitution, and that appellant be provided a reasonable opportunity to be heard to determine whether a restitution order was warranted under former Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being arrested by respondent police officers, appellant arrestee brought a claim against respondents and the city for false arrest. At trial, respondents demurred to appellant's claim pursuant to Cal.

The court sustained respondents' demurrer and dismissed the claim, apparently on the grounds that &sect; 945.3, as amended, barred appellant from bringing the claim. On review, the court reversed, holding that &sect; 945.3, which prevented police and their employers from being sued for false arrest while criminal charges following an arrest were pending, did not require the plaintiff to file a claim within the applicable period under the California Tort Claims Act. The court ruled that &sect; 945.3, as originally enacted and applicable at the time of appellant's claim, suspended the requirement to present notice of a claim until the underlying criminal proceedings were completed. The court also ruled that retroactivation of &sect; 945.3, as amended, would be unconstitutional in that it would cut off appellant's remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal of appellant arrestee's false arrest complaint against respondent city and police officers. The court ruled that appellant was not barred from bringing the complaint because at the time of the action the applicable statute of limitations was tolled. The court also refused to retroactivate the amended statute to bar appellant's complaint because such application would be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff borrower contended that a note, which called for interest at an annual rate of 40 percent, was usurious. The court noted that the loan at issue was usurious unless the real estate broker exemption applied. The court found that the transaction was between plaintiff, a real estate broker, and defendant lender, each acting on his own behalf, and that there was no third party licensed real estate broker acting for compensation as intermediary. The court concluded that the loan was not &quot;arranged&quot; by a broker within the meaning of the usury law; therefore, the loan was not exempt from the proscription of Cal. Const. art. XV and was usurious. The court found that plaintiff tendered to defendant an amount in excess of his legal obligation, which was only the principal; therefore, he was released from all subsequent liability for interests, costs, and attorney fees incurred by defendant in connection with the foreclosure proceedings. The court reversed and found that plaintiff's payment in full of the underlying debt also discharged both the obligation and the deed of trust, so he was entitled to a full reconveyance of the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After respondent car manufacturer terminated its agreement with appellant new car dealer (dealer), dealer filed a protest of termination with appellant New Motor Vehicle Board (board). Board adopted the decision of the administrative law judge that respondent lacked good cause to terminate the dealership and the recommendation that the dealership continue, but relocate within two years. Both respondent and dealer filed petitions for writs of mandate to set aside the decision. The trial court granted respondent's petition, finding that board's composition which included new car dealers as members, but specifically excluded any car manufacturers as members, denied respondent's constitutional right to an impartial tribunal. Upon review, the court affirmed, finding that the provisions of Cal. Veh. Code &sect;&sect; 3050(d) and 3066(d), which prevented new car dealer members of board from deciding matters involving dealer-manufacturer disputes, but permitted them to participate in, hear, comment, and advise other members, had the effect of denying a manufacturer litigant its constitutional right to an impartial tribunal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought an order reducing the noneconomic portion of the damages pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3333.2, and an amendment to the economic damages to be paid on a periodic basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff minor suffered permanent brain damage, leaving her substantially retarded, with a mental age of five months at 10 years of age. Plaintiff filed suit against defendant hospital, seeking damages for medical malpractice. The jury awarded plaintiff for medical, nursing care, lost future earnings, and pain and suffering. Defendant filed a motion seeking an order reducing the noneconomic portion (pain and suffering) of the judgment pursuant to Cal. Civ.

The court held that &sect; 667.7 was applicable and remanded to the trial court to make a periodic payment order for the economic portion (lost earnings, medical, nursing, and training expenses) of the damages. The court, rejecting defendant's claim of excessive damages, held that there was credible evidence to support jury's award. The court held that the Cal.

The people, the real party in interest, (people) initially decided not to seek the death penalty, but changed its decision after reviewing new aggravating evidence. When respondent trial court denied petitioner's motion to prohibit a change in the death penalty decision, petitioner sought a peremptory writ, which the court denied for two reasons. First, there was no enforceable contract between the parties that barred a change, and petitioner did not give up valuable constitutional rights because he was entitled to a death penalty trial if needed. The court noted that petitioner was not denied due process of law because the trial had not begun and he had ample time to prepare a defense. Second, people's decision to pursue the death penalty was not arbitrary or cruel and or unusual punishment under the federal or state constitutions because the new evidence resulted in a material change in the circumstances, and people properly exercised prosecutorial discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner asbestos manufacturers filed actions against real party insurers alleging bad faith refusal to defend and indemnify claims and seeking punitive and compensatory damages. Respondent superior court ruled that Pennsylvania and English law applied to the questions of punitive damages. Petitioners argued that California law applied to the issue. The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate commanding respondent to set aside those portions of its orders determining that Pennsylvania law and English law governed the actions on the question of punitive damages for bad faith conduct and to enter orders holding that California law applied. The court applied a &quot;comparative impairment&quot; approach, the court found that requiring California to adopt Pennsylvania's rule against punitive damages would create an archaic result in the context of the modern realities of the insurers' role as a multistate corporation and would require California to assist Pennsylvania in sheltering a corporation whose blatant misconduct, if proved, might cause damage outside its home state. The court also held that English law, which also did not allow punitive damages in this case, would not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stipulated judgment of dissolution of the marriage of appellant wife and respondent husband confirmed respondent's military retirement benefits to him as his separate property, based on existing federal decisional law. The judgment became final before the effective date of the Federal Uniform Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (FUSFSPA), 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1408. The trial court had not reserved jurisdiction of the case. Appellant moved to modify the dissolution judgment, based on Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 5124, which permitted modification of community property judgments and agreements entered in the hiatus period between the federal decision and the enactment of FUSFSPA. The trial court denied the motion and declared &sect; 5124&nbsp;unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 5124 was constitutional because the impairment to existing contracts was sufficiently necessary to the public welfare to justify the impairment. The statute did not violate due process, nor the contract clause. Section 5124 did not attempt to override or expand on FUSFSPA. The clear intent and effect of &sect; 5124 was to provide a procedure by which final community property settlements and judgments could be reopened.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was awarded costs on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a rotary club and two women, sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which held that respondent, the International Rotary Club, could lawfully revoke appellant's charter and that respondent's male-only policy did not violate the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 51, or Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, two women and a local Rotary club, sought review of the lower court's decision that the male-only policy of respondent, the International Rotary Club, was not a violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 51. The charter of appellant club was revoked after the club admitted the two individual appellants and a third woman. The trial court held that respondent and the individual local clubs were not business establishments within the meaning of the Unruh Act. The Unruh Act expressly prohibited sex based discrimination by business establishments. The lower court also found that to preclude enforcement of respondent's male-only policy in the state of California would effect the freedom of association of persons outside of the state. On review, the court found that respondent was clearly a business establishment that conferred considerable benefit on its members. The court also held that freedom of association, while a fundamental freedom, did not protect respondent from the effect of the Unruh Act. As such, the court reversed the lower court's decision denying appellants' injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was reversed. The charter of appellant local rotary club was improperly revoked when appellant club admitted appellant women, because respondent International Rotary Club's male-only policy constituted sex discrimination under California law, and the rotary clubs constituted &quot;business establishments.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court held that, pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc.

On appeal, appellants contended that California law should apply, rules involving dissolving corporations were irrelevant, and current Texas law precluded the result. The court held that appellants waived the issue of applicable California law as they raised the claim for the first time on appeal, and that, even if the issue was not waived, the trial court was correct in applying art. 7.12, as Texas had a greater interest. The court held that equitable estoppel was not available, as art. 7.12 was not a statute of limitations, and that appellants were afforded no more rights under the statute than a defunct corporation.

The court concluded that defendant did not present statistics showing the percentage of juror-eligible blacks within a 20-mile radius of the courthouse to show fair-cross-section requirement violation in the jury venire; therefore, no prima facie showing of underrepresentation was made. The court held that because defendant did not have benefit of the court's definition of community, he should not be foreclosed from renewing his motion and making the relevant statistical showing of juror eligible blacks residing within the 20-mile radius of the Santa Monica courthouse.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-wife and respondent ex-husband were divorced and respondent was awarded his nondisability retirement pension as his separate property. Appellant filed a motion to set aside the full pension award to respondent in order that part thereof be awarded to her as community property. Appellant contended that the newly enacted Federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (Act) was to be applied retroactively to final judgments. The lower court denied appellant's motion so she filed a similar motion under newly enacted Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 5124, which was also denied. The court affirmed and held that the express language of the Act indicated that Congress had not intended it to be applied retroactively to final judgments made prior to its effective date and pursuant to a Supreme Court decision which declared that a pension belonged exclusively to a military spouse. The court found that because the Supreme Court decision was the supreme law of the land for nondisability military pension awards finalized between June 26, 1981 and February 1, 1983, &sect; 5124 had to yield to such decision under the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art.

The trial court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment finding no triable issues of material fact which appellants challenged. The court affirmed judgment because it found numerous state statutes, including the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5000 et seq., which manifested a clear legislative intent to wholly occupy the area of law regarding psychiatric care and services, preempting the enactment of a local ordinance that added extra requirements on existing legislation for the use of ECT.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former wife filed suit to reduce the underpayment of her interest in defendant's military retired pay. The trial court awarded plaintiff a one-half community property interest but applied the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (FUSFSPA), 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1408, to limit her interest. Plaintiff challenged the trial court's calculation, and defendant asserted that the trial court lacked jurisdiction under the FUSFSPA. On appeal, the court affirmed that part of the judgment related to plaintiff's interest and held that plaintiff had a community property interest in one-half of defendant's gross retirement benefits at the time of judgment and subsequent increases directly related thereto. However, those increases did not include defendant's increased benefits received from the postdissolution aggravation of his disability. As a result, the court reversed the trial court's method of calculating plaintiff's interest. The court also rejected defendant's jurisdictional challenge because there was no basis upon which to retroactively apply FUSFSA, and to do so would unconstitutionally destroy plaintiff's vested property right in defendant's benefits.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 187, and one count of attempted murder under Cal. Pen. Code &sect;&sect; 187, 664. The court found no error in the jury instructions because the jury knew it was necessary to find that appellant acted with a subjective appreciation of the risk his conduct created, and that express malice was necessary. Proposition 7 did not violate appellant's procedural due process rights by punishing all degrees of attempted murder in the same way because its title fairly and sufficiently described the initiative and did not mislead the public. Appellant's substantive due process rights were not violated because &sect; 664 punishing all attempted murders equally was rationally related to a proper legislative goal, nor were his equal protection rights violated because his fundamental interest in liberty was not involved, the strict scrutiny test did not apply, and a rational basis existed to punish all attempted murders equally.

The court reversed the lower court's denial of an attorney's fees award because plaintiff was a prevailing party when it obtained the essential relief it sought in its complaint. The court held that plaintiff's civil rights were violated because the nonspeculative threat of the enforcement of unconstitutional zoning laws constituted a deprivation of civil rights sufficient to invoke &sect; 1983. The court rejected defendant's claim that because petitioner had never been denied its constitutional rights due to defendant's concession and lack of enforcement, a special circumstance existed that justified the denial of attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, because real party in interest's cause of action arising from election campaigning was not authorized in the Cal. Elec. Code, the legislature recognized that any attempt at wholesale regulation of, or government intrusion into, the content of political literature was constitutionally impermissible.</SPAN></P>

A permit was issued that included a doughnut-shaped open-space easement around the inn.

Respondent challenged the easement shift and claimed that the two easements were intended for different purposes. The court reversed the lower court's grant of an administrative mandamus order that ordered appellant to strike the easement condition. The court reasoned that the easement could be moved because the same purpose would be served when the project as a whole could be conditioned to provide scenic protection as required by Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 30251. The court held that the open-space easement permit condition was constitutional because it was reasonably related to one of the Coastal Act's principle objectives of preserving the scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas and was supported by evidence in the record.</SPAN></P>

The right to pursue one's chosen profession was not a fundamental right, therefore, the court applied a rational relationship test to the trial court's appointment. Not all attorneys were required to participate in the pro bono work, and other groups such as grocers, were not required to provide food to the poor.

The court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in implicitly ruling against appellants on the interim harm factor. The court found that appellants showed no harm that resulted from enforcement of the ordinance. Appellant resident taxpayer failed to assert any threat or injury to himself personally from enforcement of the ordinance. Moreover, appellant attorney's claim that enforcement of the ordinance would result in prosecutions of his law practice was without merit. Respondents proffered testimony by a police officer that indicated the need to regulate escort services. The court found apparent harm in the form of criminal activity such as prostitution that would impact respondents if enforcement of the ordinance was enjoined. Therefore, the court did not address the merits of appellants' constitutional arguments.</SPAN></P>

Appellant resident taxpayer sought to enjoin the illegal expenditure of public funds, while appellant attorney sought to protect himself from violating the ordinance as a practicing attorney. The cause had been transferred with directions to determine whether the lower court had abused its discretion by failing to satisfy the &quot;interim harm&quot; factor necessary for issuing injunctions. The court affirmed the order denying the preliminary injunction and concluded that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in finding impliedly against appellants on the interim harm factor. In determining whether a preliminary injunction was to be issued, the court compared the interim harm that appellants would have sustained if the injunction were denied to the harm respondent would have suffered if the preliminary injunction were granted.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of defendants and held that the window provision, Cal. Gov. Code &sect; 51282.1, of the Williamson Act (Act), Cal. Gov. Code &sect; 51200 et seq., did not violate Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 8. The court reversed the trial court. The court found no indication that the constitutional provision permitted the legislature to define enforceable restrictions at all, much less to define restrictions which did not actually serve to restrict the use of the land at issue and that the constitution merely allowed the legislature to specify the manner in which land was enforceably restricted. The court held that the window cancellation provision provided a windfall rather than equitable relief from a change in Supreme Court doctrine. The court concluded that the specific provisions of the Act itself supported the conclusion that the statute was intended to operate without the window provision.</SPAN></P>

However, the Federal Uniform Services Former Spouses' Protection Act, 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1408, authorized courts to treat interests in military pensions as community property. Respondents' motion for modification ensued, and the trial court granted the motion and awarded respondent a community interest in appellants' military pension. On appeal, the court reversed because Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 5124 granted relief only to parties who mistakenly treated military pensions as separate property due to the previous treatment of military pensions as separate property. The court remanded for the trial court to make a factual finding as to whether the parties treated appellant's military pension as separate property because of bargaining or because of the prior treatment of military pensions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court opined that respondents acquired a vested right to undertake and complete development of the subject property as was contemplated and implicitly sanctioned by the original four-lot subdivision without the need for further subdivision of the property. The court affirmed in part, holding that the doctrine of vested rights protected property owners from changes in land use regulations which occurred before completion of the owner's development project by permitting completion of the development notwithstanding an intervening change in the law that would otherwise preclude it.

The court reversed the order, holding that the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant's continuance request where denial of a continuance forced defendant to elect between giving up his right not to be deposed as a criminal defendant and his right to testify on his own behalf in the proceeding to deprive him of custody of his daughter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband sought review of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which characterized certain real property as the separate property of respondent wife in a postjudgment order following divorce. Appellant contended that Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.1, enacted while the appeal was pending, created a presumption that property held in joint tenancy was community property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent wife's mother testified that she wanted to give her real property to her married daughter alone, but, on the advice of her attorney, executed a joint tenancy deed to respondent and appellant husband. When the marriage ended in divorce, the trial court at first found that the residence was community property, but upon reconsideration, characterized it as respondent's separate property. On review, appellant challenged the finding on grounds that the mother's testimony was not weighty enough to establish an agreement and that Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.1, enacted while the appeal was pending, now compelled a characterization of the residence as community property. The court held that it lacked the authority to reweigh the evidence presented in the mother's testimony. The court found that a recent state supreme court decision on when &sect; 4800.1 became operative had created confusion. The court decided not to apply &sect; 4800.1 retroactively and affirmed the trial court's judgment that the residence was respondent's separate property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's finding that the residence given to respondent wife by her mother was respondent's separate property even though the deed conveying the property created a joint tenancy in respondent and her former spouse.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the inclusion of &quot;vex&quot; or &quot;annoy&quot; in the jury instructions was statutorily authorized by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 7(4) definition of &quot;maliciously.&quot; The court overruled defendant's contention that the jury instruction violated the doctrine of stare decisis because the cases defendant cited did not consider whether the intent to vex or annoy was a sufficient intent for sustaining a mayhem conviction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent trial court held petitioner attorney in contempt for refusing to represent an indigent defendant in a paternity case. Petitioner argued that he had never handled a paternity case, and that forcing him to represent the defendant was an unconstitutional denial of his right to equal protection of the law. The court granted certiorari and ordered the trial court to vacate its orders of appointment and contempt. The court reviewed the appointment under the rational relationship test because the right to pursue a profession was not a fundamental right for the purpose of invoking the strict scrutiny test. The court held that it was a denial of equal protection when the government charged the cost of a state function, conducted for the benefit of the public, to a particular class of persons. The court held that when the state prosecuted a paternity action against an indigent, it must bear the expenses necessary to comply with the provisions of the state and federal constitutions, which included the cost of counsel for the indigent defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, class of property owners, filed a writ of mandate and complaint against respondents, public officials, after appellants unsuccessfully challenged the adequacy of an environmental impact report, regarding consideration of possible sites for a new prison. The trial court ruled in favor of respondents. While appellants sought judicial relief through the appellate process, the state legislature passed a prison funding bill which exempted the proposed prison in question from compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The bill carried an urgency clause and became effective immediately after the governor's signature. Respondents filed a motion to dismiss the appeal as moot. The court held that the bill in question was constitutional and valid legislation, and it dismissed the appeal as moot. Because the immediate expansion of the prison system was necessary to protect public health and safety, and the means employed by the legislature were rationally related to the desired objective, retroactive application of the bill and elimination of CEQA compliance did not violate the due process and equal protection clauses under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the supreme court the Court of Appeals of California, First Appellate Division, Division Five was to reconsider defendant's petition for writ of habeas corpus to determine if the extension of his recommitment to prison as a parole violator pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 3057(c), was an invalid ex post facto punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought a writ of habeas corpus and contended that the extension of his recommitment to prison as a parole violator under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 3057(c), was an invalid ex post facto punishment. The court held that there were two elements for a criminal or penal law to be ex post facto: it must be applicable to the event that occurred before its enactment, and it must disadvantage the offender affected by it. The court found that petitioner was imprisoned for a crime that occurred prior to the statutory change that required additional custodial time for conduct that occurred subsequent to the initial incarceration. The court held that because petitioner's improper conduct occurred after the change in the law and because he was on notice that a future misbehavior could result in extra custodial time, the law was not an ex post facto punishment and denied his writ.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed this judgment because it found that the legislature intended the language of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.07 to be mandatory. Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.07(a)(3) prohibited the granting of probation to any person convicted of selling heroin who had previously been convicted of selling a controlled substance. Thus, the court held that &sect; 1203.07 was intended to eliminate a trial court's &sect; 1385 discretion to strike allegations or findings of a defendant's ineligibility for probation.

When respondent county clerk-recorder refused to process the applications on the basis of an insufficient residence address, appellants sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent to accept their applications. The trial court denied their petition. The court reversed this denial and held that appellants complied with applicable state registration requirements because the designation of a public park as a residence for voting purposes qualified as a place of fixed habitation, and so long as appellants actually resided there, they could register to vote in that precinct. The court also held that respondent's refusal to register appellants violated appellants' constitutional rights to equal protection. The court noted that the right to vote was a fundamental right and classifications denying it deserved strict scrutiny. Finding that respondent had not asserted sufficient grounds to justify its refusal to register persons establishing their home as the park at issue, the court remanded the matter so that the requested writ could be issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This petition was brought by petitioner taxpayers to challenge the establishment of roadblock sobriety checkpoints in several California counties, set up by respondent police department. At the time the petition was filed, most such roadblocks were only threatened, and petitioners sought to stay their operation. To determine whether such checkpoints were constitutionally reasonable the test was similar under both the federal and the California Constitutions. The court held that it had to balance the gravity of the governmental interest or public concerns served by the roadblocks, the degree to which the roadblocks advanced these concerns, and the severity of the interference with individual liberty resulting from the roadblocks. Though intrusive and burdensome to the public even when properly conducted, the degree of intrusion was justified by the magnitude of the drunk driving hazard and the potential for deterrence and detection. Petitioners having presented no showing that the checkpoints in issue violated these principles, the alternative writ was discharged and the petition for peremptory writ was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The peremptory writ of mandate sought by petitioner taxpayers to stay the operation of roadblock sobriety checkpoints by respondent police department was denied.

The court affirmed and held that the ordinance was an acceptable time, place, and manner regulation of peep show businesses because the governmental interest in regulating appellant for purposes of health, safety, and public welfare was unrelated to the suppression of free expression. The court held that the requirement of the ordinance that the interior of the booths not be partially or fully enclosed did not restrict the freedoms under U.S. Const. amend. I because there was no restriction on either the content of the pictures or their dissemination. The court rejected appellant's contention that the ordinance infringed on the right of their customers to engage in sexual conduct in partially or fully enclosed booths, under a constitutional right of privacy, because the government had a legitimate interest in seeking to prevent masturbation in locales outside of private homes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner electorate committee sought a preemptory writ against respondent court's order barring a referendum election on a municipal development freeway financing fee issue before real party in interest city under Cal. Gov't Code under &sect; 6648.3. The court denied the peremptory writ, explaining that the matter of major freeway financing was a subject of statewide concern to which the ordinary initiative and referendum processes did not apply. The court noted that it was only in matters of statewide concern that the legislature could be held to delegate a particular authority to a governing board to prevent application of the referendum process to disenfranchise the electorate. The court concluded that such circumstances existed in the present action because the electorate of real party in interest lacked power to enact the proposed ordinance when the freeway funding initiative was a matter of public concern, which was specifically entrusted to the authority of the city council under the statute. The court reasoned that the three large freeway corridors trisecting the state's second largest county was obviously a matter of statewide concern.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended the order was excessive in that it was based not only on the count to which she pleaded guilty or on the dismissed counts alleged in the information, but also on uncharged offenses as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a bookkeeper with a firm owned by the victim. Defendant was responsible for issuing company checks. She pleaded guilty to one count of embezzlement. As a condition of her probation, she was ordered to pay restitution to the victim. The victim produced 75 unauthorized checks made payable to defendant's husband's business. The trial court found that $ 20, 419 constituted the substantiated loss of the victim. Defendant contended that the restitution order made as a condition of probation was not authorized by her &quot;Harvey&quot; waiver. The court disagreed and found that the trial court specifically advised defendant and defendant specifically agreed that unfiled charges related to the case could be considered in determining whether to grant probation or impose sentence. Defendant also alleged that the restitution order, as a condition of probation, was unconstitutional in a variety of ways. The court disagreed. There was no denial of due process. Defendant then alleged that the restitution order was invalid because the trial court failed to make express findings that it was primarily intended to rehabilitate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee applied for and was denied a service-connected disability retirement under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 31720 by respondent county employees board of retirement. The trial court denied appellant's petition for a writ of mandate. On appeal, the court determined that respondent and the trial court had properly applied the amendment to Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 31720 when they tested for service-connected disability; the amended version of &sect; 31720 had semantic, not substantive, changes; and there was nothing in the record to indicate the trial court had not independently judged the evidence. The evidence, however, did not substantially support the superior court's findings that appellant's disability was not service-connected. Two of the three psychiatrists who were expert witnesses unequivocally stated that appellant's paranoid psychological condition was work-related. The third witness, notwithstanding a contrary report, provided testimony that clearly showed that appellant's condition arose out of and was substantially contributed to by his employment. The trial court judgment was reversed with directions to grant the petition for writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the appropriate test for disability was applied by the trial court and respondent county employees board of retirement, and the statutory changes had no effect on appellant employee's case. The evidence, however, did not substantially support the superior court's findings that appellant's disability was not service-connected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent taxpayers sought declaratory relief from an assessment procedure adopted by appellant tax assessor, in which he sought to reassess respondents' taxes at current values in accordance with Cal. Const. art. XIIIA, &sect; 1 and Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 52. Appellant contended Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 10 removed nonprofit golf courses, such as respondents, from application of Cal. Const. art. XIIIA, &sect; 2, thus the valuation rollback provision no longer applied. Additionally, appellant contended &sect; 52 intended to impact the assessment of golf courses. Respondents filed a complaint for declaratory relief. Both parties moved for summary judgment and the trial court granted respondents' motion. Appellant challenged the trial court's judgment. The court affirmed the trial court's decision and held that no conflict existed between the two constitutional provisions and therefore, appellant should have assessed respondents' taxes as he did in the past. The court reasoned that it agreed with appellant's contention that the intent of the legislature by enacting &sect; 52 was to impact the assessment of taxes, however, such intent was not achieved.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff eventually filed suit, alleging breach of express warranty, product liability, and fraudulent concealment. The trial court rendered judgment against defendant for compensatory damages, punitive damages, and a civil penalty; plaintiff was also awarded attorney's fees and costs. On appeal, the court found that a punitive damage award was proper, in light of defendant's intentional concealment from plaintiff of the high level of formaldehyde fumes found in the mobilehome, amongst other findings. The court also held that there was substantial evidence of defendant's willfulness to justify the imposition of a civil penalty under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1794, but also noted that plaintiff had in effect elected to waive punitive damages under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3294, by seeking the civil penalty. As plaintiff received both, she received a double recovery; the punitive damages award was ordered as stricken.</SPAN></P>

Defendant real estate company successfully moved for the admissions to be deemed admitted under Cal. Civ. Proc.

The court denied the petition for peremptory writ of mandate, holding that the Louisiana court lacked jurisdiction to redetermine custody under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA), because of the pendency of the custody proceeding here. The Louisiana decree was not entitled to full faith and credit under Cal. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an interlocutory decree of divorce between appellant wife and respondent husband, the trial court awarded the parties' condominium to respondent pursuant to a retroactive application of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.2, which provided for reimbursement of separate property contributions to the acquisition of community property in the absence of a written waiver of that right. The condominium had been respondent's separate property before he executed a quitclaim deed, during the marriage, transferring the property to appellant and respondent as joint tenants, and, thus, appellant had a vested property right in the condominium as community property. Appellant sought review and the appellate court reversed, holding that the retroactive application of &sect; 4800.2 constituted an unconstitutional deprivation of vested property rights without due process of law. Under the former law, a spouse presumptively received no reimbursement for separate property contributions, which were viewed as gifts to the community; whereas &sect; 4800.2 now required a written agreement. The old scheme was not unjust and plaintiff had no way to protect her interest upon retroactive application of &sect; 4800.2.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant real estate agent sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which denied his petition for peremptory writ of mandate directed at respondent real estate commissioner, which sought to set aside respondent's order revoking appellant's real estate license subject to his right to apply for a restricted license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent real estate commissioner adopted the administrative law judge's recommendation to revoke appellant real estate agent's license for dishonest dealing, but respondent modified the order to provide for the issuance of a restricted broker's license upon application. Appellant filed a petition for writ of mandate and an application of stay of administrative decision. The trial court found a sufficient showing of misconduct and denied the writ. The court affirmed the decision and held that Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 10177(j) use of the term &quot;dishonest dealing&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. The court held that there was substantial evidence that appellant had become a fiduciary when he agreed to accept and make the payments on behalf of a client as his agent. The court declined to require a finding of fraud or deception in order to sustain dishonest dealing in violation of &sect; 10177(j). The court held that respondent's decision revoking the license, but allowing a restricted license was not arbitrary, capricious, or patently abusive exercise of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment in favor of defendants and found the plaintiff's proposed exercise of eminent domain violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. Plaintiff sought review and argued that its exercise of eminent domain power was exempt from scrutiny under the commerce clause. Defendants argued that professional football was so completely involved in interstate commerce that acquisition of a franchise by an individual state or city through eminent domain would impermissibly burden interstate commerce. The appellate court found that plaintiff claimed authority to bar indefinitely defendant football franchise from relocating. Plaintiff's proposed taking of intangible property more than indirectly regulated interstate commerce. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment because the burden that would be imposed on interstate commerce outweighed the local interest in plaintiff's proposed exercise of statutory eminent domain authority over defendant football franchise.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs argued that the supplemental assessment provisions, &sect;&sect; 75.10 and 75.11, imposed new ad valorem taxes.

The appellate court reversed that portion of the trial court judgment that found &sect; 75.12 violated Cal. Const. art XIII, &sect; 1, because the legislature's decision not to subject certain property to supplemental assessment was not an exemption, as that the property would be assessed when it was sold. The appellate court otherwise affirmed the trial court judgment because the supplemental assessment provisions, &sect;&sect; 75.10 and 75.11, merely imposed a new timing mechanism for valuation and collection and did not alter the tax rate or impose new taxes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed that the supplemental assessment provisions were constitutional because the provisions merely affected the time at which the existing real property tax was calculated and imposed.

When S.B. 150 was enacted, it was discovered that the bill as adopted included &sect; 33.35 due to staff error. Although the state legislature alerted the state governor to the error, he signed SB 150 into law. The court held that &sect; 33.35, which received the necessary approval of the legislature and was approved by the governor, could not be impeached by extrinsic evidence that it did not genuinely reflect the will of the legislature. The court found that &sect; 33.35 amended existing provisions of the family planning act, but violated the single subject rule. Further, even if the court had agreed with respondents that &sect; 33.35 simply clarified funding arrangements for abortion and other services authorized under the family planning act, the court would have been nonetheless compelled to conclude that it impermissibly amended the act.

Harb. &amp; Nav. Code &sect; 491. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that appellant's claim was properly brought under the state vessel lien statutes and not federal maritime law because a federal maritime lien did not lie to obtain payment for construction of a vessel. The court determined that appellant was estopped from asserting a state vessel lien under &sect; 491 because appellant stated in a master carpenter's certificate, relied on by respondent owner and its financing bank, that it transferred 100 percent interest in the boat to the boat dealer, and was silent as to the existence of the lien. The court also found that respondent owner was a bona fide purchaser as he had no notice of the existence of the lien until appellant brought its action to foreclose on it. Respondent owner's purchase of the boat as a bona fide purchaser extinguished the lien. The lien was not enforceable until perfected by complaint and summons or by attachment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a dismissal after sustaining defendant's demurrer. Plaintiff appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the dismissal of the cause of action that measure K was unconstitutional because pursuant to Cal. Evid.

Respondent argued that its right of privacy was constitutionally protected and may be abridged only where there was a compelling public need. The court reversed and held that the right of privacy does not extend to exclusion of public from access to public trust lands. The court held that courts have liberally construed the purposes of public trusts to the end of benefiting all people of the state and appellant could add conditions to the permit that forced respondents to allow public access to the beaches.

On appeal, the court held that there was no justiciable controversy. Plaintiffs, as individuals, were not party to a surrogate parenting arrangement, but merely alleged that they, as attorneys, represented couples who were parties to such arrangements; they therefore did not have standing in this action and could not state a valid cause of action. Further, the standard for the granting of declaratory relief which was in the nature of ripeness and standing was well established. The controversy must be one that admitted of definitive relief by judgment within the field of judicial administration, as distinguished from an advisory opinion. The judgment must decree, not suggest, what parties may or may not do. The judgment was vacated and the action dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Respondent petitioned for a writ of administrative mandamus. The trial court issued a writ of mandate directing appellant to set aside its decision. On appeal of that order, the court determined that a conclusive case of marital status discrimination was made out when respondent stipulated that the husband was not considered for a decision because his wife worked in the same department. Once the discrimination was proven, the only remaining issue was the appropriate remedies to be afforded. The court stated that appellant was required to determine whether respondent established an affirmative remedial defense that the husband would not have been hired even absent the unlawful discrimination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In November 1980, judgment was entered in favor of respondents, financially interested parties, and against appellant, savings and loan association. Respondent demanded payment from appellants, which included the original judgment plus interest at 10 percent per annum from November 1980 to December 1983. Appellant argued the interest should have been 7 percent per annum. On respondent's motion, the trial court issued a writ of execution that computed interest at 10 percent per annum. At the time of judgment the legal rate of interest on unpaid judgments was 7 percent per annum. In July 1983, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 685.010, provided that interest on unsatisfied judgments should be 10 percent per annum. Appellant sought review. The court held &sect; 685.010, was not intended to act retroactively on those portions of unpaid judgments remaining unpaid on July 1, 1983. The court found the legislature clearly intended, from history pertaining to the legislation prior to &sect; 685.010, that the statute was not to be applied retroactively.

Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the second degree murder conviction. The court found that a vehicular homicide committed while intoxicated involved implied malice and was second degree murder if a person knew that his conduct endangered the life of another yet acted deliberately with conscious disregard for life. The court found sufficient evidence of implied malice. Defendant had consumed enough PCP to impair his physical and mental faculties. He drove at extremely high speeds for a lengthy period of time, creating a great risk to other drivers. He was aware of this risk due to his collisions and near misses with other cars and his deliberate avoidance of two pursuing police cars. He continued this driving even after the danger was demonstrated. The absence of a finding that defendant took the PCP knowing that he would later drive did not preclude a finding that at the time of the fatal accident defendant acted deliberately with conscious disregard for a known, life-threatening risk.

Civ. Code &sect; 5150 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner wife left Arizona with her children, two of whom were also children of husband, after a stay of 10 months, moved back to California, and filed for a legal separation. Petitioner claimed that husband was abusive and that she was unable to obtain an attorney in Arizona because she had no money of her own. Respondent trial court, after discussing the matter with the trial court in Arizona and having a hearing on the matter for which petitioner's attorney did not have adequate time to prepare, declined to exercise jurisdiction over the custody matter, pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA), Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 5150 et seq. The court, in reversing respondent, found that since petitioner had alleged the basis for a possible emergency situation, she should have been given a reasonable time to gather her evidence to prove her contentions. The court found that respondent abused its discretion in not permitting petitioner a reasonable amount of time before the jurisdictional hearing to assemble her proof on the issues of emergency, home state, and clean hands issues under the UCCJA.

The judgment's award of damages to the Bachs is reversed with directions that judgment be awarded in favor of all cross-defendants on the Bachs' federal civil rights cross-complaint.

The judgment's denial of injunctive relief to the neighbors on their cause of action for violation of the restrictive covenant is reversed with the direction that such relief be accorded.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Butte County (California) denied plaintiff county an injunction against defendant landowners to prohibit their use of a house in a residential zone as a law office; awarded defendants damages against cross-defendants, board of supervisors, a supervisor, office of the county counsel, and neighbors; denied defendants' request for attorney's fees; and denied cross-complainant neighbors an injunction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's denial to plaintiff county of injunctive relief against defendant landowners' use of a house for a law office. The zoning authorities did not abuse of their discretion. The regional welfare perspective did not apply as the zoning ordinance had no effect beyond municipal boundaries. Defendants acquired the property after the zoning ordinance was enacted, so plaintiff could not be estopped to enforce it against them. Defendants were not denied equal protection. Defendants' business use of the house was not, as required, limited to persons residing there. The court reversed the award of damages to defendants as contradicting a valid zoning ordinance and granted cross-complainant neighbors' motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The court also reversed the denial of injunctive relief to cross-complainants as there was no substantial evidence that changed conditions outside of the tract governed by the covenant made it inequitable to enforce the restrictive covenant. The court affirmed the award of attorney's fees to cross-complainants as their communications to zoning officials were not actionable and the claim against them was meritless.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the recorded conversations were inadmissible under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 636.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real party in interest landowners sought cancellation of the contractual restriction of use of their property under the Williamson Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 51200 et seq. Respondent city's cancellation was vacated by the California Supreme Court. In response, the legislature passed the window period cancellation provision of former Cal.

Appellants city resident and environmental groups sought declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of the window provision against respondents city and developers. Respondent developers sought summary judgment on the grounds that the window provision was constitutional. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal the court reversed because the provision was in conflict with Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 8. The court held that the provision's purpose was to allow termination of a Williamson contract where development was imminent, without concern for public interest.

Appellant sought review. The appellate court affirmed in part and reversed in part. It found that because the original subdivision was completed before the effective date of the Coastal Act, it was valid. The court found that the second subdivision of Parcel C was not exempt from the provisions of the Coastal Act, but the applicable one-year statute of limitations barred the request for additional civil fines and exemplary damages for the attempt to create it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating certain code sections of appellant city; Fullerton Municipal Code &sect; 7.130.010 (gambling for commercial purposes) and &sect; 7.125.010 (playing the game of panguingue for money). Defendant demurred to the complaint against her and claimed the ordinances were unconstitutional. The municipal court overruled defendant's demurrer and she sought relief by petitioning for writ of habeas corpus in the superior court. The superior court agreed the two ordinances were unconstitutional, issued its writ of habeas corpus and enjoined the city from prosecuting others under the same code sections. Appellant challenged the decision, and the court reversed the superior court's order issuing the writ of habeas corpus and declaring the ordinances unconstitutional. The court held that the ordinances on their face were constitutional because they regulated and prohibited only gambling conduct. The regulation of gambling was an appropriate exercise of local police power when not preempted by state law. Thus, the ordinances on their face, and by their plain meaning, withstood constitutional scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

Using the independent review standard, rather than substantial evidence review, the court held that balancing of the parties' competing interests showed plaintiff's words were not constitutionally protected because speech which resulted in disruption, materially interfered with school activities, or impaired discipline was not constitutionally protected against an employer's response. Further, the conduct standards under which defendant dismissed plaintiff were not unconstitutionally vague because their prohibitions were clearly defined so as to give notice and to preclude speculation on their meaning or differences on their application.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners installed a rock revetment along their coastal property to prevent wave damage without a coastal permit.

The homeowners filed a petition for a writ of mandate challenging the conditions. The commission sought injunctive relief and civil penalties against the homeowners. The superior court granted the writ of mandamus and denied the commission's request for penalties. The commission claimed on appeal that public policy favored allowing public access to shoreline areas and that the project was a new development under Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 30212(b) that was subject to reasonable regulation. The court agreed with the commission's claims. The court ruled that the commission's conditions were reasonably related to one of the objectives of the Coastal Act and that they were supported by substantial evidence in the record.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 13352 provided a mandatory minimum suspension for violation of its conditions. The court held that the statute did not violate due process because it was reasonably related to a proper legislative goal. Also, the strong legislative policy to rid the state's highways of drunk drivers justified any non-rebuttable presumption having a reasonable relation to the presumed fact that may have been created by the statute. Lastly, the court found that &sect; 13352(5) did not violate equal protection as applied in the instant case. The statute validly attempted to minimize the highway carnage caused by drunk drivers, as a class.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state entered the fiscal year without a budget and because there was no appropriation for aid for families with dependent children (AFDC), no payments would be made. Respondent coalition filed suit for a temporary restraining order (TRO) requiring appellant to pay AFDC funds from its general revenue until a budget passed. The TRO was denied, but the state supreme court issued an interim stay ordering the payments. After the budget passed, the petition was dismissed, and the trial court awarded respondent attorneys' fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1021.5. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment on two bases. First, the budget act restrictions on attorneys' fees did not apply to &sect; 1988 because the Budget Act of 1982 &sect; 4.50 excluded such fees from the restrictions except for Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1021.5. Second, respondent was the prevailing party and was entitled to attorneys' fees because the stay had the effect of a final judgment and provided the relief sought. The court noted that &sect; 1988 allowed attorneys to instigate suits where no damages occurred but fees were recoverable by statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the award of attorneys' fees to respondent coalition in respondent's action that resulted in an interim stay order that required appellant state to make AFDC payments from its general funds until a budget was passed. The interim stay had the effect of a final judgment and provided the relief sought; thus, under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, respondents were entitled to attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant elementary school district operated two elementary schools and sought to remove itself from the junior high school system operated by respondents, a high school district and superintendent, and open its own junior high school. The trial court issued a peremptory writ of mandate and held that the withdrawal election proposed by appellant was violative of state law and would disenfranchise a segment of voters. Appellant contended that its withdrawal election that would have only permitted the electors in appellant's district to vote was proper pursuant to Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 37085. The court held that &sect; 37085 required a vote among all the electors in respondent high school district, not just the electors that resided in both respondent high school district and appellant's district. Appellant argued that only its electors should be able to vote because if all the affected electors were allowed to vote then appellant's electors will be overwhelmed by the larger group. The court such an argument raised equal protection concerns and stated that there was not a compelling interest to exclude voters because of how they might vote.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of lewd and lascivious acts upon or with the body of a child under age 14 which violated Cal.

The court treated appellant's challenge as a petition for habeas corpus and held that appellant's convictions on counts IX and XIV were not barred for four reasons. First, the information was timely filed, and because the offense was the same when the limitations period was amended, count XIV was not barred. Second, because count X in the original information was timely filed, count IX as successor count was not barred. Third, because the first extension of the statute of limitations did not violate ex post facto laws, the second also did not because they were effective before the period expired. Fourth, the delay did not prejudice appellant's defense, the amendments were retroactive to all actions not time-barred, and appellant admitted that all matters were committed within the statutory period in his nolo contendere plea.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which denied his motion to vacate a stipulated judgment of paternity that had been entered more than six years earlier, on grounds that defendant had waived his right to challenge the validity of the judgment against him by having pled guilty to contempt charges, and because he had not shown &quot;due diligence&quot; in pursuing his legal remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant signed an agreement admitting paternity and agreeing to pay child support; the agreement became a court order. Plaintiff county later filed for a contempt order, alleging there was a delinquent sum of child support. Defendant pled guilty to certain counts of the contempt citation; he thereafter obtained continuance after continuance, until he filed a motion to vacate the judgment in light of intervening precedent. The intervening decision, with retroactive implications, held that paternity judgments were voidable if the alleged father was unaware that his rights would be waived by executing an agreement; the motion was denied. On appeal, the court accepted as true defendant's allegations in a declaration that he was not informed of his rights when executing the agreement, as plaintiff had not challenged those assertions; he thus had not made a waiver of his rights in relation to the judgment when he pled guilty to the contempt charges. Defendant had also exercised due diligence in his efforts to set aside the judgment, as the record showed that defendant's continuances were obtained with no protest from plaintiff. The order below was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant received a much-reduced sentence in return for a guilty plea. The trial court, however, conditioned the sentence and plea agreement on appellant's agreement not to appeal the trial court's earlier denial of appellant's motion to suppress search evidence. Appellant, contrary to the agreement, sought review. The court noted that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5(m) was an exception to the general rule that a defendant could not enter a plea of guilty conditioned upon retaining the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress evidence. The court also noted that the right of a defendant to appeal his conviction was purely statutory in nature. The court concluded that appellant could waive his or her statutory right to appeal the trial court's ruling on a suppression motion and that such waiver could be made a condition of a plea agreement. As long as the record established that the waiver was free, knowing, and intelligent, the court determined that it could be upheld as a part of the plea agreement; thus, appellant was barred from raising the search and seizure issue on appeal notwithstanding &sect; 538.5(m).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff ex-wife and defendant ex-husband challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California).

Plaintiff also appealed, alleging, among other things, that the trial court erroneously denied her arrearages for 10 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of plaintiff ex-wife and defendant ex-husband's divorce, none of the proceedings disposed of defendant's military retirement. Plaintiff alleged the military retirement was an omitted community asset subject to present partition. The trial court agreed and awarded her a 30 percent community interest. Defendant appealed the award. Plaintiff also appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in denying her arrearages. The court held that California courts had the power to award an ex-spouse an interest in the military retiree's pension; there was no complete federal preemption. The court held the trial court properly computed plaintiff's interest on defendant's gross retirement pay, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award plaintiff retroactive payments as inequitable, because defendant had provided sole support for the children and plaintiff did not contribute financially. The court reversed and ordered the trial court to award plaintiff her community property interest in defendant's gross retired pay, instead of net, between the date of filing her complaint and the date of judgment; in all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision in all respects except where it determined that the trial court erred in awarding plaintiff ex-wife her arrearages from the filing date of the complaint computed on the net, rather than the gross, benefits received. The court reversed and ordered the trial court to compute plaintiff's interest from the filing date based on the gross retired pay and to recompute the interest due.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owners appealed a decision of the Superior Court of Siskiyou County (California), which entered summary judgments in favor of defendants, Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), director of DMV, DMV agents, city, police chief, county, and sheriff, in plaintiffs' action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 alleging that defendants violated their U.S. Const. amend IV and due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) issued an order to seize plaintiff owners' trailer and car because they failed to pay registration fees. With the aid of officers from defendants city and county, defendant DMV executed the order. Plaintiffs filed suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 alleging that defendants, DMV, director of DMV, DMV agents, city, police chief, county, and sheriff, violated their U.S. Const. amend. IV and due process rights. The trial court granted defendants' motions for summary judgment. The court affirmed, first finding that defendant director was properly dismissed because he was not the director at the time of the seizure. The court next found that defendants DMV and DMV agents were entitled to summary judgment because the latter properly executed a valid seizure order. The court also found that defendant DMV agents were qualifiedly immune from suit. Further, the court held that defendants county, sheriff, and city were entitled to summary judgment because plaintiffs failed to identify any policy that deprived them of their constitutional rights. Finally, the court found that defendant police chief was entitled to qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>

In the absence of a special verdict or interrogatory stating the amount of economic damages, ordinarily we would be required to remand the case for retrial on the issue on damages.  However during oral argument counsel for plaintiff stated that the total economic damages may be considered as being $ 30,000, and counsel for defendants stated that such figure would be acceptable to defendants.  Accordingly, in order to conserve judicial resources, we shall simply modify the judgment and reduce it to the net sum of $ 243,600. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If plaintiff is not satisfied with such a modification and desires instead to retry the issue of damages, then plaintiff may petition this court, within the time to petition for rehearing, requesting that the case be remanded to the trial court for retrial on the issue of damages only.  Each party is to bear its own costs on appeal.<BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

The court found that, although defendants' proffer contained the names of witnesses who might testify and the purpose of the testimony, it did not give the precise testimony to be offered by either of those witnesses. The court modified the judgment, reducing the award of damages because the amount of damages for noneconomic losses exceeded $ 250,000, the limit set forth in Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3333.2.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the right to drive was not protected by a specific constitutional guarantee and a fundamental right was not adversely affected. While a minor was clearly entitled to the protection of due process of law whenever the state initiated deprivatory action, it was equally well settled that the due process rights of minors were not coextensive with those of adults. The court held that &sect; 13352.3 had a rational relationship to the legitimate goal of reducing fatal and injury traffic accidents involving youthful intoxicated drivers and that the statute was constitutional.

The court affirmed the lower court's judgment and held that acquittal of appellant crop duster in prior criminal proceedings did not bar the administrative proceedings through res judicata because in a criminal case the burden of proof was higher and different and consequently the issues decided were not identical. The court held that the statutes and regulations provided sufficiently clear standards to give fair notice of the proscribed conduct and the custom in the industry did not conform to the standard of care required in handling such a dangerous material. The court held that the duty to operate safely in the aerial application of pesticides was nondelegable and in view of the serious potential for disastrous results, and appellants' insistence that they needed only exercise minimal care, the decision of the agency was not regarded as a clear abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent homeowner sought a building permit to add a third floor. After appellant administrator denied the permit, respondent appealed to appellant city's board of permit appeals (board). The board decided in respondent's favor. During the pendency of the challenge, appellant city's attorney issued an opinion advising appellant administrator not to follow the decision. The appeal was ultimately resolved in respondent's favor, and the board's decision was affirmed. Respondent then sued appellants, administrator, city, and county, for damages. Appellants sought review after the lower court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment on the issue of their governmental immunity because appellant administrator had failed to perform a mandatory act. The court found that under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 815.6, a public entity was liable for injury proximately caused by its breach of a mandatory duty to be performed without exercise of discretion. When the board overruled a decision of appellant city's permit bureau and ordered issuance of the permit, the bureau was required to issue the permit as directed, regardless of any contrary opinion. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged her conviction, entered in the Superior Court of Fresno County (California), of offering to sell phencyclidine. Appellant contended error in the denial of her motion to exclude testimony, insufficiency of the evidence, and that the prohibition on probation and suspension of sentence for any person convicted of offering to sell phencyclidine constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged her conviction of offering to sell phencyclidine (PCP). She contended that the trial court erred when it denied her motion to have excluded testimony of her comment on having made good on a bad sale. However, the comment was relevant to appellant's intent and her knowledge of PCP and was, therefore, properly admitted. Its probative value outweighed any prejudice. She also alleged the insufficiency of evidence to have sustained a conviction. To have proved an offer to sell PCP, it must have been shown that appellant offered to sell the drug with the specific intent to make a sale. The evidence was sufficient to have constituted an offer. That no sale took place was a factor, but was not determinative. A reasonable interpretation of the evidence was guilt, and that the jury found so was within their purview. Appellant also argued that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.07(a)(6) constituted cruel and unusual punishment. However, having considered the degree of danger that PCP presented to society, the Legislature's classification of PCP dealings as serious crimes and its determination that all persons involved in its sale should have been denied probation were reasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment for offering to sell phencyclidine was affirmed. The evidence was properly admitted, as it was relevant and its probative value outweighed any prejudice, and there was substantial evidence of offer and intent to sustain the conviction. The sentence imposed had not constituted cruel and unusual punishment, as the legislature's concerns and actions were reasonable in light of the degree of danger presented.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant's petition for mandamus. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, and ordered the trial court to issue its peremptory writ of mandate directing respondent to reconsider the appellant's request for back salary. The court held that the failure to provide to the appellant, as a minimum, notice of the intent to terminate, with a statement of reasons therefor and with some opportunity for appellant to respond either orally or in writing constituted a violation of procedural due process and resulted in the deprivation of a fundamental property right of the appellant. The court found that there was no record before the court that appellant was an unsatisfactory employee, only that he was a disabled employee with a reasonable cause for his absence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant judgment debtor sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which denied appellant's motion to clarify the nature and extent of interest awarded on a judgment against him. Appellant challenged the compounded interest that respondent judgment creditor sought to assess under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3291 and Cal. Civ. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent judgment creditor made an offer to compromise which appellant judgment debtor rejected. The resulting judgment was greater than the amount of the offer to compromise. The trial court granted respondent's motion to add 10 percent interest from the date of the offer to compromise, pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 658.010(a). After receiving the principal and 10 percent interest from the date of the offer to compromise, respondent refused to mark the judgment satisfied, claiming that the interest under &sect; 658.010(a) was in addition to regular 10 percent judgment interest provided by Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3291. In reversing the judgment of the lower court, the court found that &sect; 658.010(a) interest was not to be compounded with the interest provided under &sect; 3291. Rather, it merely marked the beginning date at which interest could be added to the judgment. The court held that because Cal. Const. art. XV, &sect; 1 limited interest on judgments to 10 percent, this interpretation was consistent with the presumption that all legislation is valid and should be construed to avoid unconstitutional results.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court because the statute awarding interest where an offer of compromise was rejected and a subsequent judgment was awarded in a greater amount was not meant to be in addition to the standard rate of interest on judgments. Rather, this statute allowed a judgment creditor to begin assessing interest at a date earlier than the date of judgment, but nothing more.</SPAN></P>

They claimed that the ordinance violated equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 because it created two classes of peddlers without a reasonable justification. Appellants challenged the order that denied the injunction and this court affirmed. The ordinance was constitutional. A rational basis for the prohibition was articulated by respondent who showed that the statute was primarily concerned with the safety of all the users of the city streets and sidewalks. The argument that pushcarts were singled out when motorized carts could have been equally as hazardous was rejected because restrictions could have been imposed at whatever rate respondent chose. The record did not support the claim that this ordinance invidiously discriminated against those of Mexican ancestry as it applied to all pushcart vendors. The contention that the ordinance was an attempt by respondent to control a public nuisance had been waived and was not supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant automobile manufacturer challenged the decision of the superior court (California), which denied its petition for a writ of mandamus. The manufacturer asserted that appellee Department of Motor Vehicles, New Motor Vehicle Board had abused its discretion when it ordered the manufacturer to consent to the transfer of a car dealership.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer disapproved of the transfer of a car dealership. The real parties in interest, transferee and dealership, petitioned the board, alleging that the decision was unreasonable. The board adopted the findings of an administrative law judge, which held that the withdrawal of consent to the transferee was unreasonable and ordered the manufacturer not to withhold its consent. The manufacturer sought a writ of mandamus, which the trial court denied. The court reversed. The court found that the statutory scheme of the California Automobile Franchise Act (Act), Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 3000 et seq., failed to meet the criterion of due process that a tribunal must be impartial and not appear to have the likelihood or appearance of bias because the Act mandated the presence of car dealers on the board without any representation by the manufacturers. The court held that the manufacturer was entitled to raise the constitutional issue for the first time on appeal because it involved a pure question of law presented by undisputed facts, it fundamentally affected the validity of the judgment, and it entailed important public policy questions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court which denied the manufacturer's petition for a writ of mandamus seeking relief from a decision of the board, which found that the manufacturer's decision to disapprove of the transfer of a car dealership was unreasonable. The court remanded the case for further proceedings before a board acting without the participation of new motor vehicle dealer members.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mobile home buyers sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent Superior Court of Santa Barbara County to rehear their motion for summary judgment in their suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against the real parties in interest, mobile home park proprietors. Petitioners claimed that a park residency restriction for anyone under age 25 violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 51 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When petitioner mobile home buyers attempted to obtain a mobile home in a park operated by the real parties in interest, mobile home proprietors, petitioners were informed that their application had been rejected because of a policy not to allow anyone under the age of 25 to reside there. Petitioners brought suit and moved for summary judgment. Respondent trial court denied the motion, as a matter of law, on the grounds that Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 798.76 carved out an exception to the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 51, by permitting mobile home parks to exclude families with children. Petitioners request a writ of mandate. The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate that commanded respondent to rehear petitioners' motion for summary judgment. The court determined that it was unable to infer from &sect; 798.76 any intent on the part of the legislature to interfere with its longstanding goal of increasing affordable housing for the general population. Instead &sect; 798.76 carved out an exclusive right to draft age restrictions in a &quot;senior&quot; facility only. The policy of the real parties in interest was found to be arbitrary and in violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A peremptory writ of mandate was issued that commanded respondent trial court to rehear petitioner mobile home buyers' motion for summary judgment filed against real parties in interest, mobile home park proprietors. The court concluded that state law allowed mobile home parks to exclude children only where the facilities were reserved for senior citizens. The age restrictions imposed against petitioners violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act.</SPAN></P>

Following trial, the jury returned special verdict, finding no negligence on the part of plaintiff and assigned liability to defendant. The court then asked the jury to break down the lump sum award pursuant to supplemental special interrogatories. Thereafter, the court reduced the general damages amount under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3333.2, which placed a ceiling on noneconomic losses recoverable in an action for injury against a health care provider for professional negligence. Defendant appealed. Plaintiff cross-appealed, arguing was improper, once the jury had returned its verdict, to require a breakdown of lump sum award. On appeal, the court held although the proper procedure would have been to submit the interrogatories with the original verdict, under the circumstances the judgment was affirmed. Given uncertainty of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3333.2's constitutionality at time of trial, thorough discussion of the issue among the court and both attorneys, and fact that mandatory requirements of the section were complied with, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners contend that their complaint was still viable to the extent the new enactments do not answer their original objections, the city insists the complaint was premature or moot. The court granted a peremptory writ directing the lower court to vacate its dismissal of parts of petitioner's complaint and to enter an order denying the city's motion to dismiss. The court held that the complaint was not premature; it challenged the 1974 housing element which was then in existence, it does not suddenly become premature because new and different elements are later enacted. The court further held that the enactment of subsequent legislation does not automatically render a matter moot, that this issue may only be determined by addressing the original claims in relation to the latest enactment at a full adversarial hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court had erred in granting the prosecution's motion to discover defense materials because the statute that allowed the discovery, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1102.5, violated defendant's right against self-incrimination. However, defendant could not complain on appeal of the state's reference to the materials because he had not made a timely objection at trial. Although a recent amendment to Cal. Const. that allowed unlimited use of prior felony convictions for impeachment purposes had not gone into effect at the time defendant committed the charged crimes, the trial court's error in this regard was harmless because the other evidence of guilt was strong. Therefore, the court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of violating Cal.

The court observed that the repeal of &sect; 2955 coincided with the enactment of Cal. Com.

Noting that the repeal and enactment merely transferred the definition of mortgaged property, the court held that the information relating to possible mortgaged property was always available, and fair warning, as required by U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, rape, forcible oral copulation, kidnapping, and robbery. Special circumstances allegations were found true as to the murder, that a firearm was used in committing the offenses, that multiple murders were committed, and that defendant had not been free of custody for five years at the time the felonies were committed. Defendant alleged that the jury was not representative and that findings as to the felony-murder rule and the special circumstances were improper without intent. The court affirmed, holding that because defendant did not object to jury selection at trial, he could not raise the issue on appeal. The special circumstances findings were proper as to one of the victims, despite the trial court's failure to instruct on intent, because the jury's verdict necessarily required a finding that the killing was intentional. However, as to the other victim, because the jury could have found true the special circumstances, without finding intent, the special circumstances as to that victim was reversed. The trial court also erred in not using the sentencing statute in effect when the crimes were committed. The case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction on the basis that the jury was fully and properly instructed on the elements of murder, as well as the elements of murder by torture, and that there was no error in the court's instruction relating to aiding and abetting. The court held that defendant placed his specific intent in issue by putting forward a diminished capacity defense in relation to the special circumstances charge for torture murder, and that nothing in the factual record hinted at a lack of intent on defendant's part to torture the victim as he expressed his intent to put him to death. The court found that if a wrong instruction had been given, it was nonprejudicial as, beyond a reasonable doubt, had the jury been correctly instructed, it would not have reached a more favorable result based on the facts that defendant violently beat and tortured the victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, husband and wife, challenged the lower court's final judgment of dissolution. Before marriage, appellants signed a written agreement that wife's inheritance was her separate property, and the couple improved their residence with funds from wife's inheritance. The trial court found that the residence was community property and denied appellant wife a separate property interest in it. The court reversed and remanded on the issue of appellant wife's reimbursement. The court applied Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.2 retroactively and concluded that appellant wife was entitled to reimbursement for separate property contributions to the acquisition of the residence unless she waived it in writing. Retroactive application of &sect; 4800.2 did not violate appellant husband's rights under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 or Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, because appellant husband's marital rights were not contractual obligations. Further, the court found that the state could exercise its police power to divest appellant husband of a vested right in the family residence.

The project involved a $ 3 million tax allocation bond issue to effectuate the purchase of the property and the development. The bonds were to be repaid solely from tax increment funds.

The court held that Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 33678 exempted tax increment financing from the requirements of art. XIII B. Under &sect; 33678, the allocation and payment to redevelopment agencies of tax increments was not deemed to be a receipt of proceeds of taxes by the agency and was not subject to the appropriation limitations imposed by art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner ward of the court applied for a writ of habeas corpus and challenged the judgment of the Superior Court, Fresno County (California), which ordered him confined in a secure facility during non-school hours for his contemptuous disobedience of a lawful court order that he attend school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile court imposed a 48-hour period of confinement in secure facility for petitioner ward of the court's contemptuous disobedience of a lawful court order that he attend school. The juvenile court stayed the enforcement of the order to allow petitioner an opportunity for appellate review. Petitioner then applied for a writ of habeas corpus and claimed that a minor adjudged a ward of the juvenile court as a status offender under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 601(b) could not be punished for contempt by confinement in a secure facility during non-school hours. The court denied the writ and vacated the previously ordered stay. When Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;&sect; 601(b) and 207(b) were read as a whole, it was clear that the legislature did not intend to eliminate or restrict the inherent powers of the juvenile court to punish a &sect; 601 ward pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 213. The legislature intended to preserve intact the contempt powers of the juvenile court to enforce its lawful orders.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to strike the registration requirement which was denied by the trial court, and that denial was affirmed by the lower court. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment because the registration requirement for the offense defendant committed did not shock the conscience or offend fundamental notions of human dignity. The court held there was a rational basis for Cal Penal Code &sect; 290; to wit: a legitimate state interest in controlling crime and preventing recidivism in sex offenders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant grabbed the victim as she left a bank, put a gun to her back, shot her in the heart, and took her purse. Appellant was convicted of murder in the first-degree in that the murder was committed while appellant was engaged in the commission of a felony in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 189. Appellant was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2, appellant received a sentence enhancement of two years. Defendant was to serve the life sentence without possibility of parole and then the two-year enhancement. Upon reconsideration, the court affirmed the conviction but modified the sentence enhancement. The court held that giving conflicting jury instructions concerning the special circumstance of intent to commit murder was harmless error. Appellant's intent was established by the evidence, and it was not reasonably probable that a jury could have reached a different verdict based upon a proper intent instruction. While the sentence enhancement under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.5 was proper, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 669 required that appellant serve the two-year sentence before the indeterminate life sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Superior Court of Ventura County (California), which convicted him of six counts of issuing checks without sufficient funds for their payment in violation of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged on six counts of issuing checks with insufficient funds for their payment in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 476a. A jury convicted defendant of all six counts and the trial judge sentenced him to one year in the county jail as a condition of five years' probation. Defendant appealed and claimed that &sect; 476a was unconstitutionally vague because it did not prescribe the method to be used in formulating felony counts where a series of worthless checks exceeded $ 200. The court held that &sect; 476a was constitutional but that the offenses had to be listed in chronological order. Here, the six felony counts did not list the checks in chronological order but instead, in an order permitting each count to total a sum as close to $ 200 as possible. The court found that the information therefore charged six felony counts whereas counts charging checks issued in chronological order would only provide five felony counts and one misdemeanor count. The convictions were modified to reflect this and, as modified, were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment as modified to convict defendant of five felonies and one misdemeanor. The court found the statutory provision was constitutional but the trial court should have added the amounts of the worthless checks in chronological order, which is why the number, and type of convictions was modified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged the issuance of tax allocation refunding bonds by respondent Santa Ana Community Redevelopment Agency under the Community Redevelopment Law, Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 33000 et seq., which permitted the agency to take advantage of increased property tax revenues in blighted areas without an increase in the tax scheme. Appellant's lawsuit challenged the validity of the bond issue claiming that it exceeded the agency's appropriations limit and required voter approval under the Government Spending Limitation, Cal. Const. art. XIII B. Respondent demurred and the trial court granted summary judgment for respondent. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that, in Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 33678, the legislature had determined that redevelopment agencies' receipt of taxes pursuant to Cal. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 16, were exempted from art. XIII B. The court noted that art. XIII B was vague and uncertain as applied to funding methods of redevelopment agencies, but that &sect; 33678 was a legislative clarification of tax allocation financing which was neither arbitrary, unreasonable nor repugnant to the constitution.</SPAN></P>

The misdesignation did not make it impossible for the trial court to sentence appellant, and he was not prejudiced by the inaccuracy. The court held that Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for burglary after police arrested him a few blocks from a burglary in possession of virtually all of the property subsequently identified as stolen.

Defendant stated that he was studying photography but could not identify the school where he was taking lessons. Defendant stated that his father gave him the camera equipment and that he purchased the equipment for $ 20. Defendant was serving a prison sentence for burglary and robbery and was on pass from a state prison halfway house when he was arrested. Defendant was convicted and given an enhanced sentence pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.5(b). Upon review, the court affirmed the conviction but struck the enhanced sentence. The court held that defendant's actions prior to arrest corroborated his involvement in the burglary and that the trial court properly ruled that defendant's prior convictions could be used to impeach defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with petty theft with a prior conviction for petty theft in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 666. Defendant admitted the alleged prior petty theft conviction. Defendant was found guilty and sentenced to state prison for three years. He appealed and argued that the imposition of a three-year term of imprisonment for petty theft constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The court rejected defendant's argument because the facts did not entirely support defendant's analysis. The court held that proof of a prior conviction under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 666 raised a misdemeanor crime punishable by a fine or county jail sentence to a felony punishable by imprisonment. The court reversed the conviction because defendant was neither advised of his constitutional right not to admit his prior petty theft or informed of the consequences of his admission, as required. The court held that it was reversible error because it was reasonably probable that defendant might not have admitted the prior conviction had he been so fully advised. Thus, the court reversed the conviction because prejudice to defendant resulted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for petty theft with a prior conviction for petty theft because defendant was neither advised of his constitutional rights not to admit his prior conviction nor informed of the consequences of his admission. This was reversible error because it was reasonably probable that defendant would not have admitted the prior conviction had he been so fully advised, and defendant was prejudiced by the admission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant magazine sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which dismissed defendant's cross-action in libel and slander as a sanction for defendant's refusal to disclose the sources of an article it published which allegedly defamed plaintiff libelants who sought review of a judgment that they were public figures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant magazine published an article that alleged that plaintiff libelants were criminals. When plaintiffs filed an action in libel and slander, defendant cross-complained that plaintiffs defamed it. During discovery, defendant refused to reveal the sources of its story. In sanction, the trial court dismissed the cross-action. The trial court held against plaintiffs on the ground that, as public figures, they failed to prove malice. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal of defendant's cross-action but, in an unpublished portion of the opinion, reversed the judgment that plaintiffs were public figures. Dismissal of the cross-action was a proper sanction because, under Cal. Civ. Proc. &sect; 2034(b), defendant was answerable for its reporters in agency. Defendant had only a qualified right to keep its sources confidential. Use of a five factor balancing test led to the conclusion that defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. I had to yield to the public interest in the ascertainment of truth in legal proceedings. Neither Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1070, nor considerations of the sources' privacy barred narrowly-drawn disclosure provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of defendant magazine's libel cross-action because dismissal was a permissible sanction for defendant's refusal to disclose sources' identities as the privilege defendant enjoyed was qualified and subordinate to more compelling public interests. The court reversed the summary judgment entered against plaintiff libelants because they were not public figures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to four counts of robbery, one count of attempted robbery, and admitted two prior prison terms pursuant to a plea bargain.

The court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 2933's application to post-sentence imprisonment was constitutional and that defendant was not entitled to any credit for his pre-trial confinement. The court found that if there was any ambiguity in the imposition of consecutive sentences, the judge's clarification and transcript resolved the ambiguity. The court held that the &quot;double-base-term&quot; limit of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.1(g) was not an exception to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667's enhancement provisions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that state law pertaining to the implied warranty of habitability, Cal. Civ.

On appeal, defendant asserted, inter alia, that his vehicle came under the place of business exception to a permit per Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police stopped defendant and found a pistol in his boot and other guns in his glove compartment.

Penal Code &sect; 12025(a), (b) for carrying a concealed weapon on his person and carrying a concealed weapon in a vehicle, respectively. Defendant appealed the denial of his suppression motion and argued that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12026 was unconstitutionally vague and that his vehicle fell under the place of business exception granted by &sect; 12026 for the permit requirement. The court reversed on the basis that a hearing was required on the sufficiency of the evidence to support the flyer. However, the court held that &sect; 12026 was not unconstitutionally vague. The &sect; 12026 exception did not apply to defendant's vehicle. The court held that anyone reading &sect; 12026 would see that its exception for residences and places of business did not apply to vehicles used by every businessman that had to travel for business.

The court held that the statute under which defendant was convicted was not unconstitutionally vague. The court also held that the term place of business as used in the statute granting a permit exception meant a fixed location and did not apply to defendant's vehicle when used for bounty hunting.</SPAN></P>
