</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentencing by the Common Pleas Court of Summit County (Ohio) for engaging in organized crime in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.04, grand theft in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02, and gambling in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was an attorney who represented a man who conducted several purportedly charitable bingo operations. The profits from the bingo games were not restricted as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.09. The evidence showed that defendant knew of the scope of the operation, directed payment of profits to obtain a license in violation of the statute, and received attorney's fees from bingo profits. Defendant was convicted, and on appeal, the court reversed the conspiracy conviction, but affirmed the grand theft and gambling convictions. The court held that defendant could not be convicted for conspiracy as well as the underlying crimes because there was only one conspiratorial agreement and the same evidence was used to prove the conspiracy and the objects of the conspiracy. The court also held that the games did not qualify as charitable bingo, that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.04(A)(5),(C), (D) was not unconstitutional on its face nor as applied, and that the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of communications between defendant and his client because a third party was present during the communications, which prevented the attorney-client privilege from attaching.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of conviction as to organized crime ordered that the conviction for organized crime be dismissed with prejudice. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentencing as to grand theft and gambling.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the regulations that pertained to licensure of therapists were constitutional and otherwise valid. The court found that the various certifying boards had not colluded to violate antitrust regulations. The court determined that the investigator's conduct was questionable and that summary judgment as to him, in regard to his malicious interference with the therapist's work, was not proper. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment as to the Board and as to the investigator in all but the malicious interference charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction in that there was an absence of proof that the alleged victim was, as to defendant, a &quot;family or household member&quot; as required under &sect; 2919.25. Section 2919.25(D) defined &quot;family or household member&quot; to mean a spouse, person living as a spouse, parent, child, or other person related by consanguinity or affinity, who is residing or has resided with the offender.Defendant and the victim were the natural parents of a three-year-old son. Defendant had a key to the victim's house and had lived with her in that house intermittently over a period of three years. They slept in the same bedroom and defendant had purchased food, clothing, and furniture for the household. The court ruled that, under those circumstances, the testimony was sufficient to establish that the victim was to the defendant in the context of &sect; 2919.25, a person living as a spouse with him, and, thus, a family or household member.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff guardian of an incompetent person (ward) sought review of the decision of the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which granted the motion for summary judgment by defendants, a city and an individual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While on the way to a fire, defendants ran their fire engine through a red light and hit the ward's automobile broadside and drove it into a light pole. As a result, the ward suffered severe brain damage. The trial court sustained defendants' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the guardian claimed that the trial court erred in failing to find that sovereign immunity as established by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 701.02 was no longer justified, thereby causing the statute to be invalid. She further claimed that the trial court erred in failing to find that &sect; 701.02 was unconstitutional and void for violating Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 16 and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. On review, the court held that the guardian's reliance on Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16 was misplaced as it provided for the very immunity, which the guardian argued against. The court concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 701.02 had a rational basis in fact supported by substantial justification, as the immunity preserved for the operation of municipal vehicles was limited to the operation of police and fire vehicles during emergencies to save lives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employer challenged the decision of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which entered judgment, in favor of appellees, a decedent and an administrator of the Bureau of Workers' Compensation, recognizing a right of the decedent's widow and minor children to participate in the Workers' Compensation Fund of Ohio and awarding them statutory attorneys fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent, a 23 year employee of the employer, injured his back on the job while lifting a ladder. He was admitted to the hospital approximately one month later when his condition failed to improve. Although he was discharged, his condition worsened. He was again admitted one month later, where it was eventually determined that he had suffered a heart attack. He was scheduled for coronary bypass surgery but died before the surgery. On appeal, the employer contended that the trial court improperly overruled the motion for a directed verdict at the close of appellees' case and at the close of all the evidence. The court reasoned that there was only one determinative issue to have been submitted to the jury, whether a substantial acceleration of the decedent's death from coronary disease was proximately caused by his job-related back injury. The court held that the trial court erred in denying the motion for a directed verdict because appellees' proof failed to show that it was more probable that the decedent's death from coronary disease was accelerated by his industrial injury, than from all other causes which might reasonably have been inferred from the established set of facts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the action for further proceedings according to law.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant had no standing to object to evidence secured from the person of his co-defendant on the basis that the evidence was obtained as a result of an invalid arrest of the co-defendant. The court further found that defendant's right to cross-examine a missing witness was not violated because defense counsel in this re-trial was also defendant's counsel in his first trial and had cross-examined the witness at that time. The court also found that because there was evidence which removed any imputation against the veracity of an accomplice, the accomplice's testimony could be considered as to the elements of the crimes charged against the defendant. The court finally found that because defendant offered evidence as to self defense, which would, if accepted by the trier of fact, constitute a complete defense to all substantive elements of the offense charged, the trial court did not err in failing to charge the jury on the lesser and included offense of voluntary manslaughter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants separately appealed from the judgments of the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County (Ohio) that convicted them of various drug related offenses. The court consolidated the appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants and others were named in an indictment, which spanned seven years and was the culmination of an investigation of a drug importation and distribution operation. Defendants were jointly tried and convicted. On appeal, the court reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded. Regarding the search warrants at issue the court held that the affiants reliance on information supplied from the records of other law enforcement agencies was permissible to establish a basis for probable cause. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.04, which prohibited engaging in organized crime, was not unconstitutionally vague because the proscribed conduct was clear, definite, and required scienter. The indictment contained multiple conspiracy counts. The court held that &sect; 2923.04 was in effect a conspiracy-type offense, and determined that some of the counts merged into others. Therefore, the court did not reach the question of double jeopardy or multiple punishments. Remand was necessary where the jury instruction regarding the definition of an accomplice caused prejudice. The instruction was insufficient for a person of ordinary intelligence to understand the definition as including a co-conspirator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court variously affirmed and reversed the trial court's judgments. The court remanded for further proceedings, as regarded prejudice due to an erroneous jury instruction and as regarding the trial court's error in sentencing for the convictions left standing under the former drug laws. The court ordered a special mandate, directing the trial court to carry the judgments into execution.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the juvenile contended that the Ohio Youth Commission was not equipped to provide the treatment required for his rehabilitation. The court determined that the question of whether or not the Ohio Youth Commission was a proper facility could not be properly determined upon the record. The court held that the decision of the trial court to commit a juvenile to the legal custody of the Ohio Youth Commission was specifically permitted by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.355(D). The trial court followed the law, and upon the commitment of the juvenile to the legal custody of the Ohio Youth Commission, the jurisdiction of the juvenile court terminated. The court further held that when a juvenile court replaces the parents of dependent children with an agency in harmony with law, the appeals court does not function as an overseer of the actions of the agency in carrying out its responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the landowners' action did not question the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance, but rather argued that the board's decision was unreasonable in view of the factual considerations involved. The court found that the trial court erred in using a constitutional standard or test in the decision making process. The court determined that the question presented was factual or evidentiary in nature, and therefore did not necessitate the burden of proving constitutional impropriety.

Subsequently, a complaint was filed seeking to award permanent custody of the children to the county welfare department because the parents had allegedly failed to visit the boys or provide financial support. The court reversed the trial court's award of permanent custody to the department. The court held that the finding that the children were neglected and dependent was not against the manifest weight of the evidence or contrary to law. Further, the statute under which custody was awarded, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.04(C), was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. However, no notice of the effect of granting permanent custody was given to the parents as required by &sect;&sect; 2151.28(A) and 2151.353, and no separate dispositional hearing was held in the manner prescribed by &sect; 2151.35. Thus, the court ordered that the children should remain in the temporary custody of the department and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant argued that an award for disability benefits was not restricted by the 6-year limitation under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52. The court disagreed, holding that it was incumbent upon a claimant to apply for benefits within the 6-year period in order to invoke the continuing jurisdiction of the workmen's compensation commission. The court held that the common pleas court properly granted the bureau's motion to dismiss. The claimant also argued that the statute violated equal protection because there was a 10-year period for total disability and only a 6-year period for partial disability. The court found that all injured workers, so long as they filed their first claim for benefits within two years after the injury, had six years from the date of injury to file a claim for additional benefits. The fact that some workers eventually received certain types of compensation which, in turn, allowed them to invoke the continuing jurisdiction of the commission for 10 years of the date of the last payment of such compensation, did not create a separate and suspect class. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A trucking business had parked certain trucks loaded with overseas containers on the street in front of the premises. During the night, defendant and several others broke into the trucks, unloaded the containers, and stole the merchandise. Defendant challenged his conviction for breaking and entering, and the court affirmed. The court held that because defendant failed to raise the issue of the constitutionality of the statute under which he was convicted, &sect; 2911.13, in the trial court, he waived the issue, and there was ample evidence to support the finding that defendant used force or stealth to gain entrance to the trucks. It would have been unreasonable for the jury to conclude that the prosecution proved all the elements of criminal trespass without also proving all of the elements of breaking and entering. Thus, an instruction on the lesser included offense of criminal trespass was unwarranted by the evidence, and the trial court was correct in refusing to give such an instruction to the jury.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2903.03 on each count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court did not adhere to the statutory array procedures of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2313.16, 2313.17. However, the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's challenge to the array as defendant failed to show that the excused jurors were not entitled to be excused or that the remaining jurors did not possess the requisite qualifications to be jurors. The photographs used by the forensic pathologist during his testimony were properly admitted as the photos had probative value to identifying defendant as the murderer and to confirming the State's theory as to how the murder was committed. As the evidence did not eliminate the possibility, or even the probability of his involvement, defendant had no alibi defense and was not prejudiced by the trial court's failure to instruct on alibi. The State presented sufficient evidence from which the jury could have concluded that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Although the trial court's instruction on voluntary manslaughter shifted the burden of proof to the defense to prove extreme emotional stress, the error was harmless in view of the evidence in the case. Any remaining assignments of error were dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested after telling the victim, a 14-year-old boy, &quot;you pin me again and you're going to eat my meat,&quot; while wrestling in defendant's home. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court committed reversible error when it overruled his motion to dismiss, that he was entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal because the State did not meet its burden of proof, and that the trial court committed reversible error when it found defendant guilty because there was no evidence that the solicitation inflicted injury on the victim or provoked him to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace. The court reversed, concluding that (1) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.07(B) was enacted pursuant to the fighting words exception to the First Amendment and was a legitimate exercise of the State's police power; (2) the record contained no evidence to support a finding that &quot;eat my meat&quot; was a phrase that meant to engage in sexual activity, as that phrase was used in &sect; 2907.07(B); and (3) the record contained no evidence that defendant's statement inflicted injury on the victim or was likely to provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee appealed from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which affirmed a decision of defendant industrial commission denying him the right to participate in the workers' compensation fund for the reason that his application for compensation was not filed within six years from the date of the industrial injury, as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee sustained an injury to his back. Pursuant to an industrial claim, his medical bills were paid. Eight years later, he filed an application for determination of the percentage of permanent partial disability. In the interim, the employee was temporarily totally disabled upon several occasions as a result of the injury, during which periods he received sick-leave benefits. The commission and the trial court found that the employee was barred from participation in the workers' compensation fund by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52. On appeal, the employee contended that he was denied equal protection of the law. The court held that &sect; 4123.52 was not in itself, unconstitutional, but that the trial court applied it to the circumstances of the case in a manner which was violative of the equal protection clause. The court found no rational basis for determining the right to participate in the fund with respect to injured employees solely upon the basis of whether an employer had continued to pay an employee regular wages during the period of disability. The court concluded that the employee was not limited to filing such application within six years from the date of injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant alleged that he had fulfilled all of the requirements for a license under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4732.09, 4732.15(B)(2), other than residency. He contended that the residency requirement was unconstitutional on its face and as applied. He further asserted that the Department had a mandatory duty to grant him a license. The trial court granted the Department's motion to dismiss on the ground that the applicant had an adequate remedy at law because he had the remedy of an administrative appeal. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by dismissing the complaint pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6). The complaint alleged the existence of a duty on the part of the Department and the absence of a plain and adequate remedy at law. It was unclear from the complaint whether the Ohio State Board of Psychology had denied the application. If no such order had been issued, then the applicant did not have an adequate remedy at law because he could not perfect his appeal to the common pleas court under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12. The court noted that the case could be decided by summary judgment under Ohio R. Civ. P. 56(C) upon entry of such an order by the Board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted on a count of felonious assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser-included offense of aggravated assault, and the lower court sentenced him to four years' probation with various conditions. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that Ohio R. Crim. P. 11 was substantially complied with regarding the acceptance of defendant's guilty plea. As to the alleged defectiveness of the indictment, defendant did not raise his objection to the charging instrument before the lower court. Thus, the court was not required to consider the alleged errors, which were waived. Defendant's conviction was also consistent with the law, including the definitions of &quot;deadly force&quot; and &quot;physical harm.&quot; These terms defined the degree of an assault's seriousness under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.12. The language of the law was reasonable, did not give unfettered discretion to law enforcement officials, and gave notice to defendant of the criminal standards of conduct. Defendant's constitutional challenge was therefore overruled. Finally, it was within the lower court's discretion to limit defendant's contact with the victim as a condition of probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was involved in a collision with another vehicle, he was charged with violating &sect; 432.08. He appeared in the trial court before a referee. After he refused to sign any papers, the referee entered a plea of not guilty for him. He proceeded to another courtroom where a bailiff set a trial date of November 28, 1978 for him and he signed a notice to appear. On November 27, 1978, he filed a motion for an arraignment. The next day he appeared before the trial court pursuant to the notice to appear. At that time, the trial court found that he was properly advised of his rights by the referee and denied his motion for arraignment. The trial proceeded with defendant pro se and he presented two witnesses. He was found guilty on the charge. On appeal, the court held that the referee properly entered a not guilty plea for defendant pursuant to Ohio Traffic R. 10 because he &quot;refused&quot; to plead. The trial court properly proceeded with the trial because counsel had not entered his appearance in the case. The maximum fine the trial court was able to impose under &sect; 432.08 was $ 100, and it had no power to order defendant to make restitution for the damage to the other vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An undercover agent purchased illegal drugs from defendants. After defendants were indicted, the agent's deposition was taken by the State by videotape while the agent was in the hospital. Defendants' counsel was given 24 hours notice, but he arrived late, and his request to reopen the deposition was refused. Defendants were convicted, and they appealed. The court reversed, holding that, although &sect; 2925.03(A)(7) was not unconstitutional, the notice to defendants' counsel of the taking of the deposition was unreasonable under Ohio R. Crim. P. 15(C). Despite the fact that the witness was suffering from a fatal illness, speed was not paramount, and defendants were denied the right to confrontation. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.59 did not apply so as to permit the introduction of defendants' other acts because nothing indicated that those acts showed a distinctive methodology or modus operandi constituting probative evidence. However, the trial court correctly refused to delete references to photographs, and the prosecutor did not violate Ohio R. Crim. P 16(D). It proper to allow the testimony of the State's witnesses and to refuse to qualify defendants' witness as a fingerprint expert.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A city enacted a referendum related to its water supply. The Board found that it failed to comply with the requirement of Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 3501.38, requiring that it was signed by 10 percent of the appropriate electorate and filed with a county board of elections. Thereafter, the Board ordered that the city was required to implement a program of fluoridation of its public water supply. On appeal, the court upheld the order and ruled that the referendum petitions did not meet the requirement of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 611.13 because it did not designate the political subdivision in the county and adjoining counties served by the water supply. The court stated that even if the referendum could somehow be considered of having the effect contemplated by &sect; 6111.13, it was not clear from the record that the majority of the qualified electors rejected fluoridation. There was no indication in the record that the number of electors rejecting fluoridation constituted the requisite majority required by &sect; 6111.13.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city enacted legislation for street improvements. Ordinance 77-23 was enacted to provide an exemption for paying part of all of the assessments to certain abutting property owners based on the owners' annual income. The owners filed an action alleging that Ordinance 77-23 was unlawful, discriminatory, capricious, and unconstitutional on its face. The trial court found that Ordinance 77-23 unfairly discriminated against the owners and that it failed to meet due process requirements. The trial court then enjoined the city from enforcing Ordinance 77-23 against the owners. The city appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the city exceeded its power in enacting Ordinance 77-23. The court explained that the city had no authority to grant a partial or complete exemption from an assessment for street improvements. Ordinance 77-23 was an unconstitutional usurpation of the power granted to the Ohio General Assembly under Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 2 to determine what shall be exempted from taxation.</SPAN></P>

The Ohio Supreme Court reversed on the ground that defendant was not personally before the trial court when she was sentenced and remanded the case for re-sentencing. On remand, defendant filed a motion for discharge, alleging she was not timely tried, which was overruled. Defendant then appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by the trial court of disorderly conduct and appealed. She argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2971.11 was an unconstitutional regulation of free expression under the provisions of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, that the section was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and that the trial court erred in overruling her motion for discharge. Upon review, the court held that, by failing to object during or before trial, defendant was precluded from asserting her motion for discharge in the re-sentencing remand. As to defendant's attack on the constitutionality of &sect; 2971.11, the court ruled that the statute was not facially unconstitutional by reason of overbreadth nor was the court persuaded that it was unconstitutionally vague. The court stated that the statute's use of the language &quot;fighting words&quot; did not require persons of common intelligence to guess as to its meaning or application. The court concluded that everyone should have some realistic notion of what constituted unwarranted and grossly abusive language and that there was no merit to defendant's argument that her conduct did not tend to cause a breach of the peace.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father was incarcerated after a conviction for involuntary manslaughter, and the mother had trouble caring for their four children. The trial court found the children were neglected and awarded temporary custody to the Board. The children were placed in foster homes. The Board filed an action that sought permanent custody of the children. At the hearing, the father, who was still incarcerated, testified, and his family members testified they were willing to care for the children. The trial court awarded permanent custody to the Board and the father appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. The trial court properly determined the dependency as of the date of the filing of the complaint, and there was no abuse of discretion in the finding that the best interests of the children were served by the permanent placement with the Board. Evidence supported the trial court's decision, and the father was provided due process of law. The consideration of the best interests of the children and the finding that there was a greater probability of harm to the children by remaining with the parent than with terminating parental custody avoided an allegation of vagueness in &sect; 2151.04(A).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested on multiple charges of aggravated robbery. During the pretrial procedure, he entered pleas of &quot;not guilty&quot; and &quot;not guilty by reason of insanity.&quot; He also filed a motion to suppress identification evidence, which was denied. During trial, medical testimony was introduced tending to support the insanity plea. The trial court instructed the jury that while the prosecutor bore the burden of proving each and every essential element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt, defendant had the burden of proving the insanity defense by a preponderance of the evidence. Defendant objected to that instruction, stating that such burden infringed upon his right to due process. On appeal, the court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05, which placed the burden of proof on defendant with regard to affirmative defenses, was constitutional. Because the defense of insanity was an affirmative defense, the trial court properly placed the burden on defendant with regard to that issue. The trial court did not err by admitting the photo array testimony into evidence because, under the totality of the circumstances, the procedure was not unnecessarily suggestive.</SPAN></P>

P. 56.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's conviction for aggravated robbery and felonious assault were affirmed on appeal. A further attempted direct appeal was dismissed. Appellant then filed a petition for postconviction relief, asserting that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at his trial. The trial court dismissed the petition upon the State's motion for summary judgment under Rule 56. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court was not required by the Fourteenth Amendment to appoint counsel to represent appellant in his postconviction proceedings. In addition, there was no longer any Ohio statutory right to appointment of counsel in postconviction proceedings. The court also held that the trial court's use of the summary judgment procedure to dismiss appellant's petition without a hearing was proper. The trial court could properly have determined that there were no genuine issues of material fact as to the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. Defense counsel filed a notice of alibi at trial, called an alibi witness to testify, litigated a motion to suppress evidence, and requested special jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Bedford Municipal Court (Ohio), which convicted her of assaulting a police officer, petty theft, and resisting arrest, for which she was sentenced to 60 days imprisonment plus a $ 500 fine for the assault, 30 days imprisonment plus a $ 250 fine for the theft, and 10 days imprisonment plus a $ 250 fine for the resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred by not dismissing the petty theft, because she did not intend to deprive the store of any items; that her arrest was illegal and she was acting in self-defense; that her punishments were cruel and unusual; and that the record did not reflect that the trial court considered the factors for sentencing under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.22. The court determined that the incident arose after defendant got into a dispute with a store's clerk, during which she grabbed merchandise in the store, left the store with the items, and was shortly thereafter stopped in her car by the arresting officer, with whom she fought while affecting her arrest. The court held that under the definition of &quot;deprive&quot; in North Randall, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 642.01(c), there was sufficient evidence to support the theft conviction, and her arrest and fight with the arresting officer was not in self-defense. The court also held that her sentences were not so excessive as to shock the moral sense of the community, and she did not meet her burden to include the trial court's findings with regard to the sentencing factors in the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff union stewards appealed a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, Ohio, which granted defendant state hospitals' motion for summary judgment in the union stewards' action alleging violations of U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV, the Ohio Constitution, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5119.01, 5119.03, 51109.05 and 5123.141, and a master union agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The union stewards contended in their complaint that they were duly elected under a master agreement between a state mental health department and a state civil service union and that the agreement covered two state hospitals. Their claim was that the superintendents of the two hospitals wrongfully refused to permit the union stewards to represent union members at one of the hospitals. The trial court disposed of the claims that were based on statutory violations and violations of the Ohio Constitution. However, the claims based on violations of the United States Constitution and the master agreement were not resolved. Thus, the trial court's order granting the hospitals' motion for summary judgment under Ohio R. Civ. P. 54(B) did not terminate all of the claims and was subject to revision at any time before entry of judgment. Consequently, the order appealed from was not a final judgment and was subject to dismissal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, however, the court upheld defendant's conviction for two counts of aggravated burglary. Specifically, the court first held that although the trial court erred in overruling defense counsel's objections to the line of questioning of an assistant prosecutor, the court noted that it had no difficulty on the basis of the record presented in the case in finding that the error was harmless, in light of the testimony of defendant himself. Secondly, the court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred by instructing the jury as to the law with regard to aiders and abettors. Instead, the court held that, to the contrary, a review of the trial transcript convinced the court that the testimony was replete with the evidentiary fundament, which required the trial court to correctly charge the jury on the law relating to aiding and abetting. Lastly, the court held that there was substantial, credible, and probative evidence as to each of the essential elements of the crimes charged.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 5123.18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee city's action to stop &sect; 5123.18 from taking effect was consolidated with a similar action filed by appellee neighbors of the proposed &quot;family home.&quot; Other parties intervened. The trial court found that a &quot;family home&quot; was not a family use within the meaning of the Columbus, Ohio, Zoning Code (Code); that the city was exempt under &sect; 5123.18(G) from the zoning-overriding provisions, &sect;&sect; 5123.18(D) and (E), because the Code allowed discretionary variances and &quot;family homes&quot; were dormitories, which were permitted in other residential districts; and that &sect;&sect; 5123.18(D) and (E) were unconstitutional. Appellants challenged those findings and urged that the Code was unconstitutional. Affirming, the court upheld the trial court's first two findings and did not decide whether &sect;&sect; 5123.18(D) and (E) were unconstitutional because the city was exempt from them. The court held that the Code was not unconstitutional because it did not prohibit developmentally disabled persons from living in a single family residential district, so long as they were part of a single family; the court's ruling did not condemn them to mass institutions; and the association could have sought a variance.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the court first rejected the driver's argument that &sect; 4511.191(C) was not complied with in that an implied consent form was not read by the arresting officer to the driver in the presence of one other officer or civilian police employee. Instead, the court pointed out that a police dispatcher signed the implied consent form as a witness. Secondly, the court rejected the driver's argument that the Bureau failed to meet its burden of corroborating the testimony of the arresting officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a change in nursing home licensing requirements, the former administrator's license was revoked because she had not passed a required examination and because she violated the Ohio Revised Code and the Ohio Sanitary Code. In the former administrator's action to challenge the revocation of her license, the common pleas court determined that the examination given to the former administrator was discriminatory with regard to age and race and that the department of health had improperly determined that the former administrator had violated the law. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment in part, finding that the court held that the trial court erred in determining that the test was discriminatory because an expert's opinion that the test had a disproportionate impact was insufficient to prove a discriminatory purpose. In affirming the judgment in part, the court determined that the trial court properly found that the law and regulations regarding nursing home licensing were lawfully applied to the former administrator; although she had an excellent administration record, the State was justified in adopting licensing regulations to protect the elderly.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The officer waived his argument that &sect; 505.491 was unconstitutional because he did not raise it in the trial court. The testimony of the two women with whom the officer was involved was sufficient to support the finding of gross immorality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted in Allen County for aggravated murder, pled no contest, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The judgment accepting his guilty plea was reversed. When the case returned to Allen County, the prosecutor moved for a change of venue to Madison County, which was granted. Defendant pled guilty to aggravated murder, which was accepted, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief that asserted improper venue. The conviction was vacated and remanded to Allen County. The court reversed the common pleas court and held that the aggravated murder conviction was proper because defendant had waived the issue of venue. The common pleas court should not have set aside its acceptance of defendant's guilty plea. A plea of guilty admitted the venue of the court. This was true even where venue was improperly laid in an indictment. The provisions of Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(C)(2)(c) were scrupulously adhered to, and there was no question that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his rights. Defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to a trial by jury at the locus of the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), entered upon a jury verdict, convicting him of three counts of permitting drug abuse, in violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for permitting drug abuse. Later, he was indicted on other charges and was held in jail until his trial on the drug charges more than 90 days later. His motion for discharge on speedy trial grounds under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71 was denied. The evidence at trial showed that, on multiple occasions, defendant's minor children sold hashish out of their home, sometimes in defendant's presence. Defendant was found guilty and he appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that, because his pre-trial detention was due to other charges as well as the drug charges, the triple count provision of &sect; 2945.71(D) did not apply and his right to a speedy trial was not violated. Defendant lacked standing to attack Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.13(B) on vagueness grounds and the statute did not encompass constitutionally protected conduct so as to be impermissibly overbroad. There was sufficient evidence that defendant knowingly permitted the hashish to be sold out of his home so as to support the convictions and he failed to show prejudice resulting from the omission of proposed cautionary instructions to the jury.</SPAN></P>

The arresting officers observed in plain view a knife and handgun in defendant's car. A line-up was held and the victim identified defendant as the assailant. His motions to suppress were overruled. Defendant was convicted and he appealed.

A warrantless search of defendant after his arrest during the booking procedure for inventorying purposes was lawful and items discovered during that procedure that belonged to the victim were admissible at trial.

Code Ann. &sect; 3109.04.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One year after the grandparents were given custody of the minor child, the mother filed a motion for an order granting her custody. In denying her request, the trial court found there was no change in the circumstances of either the grandparents or the child and that the evidence did not establish that the best interests of the child required a modification of custody. The mother contended that the trial court failed to find that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.04 was unconstitutional as applied to third-party custody situations and failed to properly apply &sect; 3109.04. The court held that &sect; 3109.04 was valid and constitutional. There appeared to be sufficient evidence to support the finding that custody to neither parent was in the child's best interest based upon the factors set forth in &sect; 3109.04(C), which applied to the commitment of a child to a relative. However, because the referee's report concerned itself primarily with whether there was a change in circumstances under &sect; 3109.04(B), rather than a determination of the best interests of the child pursuant to &sect; 3109.04(C), the court remanded for a determination of the best interest of the child pursuant to &sect; 3109.04(A) and (C).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a decision by the common pleas court (Ohio), which convicted him of receiving stolen property on a plea of guilty and sentenced him to six months to five years. Defendant claimed that the relevant statute was unconstitutional, that the indictment failed to charge an offense, that the imposition of a felony sentence was cruel and unusual punishment, and that he was denied the right of allocution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stolen property was a credit card, and after he was convicted of a fourth degree felony, defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.51 was repealed by implication on the passage of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.21, which criminalized the misuse of credit cards. After the plea was entered, the court proceeded to sentencing without addressing defendant personally or offering the opportunity to present evidence in mitigation. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.71 constitutionally imposed a felony penalty on defendant's conviction, noting the legislative rationale that the harm resulting from possible future use could far exceed the actual worth of the card. The court rejected defendant's repeal arguments, finding that the misuse of credit cards statute was not so irreconcilably in conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.51 that the two could not be harmonized and that receiving stolen credit cards and misuse of credit cards were distinct offenses. The court found no merit in the cruel and unusual punishment argument, and it found that the trial court's noncompliance with Ohio R. Crim. P. 32 mandated a remand for the sole purpose of resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment as to sentencing, affirmed the remainder, and remanded the case in part for the sole purpose of resentencing with costs to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was arrested and charged with forgery. The trial court provided for petitioner's release from custody, but required the payment of bond and petitioner's aunt to co-sign the bond. Petitioner filed an action in habeas corpus arguing that the requirement of the co-signature was unconstitutional. The court agreed. The court held that the constitutional provision for bail stated with some exception that all persons were bailable by sufficient sureties and that excessive bail was not to be required. Ohio R. Crim. P. 46(C) provided for several lesser degrees of assurance of a defendant's appearance than a bail bond with sufficient solvent sureties, one of which was the appearance bond in a specific amount with a 10 percent cash deposit. This required no sureties under the rule, the assurance of appearance being provided by the cash deposit and the potential financial liability. The court found that the trial court created a hybrid by its order, which had the effect of delegating one individual alone the power to deny release. The court held that the requirement for a co-signature constituted an unconstitutional restriction upon the right to bail with sufficient sureties.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01(A). He was acquitted of two other counts. Following a mitigation hearing, defendant was sentenced to death. In a prior journal entry, the court reduced his death sentence to life imprisonment, consistent with recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested after he was informed of his Miranda rights. He later made a taped statement implicating him in the slayings. On appeal, he argued it was error to deny his motion to suppress because he was denied access to counsel during in-custody interrogation. However, evidence presented at the suppression hearing sufficiently supported the denial of defendant's motion. Defendant waived his right to counsel until he was asked to make a taped statement about the slayings. A court majority found that appointed counsel provided defendant with effective assistance. He next argued that he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial as defined by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2945.71-.73. The court disagreed, finding no evidence that the delay was unnecessary. The court also rejected his argument that the jury should have been sequestered before the case was submitted for deliberation. Five issues related to Ohio's capital punishment statutes were rendered moot when defendant's sentence was reduced. His final claim was that his due process rights were violated by the number of members on the grand jury. The court disagreed, holding that Ohio R. Crim. P. 6(A) controlled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, two truck stops and their managers, appealed from a judgment of the Wood County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which granted plaintiff, the State of Ohio, a permanent injunction against defendants that ordered that the real property and personal property under their control not be used for the purpose of lewdness, assignation, or prostitution in any manner in the future.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State, in an effort to clean up a perceived problem of prostitution in truck stops, filed an action against four separate truck stops that were in the same area and their managers, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.02. The trial court determined that defendants were maintaining a nuisance, issued a temporary injunction, compelled defendants to post bonds to continue operations, and gave them time to correct the problems. The trial court then issued permanent injunctions against the maintenance of a nuisance on the property, continued the bonds, and taxed defendants $ 300. Two of the truck stops and their managers appealed. The court reversed the judgment. The court found that the State failed to provide sufficient evidence of the general reputation of the businesses. Sexual activity for hire carried out in privately owned vehicles temporarily parked on the truck lot, conducted without the knowledge or permission of the owner or lessee, was not sufficient proof of nuisance for a prima facie determination of nuisance pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.05.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, decreed that all temporary and permanent injunctions against defendants be dissolved, dismissed the complaint against defendants, and assessed costs against the State.</SPAN></P>

However, the court held that nothing in the record revealed that defendant's trial was conducted in a trial atmosphere that had been corrupted by press coverage. Further, the court held that of all of the pre-trial publicity that existed, none constituted editorialization of the news respecting the case before, during, or after the trial. Therefore, the court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request for a change of venue. Defendant further argued that the trial court erred in allowing interrogation by the state, upon claimed surprise, to refresh the recollection of a hostile witness. However, the court determined that there was no error. Defendant finally argued that the trial court erred in informing prospective jurors of the offenses with which he was charged. The court held that there was no abuse of discretion in informing the jurors of the offenses charged before the presentation of evidence when later instructions were given.

XVIII, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; lf, an initiative election was held to abolish the city's charter. After the charter was abolished, a second initiative election was held, and the vote abolishing the charter was repealed. Thereafter, an action was brought challenging the second vote, and after the second vote was deemed unconstitutional, appellants sought review. Upon review, the court held that there could be no pathway of return to charter government except through compliance with the express constitutional provisions of Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 8. The court held that while the people of a municipality had the power to initiate a proposal to repeal the municipality's charter, the adoption of a charter was not governed by the general provisions of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; lf but instead, was covered by the specific, express constitutional provisions of Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 8. Consequently, the court held that Ohio Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The oil company sought to convert one of its automotive service stations located within the city to a self-serve facility and accordingly applied for a building permit. When the building commissioner denied its permit, the oil company filed a writ of mandamus to compel its issuance. A limited writ of mandamus was granted ordering respondents to act on the oil company's application, to reduce all decisions to writing, and to specify a reason for each decision. The court further specified that all objections omitted would be deemed waived. The planning commission approved the granting of the special use permit subject to certain conditions, but recommended not to approve the building plans because they did not comply with the codified ordinances of the city. The oil company then filed a motion for supplemental order seeking a final writ ordering the permit be issued and that Dayton, Ohio, Ordinance No. 1976-150 be declared unconstitutional. The court concluded that the oil company was entitled to the building permit because there was no proposed change in the basic use of the property and found the ordinance unconstitutional because it conflicted with Ohio Rev.

A peremptory writ of mandamus was filed to compel the board to abide by the city's charter and only place on the ballot the three regularly nominated individuals, arguing the board lacked authority to incorporate any changes into the language of the city's charter. The court issued the writ of mandamus, holding that the action of the board incorporating into the city's charter a new method of selection and imposing upon the city a privately chosen candidate by an unauthorized committee was not lawfully justified. The court concluded that there was no provision in the city's charter for the existence of a nominating committee, and there was no authority in the charter for the filling of vacancies on an election ballot.</SPAN></P>

The city's charter did not contain any authority for the board of elections to substitute the relator's name for the candidate who withdrew from the general election.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city council passed several ordinances pertaining to the development of certain urban renewal property. The council president refused to sign the ordinances because he was not satisfied with the procedural or the substantive validity of the legislation. The court issued a writ of mandamus ordering the council president to sign the ordinances. The city's charter, as well as rules of order governing the council, required the council president to sign any ordinance passed by the council. The council president was not granted any discretion in performing the procedural duty. If the council president was granted authority to refuse to sign an ordinance, he would have an unchecked veto power over legislation passed by the council. The council president's only concern was whether the ordinances were indeed passed by the council. The council president did not have the power to refuse to sign the ordinances based on his belief that they were illegal. His duty was purely ministerial. Mandamus would lie to compel the performance of the ministerial act of signing ordinances.</SPAN></P>

It was common knowledge that the word pound as used in normal commerce throughout the United States was the avoirdupois pound. The scale used was inspected, tested and sealed. Even though the national conference on weights and measures handbook required minimum gradations of 20 pounds at law enforcement weigh stations 50 pounds gradations were permitted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city enacted Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance 365.05, which required landlords to submit an application for a certificate of occupancy accompanied by a fee. The landlord brought an action to have the ordinance declared unconstitutional on the ground that the fees were not reasonably related to the city's costs in inspecting and licensing the landlord's apartment. The landlord claimed that the ordinance was arbitrary and discriminatory because it paid more in fees for its multi-building apartments than a landlord with more units in a single structure. The court disagreed and affirmed the finding that the ordinance was constitutional. The court held that regardless of the disparity in fees paid by single-structure applicants and multi-structure applicants, the fee was reasonably related to actual costs of inspection. The court held that even though the time spent inspecting fewer units in multi-building apartments was less than the time spent inspecting more units in one building, the classification was reasonable because inspections were done and files kept on the basis of individual structures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of felonious assault. The trial judge imposed a penalty of a $ 1,000 fine. Two days after the prosecutor filed his petition, defendant paid the fines. The prosecutor argued that the sentence was void because it was unlawful and contrary to the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.11, which required a mandatory jail term. The trial judge contended that because defendant paid the fine, it no longer had jurisdiction over defendant, and to impose a second penalty would place defendant twice in jeopardy. The court granted the writ of mandamus. The court held that (1) where a trial court made an unlawful order of suspension of execution of a sentence in a criminal case, mandamus was a proper remedy by which to compel such court to set aside and vacate its order and compel execution of the original sentence, (2) a trial court had no power to substitute a different sentence for that provided for by the statute or one that was either greater or lesser than that provided for by law, and (3) to the extent that the sentence of the trial court failed to follow the statutory mandate, it was void, and jeopardy did not attach for the second time.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's argument was based upon interstate transfers of prisoners and not upon any constitutional right. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2963.30 referred to a return of a prisoner where trial was not had on indictment. The condition was plainly not applicable to defendant's case where the trial was completed and the final order was delayed for briefs after a bench trial. Defendant delayed the final order further by additional post trial motions. Defendant was not denied any applicable statutory right. The time of delay after decision and before sentencing in view of all the circumstances did not constitute an unreasonable delay that would activate a constitutional right. The trial court expressly found that the defense of entrapment was not substantiated. The court rejected defendant's argument that mandatory sentencing was unconstitutional or that the legislature, by providing for actual incarceration, invaded the separate power of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that an auditor verbally allowed an extension of the 60 day period for collection and preparation of a &quot;dear customer&quot; letter, which was designed to give some proof of the use for which the equipment was put. The letters of usage marked &quot;farming&quot; were accepted, but the letters marked &quot;logging for sale&quot; were rejected. Subsequent examination of the logging equipment determined its use to be exempt. The board held that the &quot;logging for sale&quot; items were not sufficiently prepared as evidence to sustain the taxpayer's burden of exemption. The court disagreed with the board's conclusion as to the paucity of evidence of exempt use. The court held that the combination of the auditor's remarks, the advertisements describing the equipment, and the &quot;logging for sale&quot; letters was sufficient to exempt all of the items returned by customers marked &quot;logging for sale.&quot; Therefore, the court held that the board's ruling was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for trafficking in drugs. On review, the court reversed. Defendant's constitutional rights were not impaired by an entry of a not guilty plea prior to obtaining counsel. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by determining that a juror, who had read part of a newspaper article about defendant, was not influenced. The State's failure to disclose negative fingerprint analysis could have been remedied by a continuance and/or testimony by the person who performed the test. Defendant refused the remedies. The court reversed because the trial court erred in permitting cross-examination as to &quot;other criminal acts&quot; of defendant and the subsequent admission of the tape-recorded conversations. Motive was not a material issue. Intent was not an element of the crime. Thus, &quot;other acts&quot; testimony was inadmissible. Both the crime charged and the evidence of other acts took place between the same parties, concerned the same type of transaction, and occurred within a reasonably short period of time. The probability of prejudice to defendant was glaringly apparent. Moreover, there was no limiting instruction despite numerous and constant objections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant called the homeowner for the purpose of seeking a real estate listing. The homeowner had previously placed her name on a list indicating that she did not want to be solicited by real estate brokers. Thereafter, defendant was convicted of violating Cleveland Heights, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 749.04, which prohibited home solicitation. On appeal defendant argued, among other things, that &sect; 749.04 created a discriminatory classification against real estate brokers and salesmen. Specifically, she contended that the ordinance treated one type of service enterprise, real estate, different from others, and was therefore in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction. Classification of different groups by statute was not per se unconstitutional. As long as the classification had some reasonable relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose, the classification would be upheld. The ordinance at issue in was part of a legislative attempt to prevent blockbusting in the city; hence, there was a rational basis between the purpose of the ordinance and the restrictions placed on real estate brokers and salesmen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The real estate broker was convicted of practicing home solicitation in violation of &sect; 749.04. On appeal, he contended that the statute was unconstitutional. The real estate broker argued that the statute created a discriminatory classification against real estate brokers and salesmen. The basis of the real estate broker's appellant's argument was that the ordinance treated one type of service enterprise, real estate, different from others, and that it was therefore in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court stated that classification of different groups by statute was not per se unconstitutional. As long as the classification bore some reasonable relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose, the classification would be upheld. The court found that the statute supported the legitimate governmental interest of preventing blockbusting, which was defined as the practice of inducing property owners to sell because of the rumored or actual advent into the neighborhood of a member of a racial, religious, or ethnic group.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners contended on appeal that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment based on a neighboring landowner's case because the assessment legislation was arbitrary and discriminatory on its face and in failing to grant a hearing or notify the landowners that no hearing would be held on the summary judgment motion. The court affirmed the judgment. The court concluded that reasonable minds could only have come to one conclusion, adverse to the landowners, noting that evidence on several of their contentions had not been submitted by affidavit. The court observed that whether a hearing would be held on a motion for summary judgment was a matter within the trial court's discretion, and it stated that a party should not rely on the fact that a hearing would be conducted because the only evidence that could be considered in making a determination on the motion was that set forth in Ohio R. Civ. P. 56(C), which had to be submitted prior to the date of hearing. The court concluded that R. 56 had not been violated and that the landowners were not prejudiced by the trial court's failure to notify the parties that no hearing would be held.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought review of a judgment of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which granted defendants' motion to dismiss an indictment against them for engaging in organized crime on the grounds that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants attacked the constitutionality of the organized crime statute in the trial court on the grounds that it was both overbroad and vague. Under the language of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.04(C), any offense committed for the purpose of gain involving five or more persons and done on a continuing basis was elevated to a first-degree felony, regardless of the magnitude of the underlying offense. Also, the requirement that the offense be committed on a continuing basis was not sufficient to limit the application of the statute to established criminal operations. The statute included within its scope those persons who might work for or provide services to a syndicate while engaged in lawful activities. Thus, the statute was overbroad and in conflict with the Due Process Clause. In addition, because &sect; 2923.04 failed to provide an adequate standard by which the legality of an activity could have been determined, the statute was vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct on the lesser included offenses of aggravated murder, that the death penalty as applied to his case constituted cruel and unusual punishment, that a material element of the specification on the offense of aggravated robbery was omitted from the indictment, and that the trial court erred in admitting evidence that defendant committed aggravated robbery two days prior to the offense for which he was on trial. The court affirmed the judgment and remanded the cause. The court observed that the parties engaged in a good deal of discussion of the lesser included offense question, and it stated that if defense counsel desired to preserve an objection to the charge as given, he should have so stated. The court noted that Ohio's statutory death penalty scheme had been found unconstitutional. The court found that the co-existence and relationship of the two counts of the indictment compelled the conclusion that the specification related to the aggravated robbery of the victim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tracts had previously been under county zoning. The landowners contended on appeal that the trial court erred in ruling that the resolution as applied to their property was unreasonable, arbitrary, and bore no rational relation to public health, morals, and safety, overruling their motion for directed verdict, failing to apply the proper burden of proof, and ruling that the property must be used as a single-family residence. The court affirmed the judgment. The court stated that it was able to assume under the circumstances that the trial court applied the proper standard in the fact-finding process. The court found that the facts were sufficient to shift the burden of proceeding to the landowners and that the trial court properly overruled the motion to dismiss. The court observed that the area was clearly residential and stated that &quot;spot zoning&quot; of a single lot to something else was unreasonable and arbitrary and did not bear a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare. The court noted that the order of the trial court did not establish a zoning classification, but simply maintained the status quo until the township board acted.</SPAN></P>

In a statement given to the police, defendant asserted a self-defense theory. When arraigned after his arrest, defendant pled not guilty by reason of insanity. At his arraignment on an indictment, defendant simply pled not guilty. The trial court overruled defendant's motion to file a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. Under Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(H), defendant was required to enter plea of not guilty by reason of insanity either at the time of arraignment or before trial. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court caused him not to have a fair trial in violation of his constitutional rights. Defendant did not raise the constitutional questions at the trial level and, thus, waived them. Defendant was tried according to the accepted procedure for the type of case, and no established procedural rights were denied to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the issue of whether the judge erred when he ruled the ordinance unconstitutional and failed to impose the mandatory minimum jail sentence was an issue properly raised on appeal by leave of the court and not by extraordinary writ. The court further found that while sentencing within the perimeters set forth by the appropriate provision of the ordinance was required of the trial court, where the sentencing provision was ruled unconstitutional by that same court, its duty to sentence according to that statute was nullified. Therefore, the court held that whether the judge erred in ruling the ordinance unconstitutional was an issue involving the exercise of the judgment or discretion of the trial court for which a writ of mandamus was not available to control. The court concluded that a discretionary right of appeal was a sufficiently plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law because until leave to appeal was sought and denied, a remedy in the ordinary course of the law existed which was adequate to afford the review the city sought.</SPAN></P>

The Bureau of Workers' Compensation agreed to pay the claimant's related medical expenses. The claimant then filed an application for temporary total disability benefits. The application was denied on the ground that the claimant was paid wages by his employer during the period of disability. The Bureau subsequently ceased paying the claimant's medical benefits under the six-year provision of Ohio. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52. The claimant filed a motion in which he claimed that his receipt of wages in lieu of benefits served to toll the six-year provision. The Commission disallowed the claim. The claimant appealed, and the trial court sustained his motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that the six-year limitation applied only where no &quot;compensation&quot; had been paid for total disability. The court determined that that the term &quot;compensation&quot; included wages paid by an employer to a totally disabled employee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A trial was held, and evidence taken by stipulation and of at least one witness after a plea by defendant of not guilty. The trial court then, apparently sua sponte, after submission and on consideration of the evidence, chose to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the statute involved was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that it had to determine the power of the State to appeal. A trial having been conducted and the case submitted, the court concluded that jeopardy had once attached. The court held that the issue of guilt or innocence was tried by the trial court with jurisdiction to try the offense which had been properly charged and his fate had been placed in the hands of the trier of fact. The court reasoned that the fact that the dismissal was based upon an issue of law was not determinative. The court held that defendant had been exposed to the danger of punishment under the statute. Therefore, the court held that any action by the court would have only been advisory in nature and could not affect a retrial of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was injured while working for a city. He filed a claim with the Bureau. The claim was certified as valid and all his medical bills were paid by the State. The Ohio Industrial Commission determined his permanent partial disability to be 34 percent. However, based upon the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.57(B) (Amended 1963), the Commission found that it could not award the employee benefits because the award would exceed 100 percent when taken together with other percentages of permanent partial disability awarded to him for pre-1963 injuries. The trial court held that the percentages of permanent disability resulting from other injuries could not be added to the percentage of disability resulting from a present injury. The court ruled that the amendment of &sect; 4123.57(B) applied prospectively and therefore only affected the employee's injuries that occurred after the amendment's effective date. The court noted that the employee's post-1963 injuries resulted in 71 percent permanent partial disability. The court reasoned that because the employee had not yet reached the 100 percent limitation he had no standing to challenge the amended statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for one court of aggravated burglary under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.11 and one count of aggravated murder with specification under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01. At his arraignment he plead not guilty to both counts. He later appeared before the trial court, accompanied by his court-appointed attorney, and entered pleas of guilty to murder under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.02, a lesser included offense of aggravated murder, and to aggravated burglary under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.11. Prior to accepting his pleas, the trial court once again informed defendant of his rights. Defendant appealed, seeking to void his guilty pleas. The court affirmed because defendant's argument that his guilty plea, which he claimed was based on fear of the death penalty, should have been thrown out because the death penalty statute was later declared unconstitutional lacked merit. In addition, the trial court fully complied with Ohio R. Crim. P. 11 in informing defendant of his rights. Defendant entered his plea after careful consideration, he had the advice of competent counsel, and that the pleas were voluntarily made.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that adoption was a special statutory proceeding and that the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure were not applicable. The court held that the natural father was only entitled to notice of the filing of the adoption petition and of the time and place of hearing. The adoption statutes did not require service on the natural father of a motion to amend the petition. The father also contended that the trial court erred in finding that his consent was unnecessary to the adoption. The court noted that the father had been ordered to pay $ 160 per month as child support. The record indicated that, during the one-year period prior to the filing of the petition, the father did not comply with the order. The record did not reflect any good cause for failure to comply with the order. One payment during the year preceding the filing of the petition, in compliance with the judicial decree, could not be said to be substantial compliance with the decree.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the member. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case. The court found that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the grounds that the letter in question was inadmissible. The court stated that the trial court prematurely made the decision that the physician's proof would be barred by operation of law, which is a decision that could not be made pursuant to a Ohio R. Civ. P. 56(c) proceeding. The court found that the letter was inadmissible because documents available from original sources could not be used in any civil action merely because they were presented during proceedings of a credentials committee.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court had previously denied the husband's action for divorce based on gross neglect of duty and extreme cruelty but had granted the wife's crossclaim for alimony, which included a lump sum alimony award and a division of the parties' assets and liabilities. The husband filed a subsequent action for divorce based on the parties' two-year separation. The wife responded and sought permanent alimony. The court granted the divorce but denied the wife's claim for additional alimony. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that alimony awards for a fixed amount were not modifiable by a subsequent divorce decree where continuing jurisdiction was not expressly retained. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3105.18 authorized the trial court to determine property rights during a marital separation. The prior order was not a continuing order for periodic payments, rather it was in the nature of a settlement of the parties' assets and liabilities. The disposition of the husband's prior action for divorce did not operate as res judicata under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The physician applied for membership to the professional staff of the hospital. The hospital was private and had a code of bylaws that provided a procedure for the appointment of professional staff. The board rejected the physician's application for active staff membership. The physician appealed the decision, but the board reaffirmed its decision after a meeting. The physician filed an action against defendants for monetary damages and injunctive relief. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion. The physician appealed. The court affirmed, holding that it could not substitute its judgment for the board's decision. The court explained that the private hospital had adopted non-discriminatory criteria for the appointment of hospital staff and it followed its procedure in denying the physician staff privileges. The court also concluded that there was no evidence that defendants conspired to interfere with the physician obtaining staff privileges. Further, the physician failed to set forth sufficient facts to establish a claim entitling him to relief under the immunity statute in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.25.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landowner filed an action against defendants, a city and its council, for a declaratory judgment that the council's vote resulted in the passage of a zoning ordinance. The city and the council sought review of the order of the Ohio common pleas court, which granted the landowner's motion for partial summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner agreed to sell his property for commercial development. The city's planning commission proposed a change to the percentage of land for supermarket use in the property's district. The council voted for the planning commission's proposed change and voted against the zoning ordinance. The council claimed that the trial court erred in finding that its vote constituted an enactment of the ordinance and that the ordinance was passed as of the date of the trial court's judgment. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court's judgment. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.12 required a unanimous vote to deny or modify a zoning commission's recommendation, that a unanimous vote was not achieved, that the failure to comply with &sect; 519.12 constituted an adoption of the ordinance, and that the ordinance was adopted. The court held, however, that Cleveland Heights, Ohio, Charter art. VIII, &sect; 2 provided that the ordinance became effective 30 days after its enactment and that the trial court erred in holding that the ordinance became effective as of the date of its judgment entry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant stood next to his accomplice while the accomplice shot a victim during a robbery. Defendant, inter alia, attacked the imposition of the death penalty as unconstitutional and contended that the admittance of certain evidence was erroneous. The court upheld defendant's conviction but reversed his sentence. The court found that the current Ohio law for the imposition of the death penalty was unconstitutional. Accordingly, it reduced defendant's sentence for aggravated murder to life imprisonment under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.02(A), 2929.03(A) as though defendant had not been charged with a specification of an aggravated circumstance. In addition, the court found that evidence was presented to show that defendant, as an accomplice, personally intended to cause the death of the victim. Defendant's purpose to kill could be presumed from the conspiracy to commit a dangerous criminal act, where a natural, reasonable, and probable result of the act was death. Also, the failure to give defendant his Miranda warning prior to a custodial investigation was not reversible error where no statements from that interview were used at trial and no statements were inculpatory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part the judgment of the trial court. Defendant's conviction of aggravated robbery and aggravated murder was affirmed but his sentence for aggravated murder was reduced from death to life imprisonment, to be served consecutively to the sentence imposed for aggravated robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a joint jury trial, the three defendants, one of whom was a local judge, were convicted of murdering the judge's wife. A fourth person was charged but was granted immunity for his testimony. On appeal, the court held that defendants received a fair trial. Any error that the trial court may have committed was not prejudicial to defendants, and the evidence presented by the state clearly established the defendants' guilt; thus, affirmance was mandated under Ohio R. Crim. P. 33(E)(5). The statement made by a defendant's girlfriend to an FBI agent was admissible over the hearsay objection as declarations of co-conspirators and as being reliable, probative, and necessary for a just determination of the issues under Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(5) and the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. There was no error on part of the lower court in failing to grant separate trials because the objectionable evidence of certain tapes would have been admissible against all defendants in separate trials. The prosecutor's comment was not so prejudicial to defendants as to require a reversal because the court charged the jury that no inference could be drawn from defendants' failure to testify.</SPAN></P>

The claimant, argued on appeal, that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that he was entitled to recover if the insurer established a mere agreement or arrangement to share in the purchase of food or pay rent. The court affirmed, concluding that (1) the trial court did not err in submitting to the jury for determination the issue of whether the claimant was a paying guest or a renter; (2) the trial court did not err in failing to charge the jury, that in order to render a verdict for the insurer, the insurer had the burden of proving that the insured was motivated in permitting the claimant to reside with him by the expectation of an actual or potential material benefit and that the claimant gave the insured consideration in excess of the expenses the insured incurred.</SPAN></P>

Because the car had no rear lights, the officers stopped it. The officers could see empty beer cans and a knife in the backseat of the car. The juvenile claimed that the empty cans had been there for a week and that he did not know the knife was there. The juvenile court found that the juvenile had violated rules of the park district and adjudged him to be a delinquent. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that the power of the metropolitan park board to make rules regarding the park was not an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. The court found that the search of the car was permissible under the plain view doctrine. The court decided that the circumstantial evidence was not enough to prove that the juvenile was in possession of alcoholic beverages, because he had presented a possible theory of innocence. The court found, however, that the trial court did not err in finding that the juvenile did possess the knife.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Common Pleas Court, Cuyahoga County (Ohio), where he was convicted of aggravated murder with specifications that the aggravated murder was committed while defendant and a co-defendant were committing an aggravated robbery and an aggravated burglary, and was part of a course of conduct in which they purposely attempted to kill another victim. Defendant's co-defendant was tried separately.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court wrongly removed a juror for cause solely because he expressed a disapproval of capital punishment. The court disagreed and noted that the trial court permitted other jurors who were against capital punishment to serve on the jury and that the dismissed juror had expressed grave doubts that he could maintain fairness and impartiality. The court also rejected defendant's challenges to admission of a fingerprint card and a set of latent prints found on a coffee can at the scene of the crime. Defendant waived the objection to the fingerprint card, and the connection between the coffee can and the scene of the crime had been established. The trial court's alibi instruction incorrectly called alibi an affirmative defense, but found that the error was harmless. The court rejected defendant' contention that he could not be sentence for aggravated murder consecutively to aggravated robbery and burglary, because they were lesser included offenses. The victim of the murder was not the same as the victim of the aggravated robbery or aggravated burglary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Common Pleas Court, Cuyahoga County (Ohio), where he was found guilty of murder, reduced from an indictment for aggravated murder. He was sentenced to 15 years to life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter. There was considerable testimony that defendant purposely attacked his victim with a kitchen knife, stabbing him until he was dead. However, the court agreed with defendant that there was evidence tending to prove his affirmative defense of self-defense and tending to establish the mitigating circumstance of extreme emotional stress as described in the voluntary manslaughter statute. Because the jury could have reasonably concluded that the victim's actions were sufficiently provocative to put defendant under the influence of sudden passion, the court held that the trial court should have instructed the jury on voluntary manslaughter. The court rejected defendant's constitutional challenges to the statute under which he was convicted, &sect; 2903.02 and to the statute defining &quot;reasonable doubt,&quot; &sect; 2901.05. The court held that the jury was properly instructed on reasonable doubt and that any improper comments made by the prosecutor was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, without a jury, also found defendant guilty of being a pedestrian under the influence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police observed defendant dragging his female companion across street. When police approached defendant, the female ran off. While questioning defendant, police noticed that defendant was under the influence of alcohol. Police arrested defendant. Defendant resisted arrest, and police had to use force. There was a jury trial on the assault and resisting arrest charges, and to trial court without a jury on the pedestrian under the influence and disorderly conduct charges. Defendant was found guilty by a jury of resisting arrest and not guilty of assault. Trial court found defendant guilty of pedestrian under the influence and innocent of disorderly conduct. The court affirmed. There was no prejudice in prosecutor recalling a witness. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.10 it was within the discretion of trial court to allow testimony. Trial court's findings were not against weight of the evidence. Fact that there was no traffic on street was irrelevant. Defendant was under the influence and was a hazard to his life and the female he was escorting. There was sufficient evidence to find defendant guilty of resisting arrest. Police did not strike at the defendant until he struck at police.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was on parole when she was charged with receiving stolen property. A parole holder was filed against her charging her with a parole violation because she was charged with receiving stolen property.

The parole violation charge was dropped, defendant was released, and she pleaded guilty to receiving stolen property. She filed a motion to credit the time served on the parole violation under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.191. The trial court overruled the motion, and on appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant did not establish an Equal Protection claim because she failed to demonstrate that she was treated differently under the law than others in her same circumstances. Defendant was not entitled to credit time because her confinement under the parole holder did not arise out of the receiving stolen property offense.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also found that the ordinance was in conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4735.18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city passed the ordinance to give its citizens greater consumer protection than that provided by state law. The ordinance incorporated state regulations regarding the sale of goods and services. It also gave the city enforcement authority and it included new penalties for violations. The realtors objected, stating that the ordinance was vague as to services provided by realtors. The trial court agreed. The court reversed on appeal, holding the ordinance constitutional. The court found that the ordinance did not conflict with the state laws regarding consumer protection. The realtors had not pointed out why the rules applicable to consumer transactions that were services were uncertain or vague if applied to realtors. The Substantive Rules of the Ohio Consumer Protection Agency were properly incorporated into the ordinance. In addition, the ordinance did not conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4735.18 regarding the licensing of realtors. Finally, a provision allowing the city to investigate complaints outside of its city limits was permissible because no enforcement authority was being attempted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The residents filed a petition to incorporate. The day before the public election on the question was to be held, the challengers obtained injunctive relief to stop the election. The residents then withdrew their petition.

The residents filed a second petition for a second election. The challengers amended their complaint to include a challenge to the second petition. The trial court did not consider the second petition to be before it. The court affirmed, finding the dismissal of the action to be proper. The second petition would have to be challenged in a second action. The first action had become moot. As such, the trial court could use its discretion under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.02 in deciding whether to approach the constitutional question and grant declaratory relief. To refuse to do so was proper under the circumstances, considering the fact that a second action had, in fact, been filed and that a second election had been held, achieving incorporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After sustaining damages in an accident, the injury victim filed the negligence action in the court of claims. The court of claims dismissed the matter and the injury victim appealed from the judgment. The court affirmed dismissal of the actions against the power company, the telephone company, the Board of County Commissioners and the Board of Township Trustees. Giving full weight to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.02(E), the court of claims properly concluded that joinder was precluded in an action originally filed in the court of claims of any defendant who was severally liable with the Department with respect to the same claim. The apparent intent of &sect; 2743.02(E) was to require a separate action to be filed against any person severally liable with the Department, even though the requirement was inconsistent with the general philosophy of modern practice and the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure. The court of claims did not commit prejudicial error in dismissing the non-State parties. The court reversed the portion of the judgment dismissing the Department. Dismissal for failure to strictly comply with Ohio. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.16(D) constituted an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insured and the passenger were involved in a car accident in which the passenger sustained personal injuries. The passenger filed an action for damages against the insured, which the insurance company defended. The insurance company then filed an action against the insured seeking declaratory judgment that the policy did not cover the passenger's damages, and the passenger intervened as a defendant. The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellees, and the insurance company sought review. The court held that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the insured had breached a cooperation clause in the policy, despite the fact that the insured allegedly had gone to the office of the passenger's attorney and stated that he had accepted money from the passenger in exchange for a ride. The court reasoned that because the Ohio Guest Statute had been held unconstitutional at the time of trial, the statement was not prejudicial to the insurance company. The court then held that even if the insured did accept such a payment, it did not increase the insurance company's risk to the extent that it fell under a policy exclusion for carrying persons for fare.</SPAN></P>

Defendant used a hybrid representation at trial, which defendant claimed violated his constitutional right to assistance of counsel. While defendant had a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel and a constitutional right to represent himself, he did not have the right to the type of hybrid representation that he requested. However, the trial court did not err by allowing defendant to proceed in this manner. Defendant continuously voiced his desire to represent himself and retain counsel for advisory assistance.

The court modified the trial court's judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife alleged that she and the husband had a common-law marriage but that at the time, the husband was legally married to another. The trial court held that no valid marriage ever existed between the parties and granted the wife an absolute annulment. The trial court rendered judgment without the husband present because he was incarcerated. The husband argued that he was denied access to the court. The court found that the husband's allegations were without merit, as the record was full of various documents filed by the husband. The trial court and the court clerk had no obligation to initiate process for the husband to be available at a hearing in a civil action. The husband retained his right to access to the court and could have filed affidavits, or a deposition, in addition to the documents he did file. There was no duty to provide counsel for an indigent in a civil action. There was no reason to believe that the trial court's findings were not supported by the facts. Whatever testimony the husband might have been able to provide at a hearing, if he had been present, could not have changed the effect of his own divorce action upon the wife 's annulment action against him.</SPAN></P>

The decedent's two minor children successfully filed a motion to intervene in the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent died as a result of an injury sustained in the course of and arising out of his employment with the electric company. An application for death benefits was thereafter filed under the Ohio Workers' Compensation law. An administrator granted the death benefits application. Two years after the decedent's death, his widow remarried, and the electric company paid her two years compensation in a lump sum, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.59, terminating her interest in the claim. The electric company continued to make payments to each minor child for the next two years. The widow then filed a motion for reapportionment of the weekly payment previously made to her, requesting that it be paid to her two children. A district hearing officer granted the motion. The Commission refused the electric company's appeal. Although there was no specific provision for reapportionment in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.59, the mandatory nature of the provisions relating to calculation of award and determination of dependency at the time of death led to the conclusion that the gross amount was to be reapportioned among the remaining dependents when there was an elimination of a dependent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners operated a business out of their residence. The mayor received complaints from village residents concerning the owners' operations. The mayor met with the owners and informed them that the operation of the business was in violation of a zoning ordinance. The owners stated that they would not comply with the ordinance until its constitutionality had been determined. Four warrants on complaint were filed against the owners. The owners filed a declaratory judgment action to determine the constitutionality of the ordinance. The trial court awarded judgment to the village. On appeal, the court found that the language of the zoning ordinance was not so vague that men of common intelligence had to guess as to its meaning. The court further found that the owners' business was far more substantial than what was permitted by the zoning ordinance as an accessory use. Such an enterprise was not a minor business, incidental to the residence, but was an extensive, full-time operation. As such, the business greatly impaired the residential character of the district. Accordingly, the court held that the zoning ordinance was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or invalid beyond fair debate.</SPAN></P>

Defendant committed two criminal acts. First, he was unlawfully carrying a firearm and second, he used that firearm to cause the death of another person. There was no provision in the law of Ohio that prevented consecutive sentences where two or more offenses had been committed. On the contrary, Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers claimed to represent citizens of the State who were beneficiaries of all wild animals in the state. Their amended complaint alleged that the promulgation of &sect; 1501:31-3-02 by the Ohio Division of Wildlife represented an unlawful delegation of legislative authority and that enforcement of the section constituted an unconstitutional denial of due process and equal protection by permitting sport fishing while banning commercial fishing of walleye in Lake Erie. The trial court denied injunctive relief and the taxpayers appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. The taxpayers did not contest the fact that the management of wildlife was a proper subject of legislative delegation. The Division of Wildlife had as its aim the improvement of the walleye fishery in Lake Erie, and the banning of commercial fishing had a rational relation to the objective sought. There was no suspect distinction in the distinction between commercial and sport fishermen and thus no equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer subdivided land into five residential lots, and he began construction on one lot. When the house was nearly completed, the town passed a zoning ordinance requiring residential lots to have a minimum frontage. The developer's lot did not comply, but he sold the house and lot to the buyer. The officer and prosecutor filed suit against the developer and the buyer, who filed a cross-complaint against the developer. The trial court entered summary judgment for the officer and prosecutor, ordered the developer to convey additional land to the buyer, and denied the buyer damages. The developer appealed, and the court reversed and remanded. After remand, the developer appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The literal application of the minimum lot requirements was an undue burden on the already developed lot. Therefore, the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the lot. The trial court had no authority to order the conveyance of land. The correct remedy was by injunction. Thus, the developer was enjoined from further violations, and the buyer was enjoined from using the premises until it conformed to the ordinance as constitutionally applied.</SPAN></P>

It entered final judgment enjoining the developer and the buyer from using the lots until they complied with the ordinance as constitutionally applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for rape in the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County (Ohio). Defendant argued that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence, that the indictment was improper, that the denial of motions for a directed verdict of acquittal and for limiting instructions on similar acts was improper, that the defense was improperly denied an in-camera hearing, and that the trial court made prejudicial comments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police observed defendant stop his car and pick up a 12-year-old boy who was a known prostitute. The boy admitted that defendant picked him up a few days earlier and engaged in oral sex with him in exchange for money. However, the boy claimed that he did not have sexual relations with defendant during the present encounter. Defendant was convicted of rape, and he appealed. The court reversed, holding that defendant was denied his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation when he was not allowed to impeach the boy's credibility through cross-examination. Thus, the court ordered a new trial. Because the weight of the evidence demonstrated that the offense was committed prior to defendant's prosecution, the indictment was proper. The boy was not considered an accomplice, and the conviction could be had on his uncorroborated testimony. The trial court's refusal to give the jury a limiting instruction as to similar acts was correct because defendant was also charged with attempted rape. Defendant was not prejudiced by the refusal to permit a voir dire of the boy prior to trial, and, although the trial court's comments were unnecessary, they were not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the decision from the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which convicted defendant of aggravated robbery. Defendant alleged that a suggestive lineup was prejudicial, that hearsay evidence was improperly admitted, that acquittal should have been granted because the State did not establish that a gun had been fired or was operable, and that the reasonable doubt statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant robbed two victims in a gasoline station. They provided descriptions, defendant was later stopped, and a similar weapon to the described weapon was found in his vehicle. Defendant contended that the lineup where one victim viewed him was suggestive because he was the only man with a cast on his arm. On appeal, the court disagreed. The lineup was not suggestive because both victims clearly identified defendant, he provided no disguise, and most importantly one victim identified him in the lineup before he turned to show the cast. One victim's testimony about what the other victim said about the gun was hearsay, but the error was harmless given the evidence of guilt. Testimony from the victim about when the two victims identified defendant was inadvertent hearsay and was cured by instructions to the jury. The State was not required to find that the weapon was operable under the aggravated robbery statute. The definition of reasonable doubt in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05 was constitutional and did not diminish the State's burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions for two counts of aggravated robbery were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant property owner sought review of a judgment from the Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which, without a hearing or opinion, found that a zoning ordinance zoning his property as limited industrial reasonable, constitutional, and valid and that appellee village's refusal to rezone the property was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the issue was whether the zoning classification for limited industrial use as applied to the property owner's property was unconstitutional. The property owner also argued that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his request for separate findings of fact and conclusions of law. Upon review, the court held that the trial court erred in finding in favor of the village. The stipulations of evidence and exhibits displayed facts relevant to the issue of the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance. The village relied on the same record to offset the rebuttal of the constitutional presumption that the property owner claimed the stipulated evidence supported. Because the evidence favorable to the property owner was sufficient to put the invalidity of the zoning ordinance in issue beyond fair debate, the burden of going forward shifted to the village. However, the village was content to rely on the stipulated facts to support the health, safety, and general welfare objectives of the ordinance. It introduced no additional evidence. Because of the state of the trial court's conclusions, the request for findings of fact and conclusions of law needed full compliance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defense counsel orally moved to withdraw defendant's guilty plea prior to sentencing, but after defendant learned what the sentence was going to be. The Erie County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) overruled defendant's motion to withdraw his plea of guilty and sentenced defendant to an indeterminate prison term of one to five years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the plea proceedings, defense counsel stated that he had explained to defendant the rights he was waiving by entering the plea and believed defendant understood those rights, that there was no guarantee of probation, and the possible penalties. Thereafter the court addressed the defendant as to the effect of entering a guilty plea. Defendant indicated he understood. Defendant admitted having sex with the victim, that he induced her to use drugs to make it easier for him to have sexual contact, that he knew what he was doing at the time, and that he was satisfied with his defense counsel. Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in accepting his plea of guilty without first determining that he made the plea with a full understanding of the nature of the charge against him and without informing him that the trial court, upon acceptance of the plea, could proceed with judgment and sentence, as required by Ohio R. Civ. P. 11(C)(2) and the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Considering all the circumstances, the court found that the trial court did not strictly comply with Ohio R. Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Before the State filed a response to his petition, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment and the State thereafter filed its own motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the State's motion and dismissed the petition. The court, in affirming the trial court's judgment, first found that the trial court's acceptance of the State's motion, more than four months after the filing of the petition, was within the trial court's discretion under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21(D). Next, the court, noting that the State's proof included affidavits by defense counsel stating that they kept no probative matters from defendant, found that allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel were unsupported by any evidence. Therefore, the court concluded that defendant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his petition. Finally, the court found that defendant's claim, that he should have been allowed to represent himself, was never asserted at the original trial or raised on direct appeal and was therefore barred by res judicata. The court overruled 26 additional assignments of error, finding them barred by res judicata, duplicative, or not argued in defendant's brief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant company sought review of a judgment from the Common Pleas Court, Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which affirmed a decision from appellee Bedford Heights Board of Zoning Appeals affirming the denial of the company's request for a zoning variance from the City of Bedford Heights, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company sought a building permit and a zoning variance from the City, which requests were denied and the denials affirmed by the Board. The company appealed, and the trial court affirmed. The company sought further review, and the court reversed, holding that while some evidence was presented to the Board on the issue of the constitutionality of the City's zoning ordinances prohibiting conversion to a &quot;mini-mart&quot; and service station combination, the evidence was insufficient for the trial court to make a constitutional determination. The court determined that because the record before the trial court was insufficient, additional evidence should have been received, as the issue of constitutionality could not have been determined administratively by the Board. The court found that a letter from the Board, which informed the company that the Board considered itself without the authority to grant a variance under the circumstances, satisfied the requirements of Bedford Heights, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 1133.05(d) because the degree of the use's nonconformity would have been altered and structural alterations made if the company converted the service station as it has proposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted along with her husband and a friend of murdering her mother-in-law and her grandmother-in-law.

The court held that: (1) notes, jottings, recorded impressions, observations reduced to writing and the like, of a witness for his own use during investigation did not have that degree of finality, adoption or approval required for Ohio R. Crim.

His petition argued that the trial court had erred in placing the burden of proving self-defense upon the defense.

Because appellant failed to timely raise such issues, the doctrine of res judicata precluded him from raising them in a petition for post-conviction relief. The court held that constitutional issues could not be considered in post-conviction proceedings where they had already been or could have been fully litigated by the prisoner while represented by counsel, either before his judgment of conviction or on direct appeal from that judgment.</SPAN></P>

When the police arrived, defendant was actively raping the victim. Defendant was charged with, among other things, rape, gross sexual imposition, and kidnapping. At trial, the State presented the testimony of a woman who had been raped under nearly identical conditions by defendant and his friend on a prior occasion. On appeal, defendant contended, among other things, that the common pleas court improperly admitted the testimony of the prior rape victim. The court held that the testimony was properly admitted pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city employee drove an emergency vehicle to the home of a person exhibiting the symptoms of a severe cardiovascular problem. While taking the person to the hospital, the driver struck the emergency vehicle as it swung left of center to go through an opening in the congested traffic. Summary judgment was granted for appellees on the driver's claim. Affirming, the court held that the adoption of civil immunity from liability by the city, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 701.02, was not unconstitutional. The city and its firemen had a full defense in an action based on the negligence of the firemen in answering any emergency alarm. To hold that the defense did not apply to the acts of a specially-trained fire squadsman, the city employee, in transporting an apparent heart-attack victim to a hospital upon the call of a member of the victim's family would have required the court to violate the plain meaning of the statute. When the city employee answered the call for assistance, he and the city became cloaked with immunity from civil liability for any negligent acts by the city employee during the course of his activities in providing the requested assistance.</SPAN></P>

Crim. P. 24(C). The comment made by the prosecuting attorney that the decedent was deliberately shot while on the floor moaning was not prejudicial error because everything in the statement, except for the moaning, could be inferred from the evidence. The State's exhibits were properly admitted because the chain of custody was established where there was a reasonable probability the articles had not been changed in important respects. There was no abuse of discretion in the admission of gruesome photographs of the victim into evidence. Testimony by defendant's wife about his conduct after the killing was relevant, and she was competent to testify against her husband.</SPAN></P>

The mother argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.04&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived her of the Fourteenth Amendment rights of equal protection and due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A mother divorced her husband. The divorce decree granted custody of the parties' son to a nonparental custodian. When the child was six years old, the mother filed a motion for a change of custody to herself in the child's best interest. The mother argued that &sect; 3109.04 was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motion to modify child custody. The court reversed because the mother's right to raise her son was deemed essential, one of the basic civil rights of man, and far more precious than property rights. The rights of the child were best served and those of the parent preserved, insofar as they did not conflict with those of the child, when the court limited the scope of the inquiry on a motion to modify custody, where the contest was between a parent and a nonparental custodian, to the sole issue of the child's best interest. The test by which custody was modified between a parent and a nonparental custodian was the same as promulgated under &sect; 3109.04(A), the best interest of the child. The court remanded the case for a hearing that included consideration of the material change of circumstances of the custodian or the child that bore upon the child's best interest.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the father's motion to dismiss based on parental immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The children were passengers in the car driven by their father when the accident occurred. It was stipulated that the children had resided in a home with the father. Plaintiffs claimed that the trial court erred in denying a remedy by due course under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. 1, &sect; 16. They claimed that the doctrine of parental immunity was unconstitutional in denying equal protection or uniform operation of the laws. On review, the court disagreed. It found that the doctrine furthered a valid governmental interest. The court held that the issue of the constitutionality of the doctrine of parental immunity was properly before it and that the doctrine did not violate either the federal or Ohio law. Under the doctrine, a parent was immune from suit by his unemancipated minor child for a tort unless the facts of the case were sufficient to show an abandonment of the parental relationship, which was not shown in the instant case.</SPAN></P>

The court explained that such grant conferred power to regulate the civil service of the city by rules within the scope of valid policy guidelines established by the city council under its legislative power, and it did not divest the council of power to legislate in all areas concerning the commission.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with possession of heroin for sale and sale of heroin. He was convicted and sentenced on both counts. The counts arose from the same transaction and were predicated upon identical evidence. The quantity of heroin which formed the basis for the possession for sale conviction and sentence was the precise substance involved in the sale transaction. Defendant asserted it was permissible to convict and sentence him on only one of the charges but not both. The court found that where the identical quantity was involved in both counts, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25(A) was violated if defendant was convicted and sentenced on both. The sale here necessarily involved possessing that quantity for sale to begin with such that but one offense had been committed.Accordingly, defendant's conviction and sentence for possession for sale of heroin was vacated. The conviction for sale of heroin remained intact and was affirmed. Defendant contended that he was prejudiced by the joinder of indictments for trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Mayor's Court of the Village of Lisbon (Ohio), which convicted him of squealing hi tires in violation of Lisbon Village, Ohio, Ordinance 432.35. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to declare the ordinance unconstitutional and erred in finding him guilty because the conviction was against the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer on routine patrol heard the sound of squealing tires and observed defendant's van. The officer followed the van and when defendant parked it and alighted therefrom, the officer inquired whether the van was his. The officer then gave defendant a ticket and arrested him. Defendant was convicted and appealed, arguing that it was error to refuse to declare the ordinance unconstitutional. The court noted that defendant had failed to preserve the claimed error for appeal. The court noted nonetheless that the ordinance's constitutionality had been upheld in another challenge made on similar facts. The court found that the language of the ordinance was sufficiently explicit to inform those subject to it of what conduct would render them liable for penalties. Defendant also argued that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence because there was no evidence that he had left tire marks on the roadway in addition to squealing his tires. The court stated that defendant misinterpreted the ordinance, noting that the provision used the conjunctive &quot;or&quot; between the phrases relating to squealing the tires and leaving tire marks.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The instructors sought a declaratory judgment that certain provisions of the labor agreement between the university and the union were unlawful. Following the trial court's rulings, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the university board of trustees could have recognized and contracted with the union as an exclusive bargaining unit of the instructors, who had a community of interest, and that the board could have entered into an agency shop agreement with the union. Further, while the board could have required compliance with an agency shop agreement as a condition of employment, that provision did not apply to teachers who had attained &quot;tenure&quot; pursuant to the agreement. Membership dues to the union could have be checked off upon written request of the instructor, but was revocable by the instructor. However, agency fees could not have been checked off for an instructor, even upon agreement, because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 9.41 allowed only dues check-off. The court enjoined the university from the withholding of service fees, and during the life of the agreement from imposing agency shop provisions as a condition of employment of tenured teachers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with criminal trespass for being in the parking lot of a hotel which had experienced prostitution on its premises. On the morning of defendant's trial, the State moved to amend the complaint to state a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.21(A)(3) instead of &sect; 2911.21(A)(2). Upon review, defendant claimed the trial court erred in permitting the State to amend its complaint and alleged a violation of equal protection because the hotel owner had not caused any men to be prosecuted for trespassing. The court held that the provisions of two sections were so akin in language that substantially the same evidence and witnesses would have proved a violation of either charge. Defense counsel did not ask for a continuance, and the record revealed that the amendment to the complaint did not hamper defendant in his defense. The court held that the amendment was permissible under Ohio R. Crim. P. 7(D). The court held that the argument that a statute was unconstitutional due to selective enforcement was inapplicable when criminal proceedings were initiated by a private citizen who was not a public official.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the village had the right to regulate traffic within its jurisdiction under its police power and sound amplification in streets and public places was subject to reasonable regulation. The court held that men of ordinary intelligence knew what it meant to &quot;peel tires&quot; so as to cause a screeching sound.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a collision between plaintiff's car and defendants' truck at an intersection, plaintiff brought a negligence action against defendants. After plaintiff was denied a directed verdict, the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants after finding plaintiff contributorily negligence. Plaintiff sought review, claiming that trial court had erred in denying a directed verdict, that the finding of contributory negligence was improper, and that the doctrine of contributory negligence was unconstitutional. Upon review, the court held that when the evidence was construed in favor of defendants, as was required with respect to a motion for a directed verdict, reasonable minds could have reached different conclusions as to defendants' negligence and plaintiff's negligence. Moreover, in upholding the finding of contributory negligence, the court held it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that plaintiff had entered the intersection heedless of what might be approaching.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of pandering obscenity in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.32(A)(2). On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment against defendant. The court concluded that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress because a police officer's purchase of the magazine at issue was not an unlawful search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Defendant had no expectation of privacy because the commercial premises were open to the public and the police officer entered the store and bought the magazine as any member of the general public might have done. The court found that the trial court's instruction to the jury with respect to the definition of obscenity was not unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. The court also found that the complaint alleged that defendant knew the character of the magazine, that the jury was instructed in that regard, and that the State proved that defendant knew the contents of the magazine. The court determined that defendant's right to equal protection under the law was not violated because he was not a projectionist.

While at the police station, defendant threatened the officers. He was found guilty of resisting arrest and aggravated menacing. The court found that a police officer could only make a warrantless arrest for misdemeanors that occurred in his presence and, as defendant's behavior at the rental agency did not occur in their presence the police were not authorized to make the warrantless arrest. As defendant's arrest was not lawful, his conviction for resisting arrest had to be reversed. The court then found that while defendant could exercise his privilege to resist an unlawful arrest, he not could go beyond the scope of that privilege and threaten illegal acts in retaliation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted and tried for attempted murder. The Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) submitted to the jury the lesser-included offenses of felonious assault and aggravated assault, and defendant pled self-defense. Defendant was convicted and subsequently appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was shot by defendant following a bar room argument. Defendant argued that the shooting was done in self-defense, and that there was a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. Affirming, the court held that the trial judge properly submitted the issue of self-defense to the jury. Even if the jury found that defendant was provoked, such provocation did not necessarily arise out of fear of imminent death or great bodily harm at the hands of the victim. The evidence supported all of the essential elements of the crime of which defendant was convicted. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2951.02(F), precluding probation for defendant because he was &quot;armed with a firearm&quot; when he committed the crime, was not unconstitutional. A punishment did not violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and inhuman punishments if it was not so disproportionate to the offense as to shock the sense of justice of the community.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinance had been adopted while the police officers were in probationary status. The union and police officers contended on appeal that the trial court erred in finding that Bedford Heights, Ohio, Codified Ordinances &sect; 157.20 did not conflict with the city's charter and in finding that the Ordinance did not constitute retroactive legislation. The court affirmed the judgment. The court determined that the city council's authority to enact a residency ordinance under its legislative power was not precluded by the charter, and it pointed out that passage of the Ordinance was not even inconsistent with the civil service commission's own employment rule. The court found that application of the Ordinance to the police officers while serving as probationary employees and as a condition of permanent employment was prospective and not retrospective, and it stated that since the Ordinance was applied to the police officers prospectively, their constitutional rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A bartender at a bar died from a gunshot wound following a robbery. The State's case depended primarily upon the testimony of witnesses with prior criminal records, including defendant's alleged accomplice. One witness testified that defendant told him that he had just shot a man while robbing the bar. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury that it could consider the previous criminal convictions of a witness in judging the credibility of his testimony denied defendant a fair trial and due process of law. The court reasoned that the basic issue was whether the requested instructions were included in substance in the trial court's general charge upon credibility; and, if not, whether defendant was materially prejudiced. The court held that the general charge did not include the substance of the requested instructions with the required succinctness necessary for a complete charge on the law. Further, the court held that it could not say that the error in failing to include the substance of the requested instructions was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the State's case depended primarily upon the witnesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner paid almost no property tax pending resolution of his dispute. The trial court adopted a referee's recommendations which found that the Board made an error in its initial evaluation and ordered that the owner be relieved of any amount due to the error, together with any penalty thereon. However, the owner only contested his obligation to pay a penalty on the unpaid taxes that he still owed. He argued that the legislature did not intend to penalize people who withheld tax payments and later successfully proved an erroneous valuation. He also argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5719.17, 5715.19 violated &sect; 19 of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of Ohio and U.S. Const. V, and constituted a deprivation of property without due process. The court found that the statutes set forth the procedures to be followed to contest the amount of valuation assessed against the owner and he was given the opportunity to minimize any penalty he might have incurred by tendering the amount he thought was proper, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.19. The court held that the trial court properly applied the statutes and that the constitutional due process requirements were satisfied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with and convicted of aggravated robbery, two counts of kidnapping, and two counts of aggravated murder and was sentenced to death. On appeal, defendant argued that his statement to the police should have been suppressed. The court found that defendant had been properly advised of his Miranda rights and he had admitted that his statement to the police was voluntary. The court then rejected defendant's claim that the search warrant issued was invalid because the premises did not belong to defendant. Defendant then argued that the jury instructions, particularly as to the definition of aider and abettor were prejudicial. The court rejected this argument because defendant did not object to this instruction and, thus, he had waived any right to challenge it on appeal. The court also found that the remainder of the instructions were clear and definite and that no evidence existed that the jurors had been coerced or subjected to undue influence. Defendant's failure to file a motion for a new trial pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 33 precluded him from getting a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. Finally, the court set aside defendant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that convicted defendant, but modified defendant's sentence to imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ohio Rev.

On appeal, defendant contended that he was in the process of transferring his legal residence from Ohio to Kentucky and had reached the point where Kentucky police required him to obtain a Kentucky driver's license and that, consequently, retention of his Ohio operator's permit would have been illegal. The court rejected this contention, holding that the evidence bearing upon the situs of defendant's legal residence was sufficient to justify the conclusion by a reasonable mind that defendant was a resident of the State of Ohio and, therefore, amenable to the provisions of &sect; 4507.02. Defendant's conviction for displaying a Kentucky plate was reversed because the only evidence of ownership of the vehicle then being operated by defendant was the arresting officer's belief that defendant owned it.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was no testimony that defendant ever received any money, either from massage parlor operations or from its sub-rosa brothel operations and that the trial court added a fact to the record, i.e., that body massage business would increase because of sexual activity upon the premises, without any request that this fact be judicially noticed.

Code Ann 2907.02(D) declared unconstitutional on the ground that it denied him the opportunity to produce specific instances of the alleged victim's sexual activity other than with defendant. He indicated he wanted to question the victim about any abortions she had. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that evidence of the victim's alleged past abortions was not barred by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(D), in that abortions were not sexual activity and did not involve evidence of the origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease. The court therefore declined to rule on the constitutionality of the statute. But the court found that evidence of abortion was not relevant to any issue raised at trial, and was therefore inadmissible on the grounds of relevancy. The court also held that Ohio R. Crim. P. 6(A) superseded Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2939.20 as to procedural matters, and that an indictment properly rendered by a grand jury composed of fewer than 15 members did not deprive defendant of any substantive right.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held, among other things, that: (1) the officer's purchase did not violate defendant's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights because the magazine was purchased in the ordinary course of business in a store open to the public; (2) photographs of the premises were properly admitted into evidence because they were relevant and an accurate representation of the interior of the store as it appeared on the date the magazine was purchases; (3) a search warrant was not required to take the photographs because the portions of the store that were photographed were in open and plain view of the public; (4) the State sufficiently showed that defendant had knowledge of the character of the magazine; and (5) the definition of obscenity in Ohio Rev.

The state asked another codefendant a question eliciting a response that he had been convicted after trial. Defendant objected, but the codefendant had already answered. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to death. On appeal, defendant claimed that the response to state's questioning of the codefendant constituted prejudicial error. The court agreed that the prior conviction of the jointly indicted but separately tried codefendant, was not admissible as probative of the guilt of defendant. The court stated that defendant's objection should have been sustained or a limiting instruction should have been given, but affirmed the conviction, concluding that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt based on the cumulative weight of the body of evidence against defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants challenged their convictions for engaging in organized crime and publishing obscene material for commercial exploitation. The court held that it was clearly error for a trial judge to communicate with the jury out of the presence of defendants. There was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal to allow defense counsel to voir dire specifically on the subject of the war mailer. A letter was highly inflammatory and prejudicial to defendants, and there was no evidentiary basis for its admission, particularly in light of its prejudicial effect. The contents of the entire letter were outside the scope of proper rebuttal and they served no purpose insofar as any rehabilitation of the witness was concerned. The lower court did err, to defendants' prejudice, when it instructed the jury on the definition of obscenity, for the reason that the court failed to instruct the jury, under the Ohio statute, as to the specific definitions of the sexual conduct proscribed by state law. The jury not having received such instructions could not fairly arrive at a determination of whether defendants' materials were obscene within the meaning of state law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed. In reversing and remanding the trial court's judgment, the court held that the trial court erred. The court determined that the trial judge improperly found that defendant waived his right to counsel after his request, by agreeing to continued questioning. The court found that defendant's confession of guilt that followed a custodial interrogation where he was not provided assistance of counsel after he invoked his right to counsel should have been suppressed by the trial court. The court stated that map and other inculpatory material that followed the confession were also tainted fruit of the confession and should have been suppressed. The court determined that defendant did not initiate any conversation after he requested counsel and that all conversations were initiated by law enforcement.

His motion to dismiss the specification was granted by the trial court because the United States Supreme Court had declared the Ohio scheme for imposing the death penalty unconstitutional. The trial court held that because no new scheme had replaced the unconstitutional scheme, the specification was dismissed because defendant was entitled to know at the commencement of the trial what penalty could be imposed on him. The state appealed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.67, claiming error in dismissing the specification because a new death penalty statute could have been enacted before defendant's sentencing. The court affirmed, holding that fairness and common sense dictated that defendant should be tried and sentenced under the state of the law as it existed at the commencement of his trial. The court held that defendant was required to be tried under a law that imposed a sentence of life imprisonment for aggravated murder regardless of the aggravating circumstances, without any possibility of imposing a sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city enacted Ordinance 104-77, which banned bicycle riding on the pavement or berm of portions of three streets. It did, however, permit bicycle riding on the sidewalks adjoining these roads. Plaintiffs brought an action against the city in the trial court alleging that the Ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the ordinance, and the court agreed. The court found no conflict between the ordinance and any provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511. The court also held that the ordinance was not invalid as to the resident because, although the ordinance prevented him from taking the most convenient route to work, he only bicycled to work 30 percent of the time and, therefore, the inconvenience did not make the ordinance unreasonable. The court also disagreed that the ordinance was constitutionally infirm because it did not discriminate between adult and minor bicyclists. Because ordinances were presumed constitutional, due respect for the legislative function required a clear showing of invalidity, which was not shown.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lessor leased space to charitable organizations for the purpose of bingo. After the enactment of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915, the lessor was limited as to the number of charitable organizations leasing the premises each week and the amount of rent charged. The lessor filed an action seeking to enjoin the enforcement of amended Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.09(A)(3) and asking the court to declare the provision unconstitutional as a taking of private property without compensation. The trial court ruled that the statute was not unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the lessor did have a property right. The court found that &sect; 2915 met the tests of constitutionality and was a valid exercise of the state's police power. The court further found that &sect; 2915.09(A)(3) was not an unreasonable means of attaining a legitimate purpose and was in a substantial relationship with such purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city sought review of an order by the Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) holding that Akron, Oh., Traffic Code &sect; 406.03 was unconstitutional. While appellee landowner and other similarly situated persons had sought to invalidate a resolution prohibiting the use of a street for certain purposes, which resolution was issued by the city engineer pursuant to his power under &sect; 406.03, the common pleas court struck the entire law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the city engineer prohibited the use of a certain road for specific purposes, the landowner sued the city and asked that the prohibition be voided and that &sect; 406.03 be construed and interpreted. He sought remedies in the form of injunctive relief as well as a declaration that the engineer's action was invalid and unconstitutional. The common pleas court thereupon ruled that the entire chapter of the Code constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power to an administrative officer and therefore was unconstitutional. The city appealed and the court reversed. It first found that the landowner had not sought a declaration that &sect; 406.03 was unconstitutional, only a declaration that the city engineer's prohibition issued thereunder was improper. By ruling on an issue not raised in the complaint, the common pleas court erred. Nor was the judgment supported by the quantum of proof necessary to sustain a finding that a public enactment was unconstitutional. Because &sect; 406.03 was entitled to a presumption of constitutionality, and because its unconstitutionality was not demonstrated as required, reversal of the resulting judgment was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order of the common pleas court invalidating the city's traffic code.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A proposed initiative petition with signatures was submitted to the attorney general. Because of discrepancies in the petition it was returned to the committee, who redrafted the language and resubmitted the petition. The attorney general accepted the petition, attached the signatures from the prior petition and submitted the entire document to defendant the secretary of state. Plaintiffs filed an action to enjoin the secretary from transmitting the petition to the general assembly. The trial court denied the injunction, and plaintiff appealed the decision. Plaintiffs first argued that the entire proceeding was a nullity because the second petition did not contain any signatures. The court held that while the secretary and attorney general failed to comply with the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3519.01 in certifying the petition, such noncompliance was insufficient as to have denied the petitioners the rights constitutionally conferred with regard to such documents. Plaintiffs final contentions raised constitutional issues. The court held that it was precluded from considering the constitutional validity of the proposed law. The judgment, therefore, was proper.</SPAN></P>

Defendants filed motions for acquittal that the trial court denied, and defendants were convicted of the crime charged. Defendants challenged the conviction contending that the trial court erred in overruling their motions for acquittal as the evidence adduced was insufficient as a matter of law to have established each essential element of the charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that for the reason there was no evidence of retail sale by the state to overcome their own evidence of regularity of the transactions, that the element of the crime, &quot;sale at retail,&quot; was not only insufficient as a matter of law, but totally lacking and that the motions for judgment of acquittal should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A father sought to modify a child custody order issued in his divorce. The lower court denied the motion and the father appealed. The court found that while the conduct of the mother was questionable and the home situation was not the best situation, the lower court had not abused its discretion. Because the father was living in a camper in back of a pickup, he was not a proper person to have custody. Further, the father's age of 70 years was relevant to his ability to be the custodian of young children who were under the age of 10. While age alone was not the only factor, it was definitely a matter to be considered, if one was mindful of the physical demands raising children entailed. But, the court held that where a person's age could affect his ability to care for children, courts could take that into consideration in deciding questions of custody. The fact that the lower court judge was seen leaving the home of the mother on the evening of the hearing, was not a sign of bias or prejudice which would necessitate a new hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A plain-clothes policeman purchased an obscene magazine from defendant's store. The officer did not have a warrant for the purchase. Defendant was convicted of pandering obscenity. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the obscenity statute found in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2907.01(F), 2907.32(A)(4), was constitutional. The court also found that it was not necessary for defendant to have knowledge of the contents of the magazine in order to sustain the conviction. The purchase of the magazine by the officer in plain clothes without a search warrant was neither a search nor a seizure under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The State was permitted to prove the knowledge of character of the material solely through circumstantial evidence. Thus, evidence of a prior act of defendant was properly admitted under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.59 to show that seller knew the character of the material sold. The trial judge properly instructed the jury on the elements of obscenity and that the material must be proven obscene beyond a reasonable doubt case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the trial court (Ohio), which sentenced defendant to a prison term of 30 days after defendant pled no contest to a charge of reckless driving in violation of Cincinnati, Ohio Mun. Code &sect; 506-6. Under the state statute against reckless driving, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.20, the punishment could not have exceeded a fine of $ 100.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Given the disparity in penalties between the reckless driving statutes, defendant argued that the sentence imposed by the trial court was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court disagreed and affirmed. Traffic laws were not general laws requiring uniform statewide operation under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3, and no conflict existed merely because different penalties were provided for the same acts, even though greater penalties were imposed by the local code. Likewise, there was no merit to defendant's claim that the disparity violated equal protection by infringing on his right to travel. There was no authority to support defendant's claim that the right to travel by car within a state was a fundamental right, the restriction of which was subject to rigid scrutiny. To the contrary, the home rule provisions of the Ohio Constitution granted municipalities all powers of local self-government in the regulation of vehicular traffic which prevailed over requirements of uniform statewide operation. Finally, the restriction on the class of drivers subject to the local code was substantially related to the public health, safety, and welfare. Thus, there was no equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a principal stockholder and officer in a corporation owning a theater, was charged by citation with pandering obscenity contrary to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.32(A), a misdemeanor, as the result of a showing of an &quot;adult&quot; film in the theater. In accordance with the jury's guilty verdict, the Hamilton County Municipal Court (Ohio) entered a judgment that convicted and sentenced defendant. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's theater regularly showed &quot;soft core&quot; pornography films. When a &quot;hard core&quot; pornography film slipped past the theater's internal review process, defendant was indicted, convicted, and sentenced for the misdemeanor offense of pandering obscenity. Defendant appealed. Despite concluding that the film in question was obscene, the court held that the trial court erred in failing to grant defendant's motion for acquittal predicated upon the State's failure to prove knowledge and intent beyond a reasonable doubt. The court refused to presume knowledge under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.35 because the presumption was not conclusive where the evidence conclusively revealed defendant's lack of actual knowledge or intent. In a society in which much of what was read and nearly all of what was seen in theaters was to a greater or lesser degree &quot;sexually oriented&quot; although not necessarily obscene, every purveyor of this material would have stood in jeopardy of being conclusively presumed to have knowledge that he was criminally pandering obscenity if something accidentally slipped by him which transgressed the mutual and shadowy line separating the obscene from the merely distasteful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police officers came to execute a valid search warrant for drugs. As they knocked at the front door, defendant was arrested as he fled from the rear. He was under indictment for a drug offense at the time. Defendant told officers that there was a gun in the trunk of his car, which was parked nearby. Police obtained a warrant, opened the trunk and found a gun. Defendant alleged that the search was invalid because he was not specifically advised that anything he said could be used against him, but he had waived this argument by not raising it in the trial court. He argued that the weapons under disability statute violated his equal protection rights. The court held that there was a rational basis for classifying persons under indictment for drug offenses along with convicted felons as under disability to possess weapons. The police could arrest defendant because their warrant authorized the arrest of any person found at the premises. A ministerial error in listing the date that the warrant was issued did not affect the validity of the warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant doctor sought review of a decision of the Court of Common Pleas, Summit County (Ohio) entering judgment in favor of plaintiffs, a patient and her husband, following a jury trial on plaintiffs' medical malpractice action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The doctor claimed that the trial court had no jurisdiction as the parties did not first arbitrate plaintiffs' malpractice claim as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2711.21. The court held that the right to arbitration proceedings, as authorized by &sect; 2711.21, was subject to waiver and that as all the parties waived arbitration, the cause between them was allowed to proceed to jury trial without subjecting the trial court to a charge of lack of subject matter jurisdiction. If there were any issues that were tried but not raised by the pleadings, they were tried by implied consent of the parties in view of the doctor's failure to object. The doctor failed to demonstrate reversible error with respect to instances of misconduct by plaintiffs' counsel. The trial court's charge contained all the material elements of the requested instruction, and the expert medical evidence was sufficient to support an award of prospective damages. Because no award to either plaintiff exceeded $ 200,000, the doctor was not prejudiced by any error on the part of the trial court in ruling as it did on the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.43. The evidence sustained the verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a doctor and a clinic, sought review of a judgment from the Common Pleas Court, Summit County, (Ohio) which, following a jury trial, found for plaintiffs, an injured party and her husband, in a negligence action. The trial court ruled that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.43, limiting the amount of damages that could be recovered for a medical claim, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured party underwent surgery as a result of complaints indicative of bowel obstruction. The injured party's doctor had previously recommended a hysterectomy to the injured party because of chronic pelvic disease. During the surgery, it was ascertained that the anticipated bowel obstruction did not exist and the surgeon, after consultation with the injured party's doctor, performed the hysterectomy. The injured party developed complications, resulting in a disability. The doctor and the clinic contended that the trial court erred in instructing the jury and in ruling that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.43, which limited damages for a medical claim, was unconstitutional. The doctor and the clinic also argued that the trial court erred in allowing defendant's expert to testify without proof of his qualifications. The court held that the trial court's instructions properly used the evidence and that the trial court's finding that &sect; 2307.43 was unconstitutional was not prejudicial where the damages awarded were not in excess of the limitation. The court also concluded that, as a physician, defendant's witness was qualified as an expert witness under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11.</SPAN></P>

Defendant further claimed that the judgment and verdict of the trial court was not sustained by sufficient evidence and was contrary to law. Defendant argued that the trial court should have found him not guilty of aggravated robbery and, if the evidence warranted, guilty of a lesser included homicide offense. Defendant was charged with the shotgun killing of a bartender. Defendant went to the bar at closing time and robbed the bartender and then shot him in the face with a sawed off shotgun causing his immediate death. Affirming, the court held that defendant could be presumed to have intended cause the death of the bartender as a result of his voluntary act of aiming a loaded sawed-off shotgun at the victim's head.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that his conviction for possession for sale of a narcotic drug under Ohio Rev.

The court determined that the evidence supported the finding that defendant possessed narcotics that he threw out of the window at the moment it was apparent that police intended to stop the car in which defendant was riding, but that the record did not establish any evidence of possession for sale or attempted sale by defendant. The court noted that no inference of intent to sell could be drawn from mere possession. The court therefore modified the trial court's judgment to reflect that defendant was guilty of possession of a narcotic drug under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.09. The court reversed defendant's conviction for conspiracy to violate &sect; 3719.09 because one convicted of an offense could not also be convicted of conspiring to commit that offense under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A witness told the police that defendant, his brother, had marijuana in his room at the house that the two jointly owned. The officers questioned the witness. The group went to a magistrate, who issued a warrant. The Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) convicted defendant of trafficking in marijuana, by possession of more than the bulk amount, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(4), and denied his post-trial motions. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Only defendant's bedroom was searched. The trial court denied a pretrial motion to suppress and a motion for acquittal. The trial court convicted defendant. The court affirmed. The affidavit, though based on hearsay, stated a basis for the affiant's believing the source of the hearsay to be credible and a factual basis for the information furnished, sufficient to satisfy the Fourth Amendment test as codified in Ohio R. Crim. P. 41(C). Defendant was charged with, and convicted of, violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(4), a fourth degree felony, which required possession of at least the bulk amount of marijuana, which was 200 grams. There was no direct evidence as to weight at trial, other than visual inspection of the contraband. The finding that defendant possessed more than the bulk amount of marijuana was error. The trier of fact could not have determined from the evidence that the contraband weighed more than 200 grams. But it reasonably could have determined, by visual inspection of the contraband, that defendant was in possession of enough marijuana sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11(C)(3) (100 grams).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the trial court (Ohio), which granted appellee's motion under Ohio R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court noted if appellant's claim was based on fees for selling real estate, offering or attempting or agreeing to negotiate the sale of real estate, or assisting or directing the negotiation or closing of any real estate transaction, then appellant was required to plead and prove that he was licensed as a real estate broker in order to maintain an action under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4735.21. Viewing all of the allegations of appellant's amended complaint, it was clear that appellant's claim was based on fees for the enumerated activities, and because appellant's brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss admitted that appellant was not a licensed real estate broker, he could prove no set of facts that would have established that he was entitled to relief under &sect; 4735.21. The trial court correctly granted appellee's motion to dismiss. Because appellant's activities were clearly linked to the sale of the particular property rather than merely listing advertisements, and because his fee was contingent upon a specific sale being consummated, his activities were the type of activities that the legislature contemplated in licensing real estate brokers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Cleveland Municipal Court (Ohio), which found defendant guilty of pandering obscenity in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.32(A)(4) and sentenced her to 60 days imprisonment and a fine. The trial judge stayed execution of the sentence pending the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged her conviction for pandering obscenity. The court found that the trial judge was not required personally to view the film prior to issuing a search warrant. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. Defendant also challenged the sufficiency of the affidavit supporting the search warrant. However, the affidavit had not been made a part of the record on appeal. The court found no merit in defendant's allegation that the definition of obscenity in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.01(F) was both overbroad and vague. The statute was neither overly broad nor vague because the jury was instructed initially under the state statute, and then was given a &quot;narrowing&quot; instruction restricting the definition of obscenity in accordance with case law guidelines. The trial court did not impermissibly restrict the scope of defense counsel's inquiry during voir dire. Additionally, it was sufficient to sustain the conviction that defendant had knowledge of the character, not necessarily the content, of the material. The jury had sufficient evidence to convict defendant. Finally, the court concluded that the film at issue was obscene.</SPAN></P>

The widow had filed an application for death benefits on February 24, 1975, alleging that her husband's exposure to chromates from 1947 to 1965 while employed with respondent employer resulted in his death on October 9, 1974.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission dismissed the widow's application for failure to meet the jurisdictional requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.68(Y). The Commission found that the last injurious exposure to chromates occurred on May 26, 1954 and that the decedent did not become totally disabled due to such exposure within eight years of that date. The widow contended that the eight-year jurisdictional requirements of &sect; 4123.68(Y) arbitrarily discriminated against classes of workers and were not based on any rational purpose. The court denied mandamus relief. The court held that where the record contained some evidence which supported the factual findings of the Commission, a writ of mandamus would not lie. Here, sufficient evidence supported the Commission's factual findings. Further, the court concluded that &sect; 4123.68(Y) was constitutional. Since &sect; 4123.68(Y) was not per se arbitrary, the widow had the burden of producing evidence showing it to be a rule enacted arbitrarily for &quot;administrative ease.&quot; She failed to meet this burden.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with premeditated murder and felony murder after he broke into a woman's house and killed her. While the police were in defendant's yard for the purpose of arresting him, an officer noticed a holster lying inside the house. After being twice advised of his rights and twice indicating that he understood them, defendant, in response to an officer's question, stated that he had killed the victim. The holster and defendant's statement were later admitted at trial. On appeal from defendant's conviction and sentence, the court held that: (1) the trial court's imposition of the death sentence was unconstitutional; (2) the trial court properly admitted the holster into evidence because it fell within the plain view of the officer; (3) the trial court properly admitted defendant's statement into evidence because defendant's response to the officer's question indicated a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights; and (4) although the State was not required to elect between the two murder charges, defendant, pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The builder's association members brought suit against the city challenging several ordinances regulating various construction fees. The trial court determined, among other things, that the city's sewer tap-in fees in excess of the administrative cost to inspect the tap for connecting to its sewage system, pursuant to Amherst, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 913.07, were invalid. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the municipal home rule provision in Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 4 granted the municipality power to impose a tap-in fee that bore a reasonable relationship to the entire cost of providing sewage service to the new user, as opposed to merely charging the tap-in cost. The test of reasonableness was not the amount of the charge, but the basis for the charge. The court found that the city's tap-in charge under Amherst, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 913.07 bore a definite relationship to the maintenance and operation of the present system, as well as the expense of planning operations for the building of additional facilities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the death sentence imposed on him was contrary to law based on two holdings from the U.S. Supreme Court in which Ohio Rev.

The court ruled that to hold otherwise would violate the court's duty to follow precedent set by the state supreme court, would deny defendant the equal protection of the laws, and would be contrary to statute. The court observed that when the two cases were remanded by the Court to the state supreme court, the latter court reduced to life imprisonment the death sentences in 54 capital cases then pending before it. To subject defendant to a death sentence for a violation of the same law as was violated by 54 other defendants whose sentences were reduced to life imprisonment would patently be a violation of the equal protection clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions. Moreover, because the death penalty had been invalidated and because under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.03 criminal liability had to be based upon a statute or ordinance that prohibited an act and provided a penalty, there was no authority to impose a death penalty.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the trial court must consider a postconviction petition in strict accordance with &sect; 2953.21. There was no question that the trial court failed to comply with the postconviction statute in overruling defendant's motion to vacate the judgment and set aside the sentence.

Defendant testified that she had been in the hotel's restaurant before, but had never been in the hotel bar. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 2907.24. The court affirmed the conviction and noted that because the constitutionality of the statute was not raised below, the court would consider the issue only if it was plain error. Because &sect; 2907.24 was not unconstitutional on its face, the issue did not require the court's consideration. With regard to defendant's argument that the evidence did not support her conviction, the court held that her approach, the proposition, and tenor of the conversation implied solicitation as defined under &sect; 2907.24. In view of defendant's failure to refute the testimony of the detective, and considering the evidence as a whole, the court held that sufficient evidence was adduced to support the verdict of guilty returned by the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company hired the contractor to paint the company's water towers. The parties signed an agreement with an indemnity clause. During the work, a painter fell from a water tower and was injured. He brought suit against the company and lost. The company then filed suit against the contractor for indemnification. The trial court found in favor of the company. The contractor appealed and the court reversed. The court found that the passage of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.31, making indemnification clauses void, after the events of this suit took place did not apply because the statute was prospective and not retroactive. The indemnification clause was void because strictly construed as required by prior judicial guidelines, the clause did not place a clear unequivocal duty upon the contractor to either indemnify or defend claims based upon the sole negligence of the company. The principle of strict construction as to an indemnification clause was equally applicable to a correlative duty to defend. Strictly construed, no such duty to defend was placed upon the contractor when acts of the company's own negligence were the sole basis for an action against the company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant operated an adult bookstore. He was convicted of pandering obscenity and appealed. Defendant claimed that Ohio's definition of obscenity contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.01(F) was overbroad and vague. The court disagreed and determined that the trial judge properly instructed the jury under the statute and gave the jury a &quot;narrowing&quot; instruction restricting the definition of obscenity. Defendant claimed that a film and projector were seized in violation of his constitutional rights. The court found that the description contained in an officer's affidavit for a search warrant was sufficient and enabled the magistrate to consider the film as a whole to determine whether the film lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Defendant's motion for acquittal for properly denied because reasonable minds could have differed as to whether knowledge of the character of the film was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The court concluded that the film, taken as a whole, appealed to prurient interest, that it depicted sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and that it lacked any serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the landowner contended that the trial court erred when it did not conduct an actual hearing on the issues. The landowner also contended that the trial court's committed prejudicial error when it affirmed an arbitrary and unreasonable administrative decision, and when it did not declare the zoning ordinances unconstitutional as applied to the landowner. The court held that the a hearing was not required. The court held that, given the presumption of regularity and the fact that the record reflected that a trial was had, it was assumed that the landowner was afforded an adequate opportunity to present his case.

The court originally found defendant to be insane and committed him to the state hospital pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.38.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found to be insane and was committed to a mental hospital pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.38. A judgment entry of such finding and commitment was entered on the journal of the trial court. Defendant was restored to reason and returned from the mental hospital. The court found that the trial court erred in failing to enter on its journal a judgment indicating that defendant has been restored to reason before proceeding to try the defendant. However, no prejudice was shown by defendant as a result of the error under Ohio R. Crim. P. 52 (A). The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that he had the burden of proving his insanity by a preponderance of the evidence. The court noted that while the common law rule governing the burden of proof changed with the enactment of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05, the change was only applicable to criminal trials held after January 1, 1974, and not to defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant property owner challenged the dismissal of an action for a declaration that a zoning ordinance limiting the use of the property to single-family dwellings was unconstitutional. The property owner purchased the land, knowing that the deed and appellee city's zoning laws restricted the property to single-family homes. As a result of development over the years, including the construction of a six-lane highway abutting the property, the property owner argued that a substantial change in the character of the neighborhood rendered the property undesirable for single family use. The trial court dismissed the complaint after the property owner presented evidence and rested. The appellate court reversed the judgment of dismissal after providing a thorough analysis of the issues and relief available in a declaratory judgment action attacking the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance. The appellate court held that because of the uniqueness of the property, the changed circumstances, and the cost of improvements for single-family use, the property owner had clearly demonstrated the unconstitutionality of the single-family zoning of its property and was entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

The city, through its housing department, cited the property owner for violating two city ordinances and notified him to remove his signs. One of the ordinances regulated permitted accessory uses in residential districts. As to that ordinance, the property owner argued that the trial court erred in relying upon that ordinance and ordering the property owner's sign removed because the ordinance in question was permissive rather than prohibitive. The court held that the ordinance was not permissive in that it specifically limited a zoning classification to certain uses, which by implication prohibited all others. The property owner also argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional as an infringement upon his rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 11. In light of the broad restriction of the ordinance, the court held it to be unconstitutional in its present form as an infringement of the property owner's right to exercise his freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The passenger filed a negligence action to recover damages for personal injuries she sustained when an automobile in which she was riding struck a utility pole. The suit claimed that the driver operated the vehicle in a negligent manner and that the owner entrusted the automobile to his son knowing the son to be an incompetent driver. Between the time of the collision and the filing of the suit, the passenger and the car's owner married. The owner then filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted based on interspousal immunity. The passenger appealed. She contended that the trial court erred deprived her of equal protection and a remedy by due course of law and denied her due process of law. The court disagreed, holding that because the passenger did not raise these constitutional arguments in opposition to the owner's motion for summary judgment, the court could not consider them on appeal. The interspousal immunity doctrine, with its inherent differential treatment of spouses and non-spouses, reasonably related to the legitimate State interest of fostering marital harmony and preventing fraud and collusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a corporation and its principal officer, brought an action against defendants, a city, consulting engineers, and owners of property adjacent to a subdivision plaintiffs were developing, to recoup some of the expenses of water and sewer line improvements. The Lucas County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) granted three motions to dismiss and two motions for summary judgment, all against plaintiffs. Plaintiffs sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In order to comply with a requirement that it construct and pay for water and sewer lines in a new subdivision, the corporation had to build connecting lines along existing streets. Instead of seeking proportionate assessment of costs under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 727.01 et. seq., the corporation chose to proceed by petition. None of the ordinances passed by the city included a &quot;pay to tap&quot; provision. The court upheld the summary judgment for the city because the city had the authority to require the installation of the lines and was not legally obligated to include &quot;pay to tap&quot; provisions. The court affirmed the dismissal of plaintiffs' quasi-contract claims against the owners, who benefited from the construction, because the owners had no obligation to install sewer or water lines when the corporation built the improvements and it would have been unjust to grant plaintiffs relief. The court found that summary judgment for the engineers was proper because the claim that the engineers breached a contractual duty by not securing &quot;pay to tap&quot; provisions should have been raised as a compulsory counterclaim in the engineers' prior action against the corporation to collect unpaid fees.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued on appeal that the warrant was defective because the issuing judge had not personally viewed the film. The court ruled that it was not mandatory for the magistrate to view a film prior to issuing a warrant for its seizure as long as the affidavit was constitutionally acceptable. The court found that the warrant was constitutionally sufficient in that it accurately described the contents to be seized and probable cause had been established.

The court held that: (1) precise knowledge of the contents of obscene material was not a prerequisite to an obscenity conviction, the prosecution had to prove only that defendant had knowledge of the character of the materials; (2) because knowledge of the content of the magazine was not an element of the crime of pandering obscenity, the omission of the word &quot;content&quot; from the complaint was not a defect; (3) the court's instruction was not erroneous; (4) Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As he stood behind the counter, defendant could see sexual devices and pornographic magazines on display for sale, as well as pictures promoting the allegedly pornographic film, which patrons could view for 25 cents. Defendant claimed the search warrant was defective because the judge did not personally view the film and the officer's affidavit did not state that the film lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. He argued that the complaint failed to allege all the material elements of the offense and that the trial court should have instructed the jury that the State had to prove that defendant had knowledge of the film's content as well as its character. Affirming the judgment, the court held that the judge who issued the warrant did not have to view the film, that the supporting affidavit did not have to parrot, in conclusory terms, Miller v. California's three-pronged obscenity test, and that the facts alleged were sufficient to establish probable cause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a cashier, argued on equal protection grounds that the entire statute governing the pandering of obscenity, Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2907.35(C), to be an unconstitutional violation of equal protection. Section 2907.35(C) had provided that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2907.31 and 2907.32 did not apply to a motion picture operator or projectionist acting within the scope of his employment as an employee of the owner or manager of a theatre or other place for the showing of motions pictures to the general public. On appeal, the court reaffirmed its prior decision that its invalidation of the qualified projectionist exemption contained in Ohio Rev.

Defendant was charged with and convicted of pandering obscenity, contrary to &sect; 2907.32(A)(2). On appeal, defendant alleged error in the denial of his motion for acquittal because the prosecution had not proved an essential element of the crime, that &sect; 2907.32(A)(2) was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, that he was denied equal protection under the law, and that the newspaper was not legally obscene. The court affirmed. It was not necessary to prove precise knowledge of the contents of the newspaper, only its character. The definition of obscenity in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.01(F) was not overbroad or vague because the jury was properly instructed on that issue. Defendant was not denied equal protection because the exclusion from culpability in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.35(C) had been overturned. Finally, the jury had not erred in its determination that the newspaper was obscene.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a police officers' association and five patrolmen, sought review of a decision from the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which ruled in favor of appellee, the City of Parma, Ohio, and found Parma City, Ohio, Ordinance 83-73 to be constitutional and enforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under the terms of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5923.05, an employee of a political subdivision of the state received both his city pay and military pay while in military service on field training or active duty, for up to 31 days in a calendar year. Under Parma City, Ohio Ordinance No. 83-73, he received the difference between city pay and military pay. It appeared obvious that the city ordinance and the state law were in conflict in the matter of pay to the city employee-soldier. The court found that under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3, a chartered municipality was authorized to exercise all powers of local self-government and could adopt a pay schedule for city employees on leave of absence for military service. A conflict with a state statute would not be fatal to such an ordinance. However, an ordinance passed by a noncharter city which was at variance with a state statute was invalid. Since the City of Parma was not a chartered city, the ordinance was invalid under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3, because it was in conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5923.05.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court reversed and remanded the trial court's dismissal. The court held it was clear that defendant demonstrated that other &quot;men's magazines&quot; with a format similar were not yet being prosecuted. It was also shown that such magazines were being sold in the same sort of stores as that of defendant and that the authorities were aware of their existence and general content. The court further held that absent testimony from his superiors, however, there was no reliable basis upon which the trial court could have inferred that the state would not have followed up a successful result in defendant's case with additional prosecutions. The court found that the trial court had before it no substantial evidence to support a conclusion that defendant's magazine alone would have been prosecuted, much less that this selectivity was based on constitutionally prohibited discrimination. The court concluded that defendant failed to meet his burden of presenting at least testimony of an individual responsible for deciding the intended course of prosecutions of magazines of the same format.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioners properly considered testimony by the township trustees about a proposed new volunteer fire station to be located in the area sought to be annexed. The township trustees were not prohibited from testifying about the general good of the territory to be transferred from their jurisdiction. There was conflicting evidence because the municipality and the township each claimed that it could furnish better services at less cost than the other.

Code Ann. &sect; 1533.181(A) and which dismissed the entire cases as only private parties remained as defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.181(A) provided that no owner or lessee of premises owed any duty to a recreational user to keep the premises safe for use. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.18(B) defined &quot;recreational user&quot; as a person to whom permission had been granted, without the payment of a fee, other than a fee paid to the State or any agency thereof, to enter upon the premises to engage in recreational pursuits. The court held the trial court had properly interpreted this statute as requiring dismissal of plaintiffs' suits. The Ohio Supreme Court had held that the State was entitled to the benefit of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.181(A). Further, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.18(B), in defining a &quot;recreational user,&quot; included a person who paid a fee to the State. Thus, plaintiffs' payment of a fee for use of the parks did not take them out of the recreational user category. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.181 did not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The classification bore a reasonable relationship to the legitimate state purpose of encouraging owners to open their land for public recreation without worry about liability.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court dismissed her action, the claimant asserted on appeal that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to declare any provision of the silicosis statute unconstitutional and that she was entitled to appeal to the court because the Commission was unable to provide her an adequate remedy. Appellees asserted the exhaustion defense. The court affirmed. It found that appellees' answer was properly before the court. Also, the claimant's assertion that appellees were estopped from raising their defense because of representations in a prior case that declaratory judgment was an appropriate remedy had no merit. Finally, appellees' defense was not absolute, but because the claimant had an appeal pending before the Commission, no need existed to reach the constitutional issues until resolution of that appeal.</SPAN></P>

The company contended that the self-referential phrase created an ambiguity amounting to a constitutional question as to whether there could be any retail sale of fireworks in Ohio. The court acknowledged that the self-reference in &sect; 3743.32 was an obvious mistake, concluding that it was also obvious that the legislature intended that &sect; 3743.32 reference Ohio Rev.

The court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3743.32 generally prohibited retail sales of fireworks in Ohio, and further that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3743.33 provided an exception to the general prohibition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A plainclothes officer entered defendant's bookshop and noticed several adult magazines covered in plastic. After the officer purchased one the magazines, defendant admitted to hiring someone to cover the magazines with plastic. On appeal from his conviction, defendant contended, among other things, that the magazine should have been suppressed because the officer's search of the store violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.32(A)(2) was overbroad and vague, and that he was entitled to an acquittal because the State failed to prove an essential element of the crime. The court held that there was no search and seizure in the case because a purchase of a magazine by a plainclothes officer in a shop that is open to the public did not constitute a search and seizure for constitutional purposes. The court relied on prior precedent, which upheld the statutory definition of obscenity as not being unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. Even though defendant claimed that he did not have knowledge of the magazine's content, it was sufficient that the State proved that defendant knew the character of the material.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss a charge of pandering obscenity under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.32(A)(4), asserting that the Ohio definition of obscenity in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.01(F) was unconstitutional. After the Cleveland Municipal Court (Ohio) denied his motion, he entered a plea of no contest. Defendant appealed after he was found guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A patrolman viewed a movie in the shop where defendant worked as a cashier. Deeming the film obscene, the policeman went to the trial court and obtained a search warrant and a warrant for the arrest of defendant. The following day, the patrolman returned to the shop, seized the movie, and arrested defendant. Defendant argued that the definition of obscenity in the Ohio statute was unconstitutional because it was vague, overbroad, and did not conform to the Miller guidelines prescribed by the United States Supreme Court. The court explained that the Miller tests for defining obscenity were incorporated into the Ohio statute by an authoritative state court construction specifically sanctioned. The court added that the Ohio statute was extremely precise in defining what conduct was prohibited. Noting that the record was silent as to what transpired at the hearing, the court said that it must presume that the trial court, in finding defendant guilty of pandering obscenity, authoritatively construed Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.01(F) to incorporate the Miller guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff trailer park brought a forcible entry and detainer action against defendant tenant, seeking restitution of the premises on the ground that the tenant was holding over the term of the monthly tenancy, which began prior to the effective date of the New Mobile Home Owners Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3733.01 et seq. The tenant appealed an order from the Barberton Municipal Court, Summit County (Ohio), granting the park restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenant, an owner of a mobile home, placed her home in the park under a month-to-month tenancy. The tenant first contended that a forcible entry and detainer action could not be maintained against her. Next, she argued that she was entitled to a one-year rental agreement pursuant to the Act. In her last contention, she asserted that if Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3733.11(A) applied only to new tenants who installed mobile homes after the Act's effective date, then she was a member of a class denied the equal protection of the laws under the United States and Ohio Constitutions. In upholding the trial court's order, the court rejected her contentions. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1923.02(J) specifically provided that forcible entry and detainer actions could be brought against a house trailer tenant who breached the terms of a rental agreement. Holding over a term constituted a breach. Because the Act was intended to be prospectively applied, the tenant was not entitled to a one-year rental agreement. Finally, in assuming that a classification did exist, the court found that it rested on grounds relevant to the Act's purpose: to curb abuses that were occurring in the trailer park industry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed their convictions and sentences entered in the Fulton County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), pursuant to a jury trial wherein defendants were found guilty of one count each of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.01 and grand theft in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were hired by a woman to murder her, and she paid them several thousand dollars. When she changed her mind, defendants refused to return her money. Defendants asserted that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury regarding the requirements for supporting evidence for the testimony of co-conspirators as set out in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.01(H). The court held that because &sect; 2923.01(H) was not an element of the offense of conspiracy, no instruction was required. At trial, a chemist testified that the weight of 13 doxepin capsules given to the woman by defendants to be ingested by her for the alleged purpose of causing her death was 3.1 grams. The State's medical expert testified that 3.1 grams of doxepin was a lethal dose. The court took judicial notice that the correct weight of the drug contained in the capsules was .325 gram. There was no evidence that .325 gram was a lethal dosage of doxepin; thus, the record was devoid of proof of purpose to commit, promote, or facilitate the commission of aggravated murder. The court held that there was sufficient credible evidence to support the jury's verdict of guilt as to the charge of theft by deception.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment as to the convictions for conspiracy to commit aggravated murder. The court affirmed the judgment as to the convictions for grand theft. The court remanded the case for execution of sentence as to the grand theft convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with selling Phentermine, a controlled substance. His motion to dismiss the indictment because Phentermine was not a controlled substance was denied. Defendant pleaded no contest and the trial court found him guilty of selling a controlled substance. On appeal, defendant contended that Phentermine was not listed as a controlled substance in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.41. The trial court's judgment of conviction was affirmed. The court held that the indictment correctly spelled the substance and added a term, Adipex-p, which more specifically identified the compound. Further, the court held that the spelling correction did not operate to create a new law but merely changed the spelling of the word to conform to reality. Such action did not prejudice defendant because of his inability to know what actions were proscribed by the law because the intention of the legislature in listing the substance was clear. The delegation of authority in the Ohio Department of Pharmacy to amend the schedules as set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.44 was not an unconstitutional delegation of power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurer filed a request for an increase in rates for categories of its coverage. The Superintendent denied the request. However, the trial court reversed the order denying the request, and the Superintendent sought review. The court held that the trial court was required to support the Superintendent's order unless if failed to contain reliable, substantial, and probative evidence in support of it. The court found that the order was arbitrary and discriminatory. The court determined that the insurer had made a good faith effort in the cost containment areas. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1739.01(M), such good faith effort was defined as a continuing attempt to control costs and encourage member health care facilities to control costs. The court found that, although the insurer's organizations were in a position to persuade and influence they had no final authority in the area of health care. The court held that, although the Superintendent's order was arbitrary, the rule-making process was not unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed in part and modified in part the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
