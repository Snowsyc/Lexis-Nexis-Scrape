The court determined that a specific right of appeal of a suspension was given in &sect; 813(b) of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code. After reviewing both sections, the court held that they should be considered together and that the discretionary suspension authorized by &sect; 823(f) of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code was entitled to be appealed. The court held that such a construction avoided a determination that &sect; 823(f) was unconstitutional by depriving a suspended person of due process or equal protection. The court found that the Pennsylvania Administrative Agency Law did not apply to the Department of Revenue, Bureau of Motor Vehicles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The businessmen owned a lot on the east side of a city street, which was zoned D-1 residential but contained a factory, gasoline station, private garages, auto repair shop, and one residence. After unsuccessfully applying for a variance for a retail dry cleaning store, the businessmen secured a variance for a restaurant. After building a restaurant on the northern half of the lot and securing a liquor license, the businessmen unsuccessfully sought a variance to construct and operate a shoe repair shop and grocery store and then unsuccessfully sought a variance to expand the restaurant. On the sustained appeal, the court directed the zoning board of adjustment to issue the necessary variance and use registration permit to the businessmen to permit them to expand their restaurant by finding that the board improperly refused the variance and abused its discretion in order to exert a measure of control over the businessmen's operations under their liquor license. The court disregarded the board's findings, which were not supported by the evidence and had little relationship to its function. The residential classification was a zoning anomaly that needed to be rectified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a corporation and municipal officials, filed preliminary objections to the equity action brought by plaintiff property owners.

The owners contended that the disputed reclassification ordinance effected arbitrary and capricious changes and deprived the owners of the peaceable enjoyment of their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed preliminary objections raised by defendants in response to the owners' complaint challenging the amending ordinance reclassifying the corporation's property from &quot;class A residential&quot; to partly &quot;class B residential&quot; and partly class &quot;shopping center.&quot; Defendants asserted that the owners' complaint did not set forth an equity cause of action, and that the statutory remedy under the Pennsylvania Voting Act of May 6, 1929 was exclusive, and an equity action could not be substituted for a direct appeal to the local zoning board of adjustment. The court sustained defendants' objections based on its determination that (1) the availability of a remedy as set forth in the Act precluded the maintenance of the owners' action; and (2) the owners could not seek a change of zoning classification in an equity action because equity jurisdiction did not lie to enjoin an ordinance's enforcement when the statutory remedy of raising an appeal with the local board of adjustment pursuant to &sect; 3829 was the owners' exclusive remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This matter was before the court on the preliminary objections filed by defendant Pennsylvania Department of Revenue to the complaint in equity filed by plaintiffs, owner and operator, to enjoin the enforcement of orders of the Pennsylvania Secretary of Revenue indefinitely suspending plaintiffs' motor vehicle privileges for their failure to post security for damages resulting from a highway accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator was involved in an accident while operating a truck belonging to the owner. The action to recover damages brought by the other party was pending and, based on an expert estimate of damages, the Secretary determined the amount sufficient to satisfy any judgment that might be recovered against plaintiffs. He directed plaintiffs to file security in that sum or a general release from the other party. Plaintiffs did not comply with those directions and their motor vehicle privileges were suspended. Plaintiffs then sought to restrain the enforcement of the orders of suspension claiming that they would irreparably damage their trucking business. The court dismissed the complaint for want of jurisdiction. It found that the State had the right to regulate the manner under which and by whom motor vehicles were operated on its highways. Further, &sect; 2(b) of the Responsibility Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 75, &sect; 1277.2(b), provided a method to challenge the Secretary's order and plaintiffs elected to circumvent that remedy by filing a complaint in equity on the bare allegation that they would suffer irreparable damage if the orders of the Secretary were enforced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, proposed purchasers of a portion of land, sought review of the decision of appellee Board of Supervisors of Whitemarsh Township, which denied the owners of the land permission to subdivide a portion of the land that the proposed purchasers wished to buy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed purchasers petitioned the township under the Act of May 24, 1951, P.L. 370, &sect; 16, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 19093-1251 et seq. to permit the owners of the property to subdivide the land so that the purchasers could buy a portion of it. The township Board denied the petition. The purchasers brought an action against the township that sought a review de novo of the township's action. The court dismissed the purchasers' appeal. The court noted that the township had failed to state in writing the reasons for its denial of permission, as it was required to do under the Act of May 24, 1951, P.L. 370, &sect; 16, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect;&sect; 19093-1255 and 1256(a). Even though its review was de novo, the court held that proper order required the township to complete its action first. The court further ruled that, even if the township had provided its reasons, the purchasers had no standing to bring the appeal. They were not aggrieved persons under the meaning of the statute. They were not owners, had not entered into a contract to buy the property, and had not given up other property in order to buy this land. They had no direct, pecuniary interest in the township's action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractor filed a mechanic's lien claim against defendant owner pursuant to &sect; 2 of the Pennsylvania Mechanic's Lien Act of June 4, 1901, P. L. 431, 49 PS &sect; 21, for work performed and materials supplied pursuant to a written contract and subsequent oral modifications thereto, including the leveling and demolition of buildings and the grading and filling in of the resulting plot. The owner filed a petition to strike the lien claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that a mechanic's lien could not be asserted for demolition and grading work which was not preparatory to new construction. Based on that claim, the court issued a rule to the contractor to show cause why the lien claim should not have been stricken. After a hearing, the rule was made absolute. The contractor relied on &sect; 2 as authority for the filing of the lien. However, after construing &sect; 2, the court concluded that services rendered in the demolition of a building and the grading or clearing of a plot of ground did not form a basis for the filing of a mechanic's lien claim unless such work was incidental to or preparatory to the alteration, erection, and construction of a building or other structure. Moreover, mechanic's lien legislation was special legislation that was valid only insofar as it did not create or extend such liens beyond their scope as enacted prior to the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1874, when such liens could not have been filed for demolition and removal work unrelated to an erection or construction process. Because no new construction was done or even contemplated in the case at bar, the contractor's lien claim was filed without authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rule granted upon the contractor to show cause why the mechanic's lien claim should not be stricken off was made absolute.</SPAN></P>

The Secretary of Revenue did not decide whether the parties involved in an accident were guilty of negligence in any way. He did not attempt to fix the amount of any damages. He was merely empowered to perform the administrative act of requiring the posting of what he considered to be adequate security for the payment of any damages when the questions pertaining to the amount of damages and the persons entitled thereto had been judicially determined.</SPAN></P>

The secretary of welfare, the general state authority, and the executive director filed preliminary objections to the bill on the ground that the citizens failed to state that they paid taxes into the funds of the general state authority. The court ruled that a taxpayer seeking to enjoin the expenditure of public funds must allege with particularity that he was a taxpayer to the very fund which he sought to restrain. Further, the court held that the judicial power to interfere in cases challenging acts of a character committed to the discretion of public officials was exceedingly limited. Also, the court found that the citizens failed to allege in their complaint, nor could they prove, any pecuniary interest in the general state authority's funds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was committed to the county prison for public drunkenness. Petitioner challenged his commitment by the magistrate by filing an application for a writ of habeas corpus. The court noted that the magistrate was authorized to make such commitment based on Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, &sect;&sect; 722, 671 et seq. Petitioner first argued that these sections were unconstitutional because the subject of confinement of drunkards did not appear in the title. The court noted that the title of an act did not have to be an index of its contents. Accordingly, the acts were constitutional. Petitioner then urged that the sections were superseded by the Mental Health Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 50, &sect; 2105. The court did not conclude that &sect; 2105 was intended to supersede or repeal Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 47, &sect;&sect; 722, 671 et seq. Rather, the criminal statutes addressed single incidents of public drunkenness and the mental health statutes address habitual drunkenness. Accordingly, petitioner's arguments were deemed meritless and his application was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee sought to enjoin the school board from exercising its power of condemnation with respect to its parcel of land. The board decided that the owner's land would be the most desirable location for a new school. However, because condemnation of that land would create a problem as to parking facilities for the buses, the board and the owner agreed that the board would condemn the land used by the lessee and thereafter exchange it for the owner's land which would then be used as a site for the proposed school building and playground. The lessee argued that the proposed condemnation was a condemnation for a private use and consequently beyond the power of the school district. The board argued that the proposed exchange would be &quot;in the best interests of the public&quot;. The court concluded that (1) property taken by the power of eminent domain must be taken for a public purpose and had to be used for the purpose for which taken; and (2) the question whether property was needed for school purposes or was fitted for such use was not for the court because it was an administrative matter, and, in the absence of fraud, the decision of the board was conclusive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an adjudication in equity, plaintiffs sought to have two ordinances of the Township of Hatfield (Pennsylvania) regarding taxes on trailers declared invalid and of no effect and to restrain the Supervisors of Hatfield Township (Pennsylvania) from collecting taxes imposed thereunder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs attacked the ordinances on the ground that they were ambiguous. The court agreed and decreed the ordinances illegal and unenforceable. The tax imposed by both ordinances was upon all persons owning, leasing or occupying land who caused or permitted such land to be occupied by an inhabited trailer or vehicle. The court concluded that the language of the ordinances was so vague, indefinite, uncertain and contradictory that it was impossible to determine what the Supervisors really intended. Further, the tax authorized by the enabling act, the Act of June 25, 1947 (Pennsylvania), as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 2015.1, under which the ordinances were created, only allowed a tax on the use or occupancy of house trailers. The tax imposed by the ordinances was on causing or permitting land to be occupied by trailers. A tax on causing or permitting land to be occupied by trailers exceeded the authority granted under the enabling act, which authorized a tax only on the use or occupancy of house trailers. The enabling act sustained an ordinance taxing the user or occupant of trailers, but not a tax upon the owner or lessee of the land who permitted such use or occupation.</SPAN></P>

A motion to quash the indictment was granted but upon appeal the decision was reversed with a venire.

The court held that it was defendant who secured the erroneous quashing of the indictment, and therefore appeal by the Commonwealth was necessary to correct the error. The court held that defendant must pay the Commonwealth's costs on appeal as directed by the trial jury because all were a part of his trial on one indictment. The court held that the objection to the charges for arguing the case in the superior and supreme court was sustained.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, purporting to represent metered users, unmetered users and registered plumbers, sought to restrain defendant, the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and its officials, from carrying into effect the provisions of the City's Water Rent Regulation No. 4. The complaints set forth various alleged bases for the invalidity of the City's proposed universal water metering program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs principally contended that the City's proposed universal metering program was invalid insofar as it required that all meters be furnished and set by the City. The City was affirmatively performing a function it was authorized to do without any obligation to perform such function in a manner more acceptable to or more profitable to plaintiffs. It was a sufficient basis for the City's choice of mode of procedure that the planned program was designed to inure to the benefit of the overwhelming mass of taxpayers and consumers. A consideration of the record convinced the court that the case constituted an effort by one portion of the plumbing trade to forestall a program in which they would not share. The program was fair to persons similarly situated and all consumers were to be treated identically insofar as meter replacement was concerned. The setting of meters by City employees was not the performance of a plumbing function within the meaning of the plumbing code and, in any event, the City in the setting of meters was exempted from the plumbing code. A proposed deferred payment plan was not an improper extension of the City's credit to private individuals.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the property owner's exceptions and confirmed the adjudication. The court held that the subsidiary findings of fact justified the chancellor's findings that the property owner's business was being so conducted as to constitute a nuisance. The court found that Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth contended that the Secretary's order calling for the continuation of the area control plan for the control and eradication of bang disease in the county should be affirmed because the plan was instituted at the request of large percent of the herd owners of the county and only a small portion of all the herd owners in the county had voted to discontinue the plan at a hearing before the Secretary on a petition to discontinue the plan. The cattle herd owners protesting the continuation of the plan maintained that the plan resulted in the taking and destruction of property without due process and were invalid because all the counties in the Commonwealth were not under the plan. In sustaining the Secretary's determination, the court found that the Commonwealth's police power included the power to enact statutes preventing the spread of diseases in animals and that the Acts of April 9, 1929, P. L. 177 and April 17, 1929, P. L. 533 (Pennsylvania), were within the police power vested in the State. Further, the court found that the Secretary had the power to adopt regulations to carry out the legislature's mandate and that the regulations were not discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was arrested while a parole violator and was imprisoned in Ohio. When his sentence there was completed, he was recommitted to prison in Pennsylvania to serve the remainder of his original sentence. He petitioned for writ of habeas corpus to obtain his release from the penitentiary, urging that he had been illegally detained. The court disagreed, explaining that &sect; 331.21a(b) provided that a parole violator would be recommitted for the period during which he had been delinquent with credits allowed for a period of good behavior. Section 331.21a(b) took effect after the prisoner had violated his parole but before he was apprehended and recommitted. When he was apprehended his status was that of a parolee who had been sentenced, paroled, and had become a violator. At the time of his apprehension in Ohio the maximum period of his sentence in Pennsylvania had expired. The court held that &sect; 331.21a(b) was not ex post facto because no new act had been made a crime nor had any conditions been added to parole which had not existed at the time that the prisoner was paroled.</SPAN></P>

The theft sentence was suspended and relator was recommitted. The time relator spent while incarcerated on the new charge was not used in calculating his commitment. He sought a writ of habeas corpus and the court issued a rule to show cause why the writ should not issue. The court discharged the rule and dismissed the petition. It found that Pa. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The builder submitted a subdivision plan of his premises into five lots to the township engineer accompanied by an application for approval. The township engineer refused to approve the plan unless the township sanitary sewer was extended to serve all five lots with separate connections for each lot. The builder appealed to the Board, which disapproved the subdivision plan, unless the builder installed an extension to the sanitary sewer system to serve the five properties in question in accordance with township regulations. The builder appealed, and the court dismissed his appeal. The court found that the township had the authority to dictate how land was to be subdivided. It was within the township's police power to direct that land was to be connect to the sewer system before it was improved. In view of the topography of the land, the proximity of the builder's subdivision to the existing trunk sewer, and the established policy of the township, the requirement by the township as a condition of the approval of his subdivision that the builder install a branch service sewer to serve the five lots in his tract was reasonable and proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The woman claimed that upon the fiance's breach of his promise to marry her, he refused to return the furniture given to him and refused repay a loan made to him by the woman. She sought damages for both counts. The court sustained the fiance's preliminary objection as to the furniture, but dismissed it as to the loan. The court held that that the woman's claim as to the furniture came within the prohibition of Pa. Act of June 22, 1935, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 48, &sect;&sect; 171, 172, against causes of action for breach of contract to marry. However, it held that the loan was clearly outside the statute as it was not an action for breach of contract to marry and because the contract of marriage did not give rise to the cause of action. The loan if made and not repaid gave rise to the cause of action independently of the marriage contract. The right would exist whether the engagement was broken or not or even if the parties were married.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The businessmen operated separate businesses that were the object of the city's allegedly unconstitutional ordinance. The city's preliminary objections asserted that the businessmen were misjoined as plaintiffs. The court held that the question of misjoinder of parties could not have been raised by preliminary objection inasmuch as it was not within the items enumerated in Pa. R. Civ. P. 1017(b)(1)-(5). Nowhere in Rule 1017(b) was misjoinder of parties mentioned. The only remedy for the city in the case of the misjoinder of the businessmen under Pa. R. Civ. P. 2229(a) was to file a petition for severance of the businessmen. Moreover, the filing of a petition for severance did not interrupt this duty of the city to plead unless a stay order had been entered by the court.

The buyer answered, claiming that the title to the property was not a &quot;good marketable and legal title&quot; and counterclaimed for the return of his deposit. The sellers filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer contended that a deed of the wife of a predecessor in title to her husband was defective by reason on the failure of her husband to join in the deed. The buyer also asserted that the will and codicil of the husband devised a fee to his daughter and not a life interest to her with remainder to one of the sellers. Finally, the buyer argued that the sellers' title was not good, marketable and legal. The court held that the Act of June 3, 1911, P. L. 631, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 48, &sect; 71, authorized a married woman to convey to her husband without his joinder. The court found, therefore, that the wife's conveyance to her husband was valid and did not require her husband's joinder. The court also determined that, by the language in his will and codicil, the husband intended to limit the daughter to a life estate with the remainder to one of the sellers. Finally, the court concluded that the title tendered by the sellers was good and marketable and that the sellers' motion for judgment on the pleadings should be granted. The court found that there was no threatened claim by anyone against the title and that if such were made it would by manifestly and undoubtedly unfounded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff purchasers filed a complaint in equity for the purpose of compelling defendant sellers to perform specifically an agreement to sell real estate. The case came before the court upon preliminary objections to the answer, which alleged a restrictive racial covenant, in the nature of a demurrer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a contract had been signed, the sellers refused to deliver a deed by reason of a covenant running with the land that said land could not be sold, transferred, leased or rented to any person of negro descent, as were purchasers. The court noted that the United States Supreme Court had held that the action of a state court in enforcing such a covenant violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Among the civil rights intended to be protected from discriminatory state action was the right to acquire, enjoy, own, and dispose of property. When a state court enforced such a restrictive covenant, the state denied purchasers the equal protection of the laws and therefore the action of the state court could not stand. Freedom from discrimination by the states in the enjoyment of property rights was among the basic objectives sought to be effectuated by the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment. That such discrimination had occurred was clear. Because of race or color the purchasers had been denied rights of ownership or occupancy enjoyed as a matter of course by other citizens of different race or color, so the court held that the restrictive covenant was null and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the covenant was contrary to public policy and was unenforceable, null, and void.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner sought to restrain defendant telephone company from using for television transmission purposes a certain strip of land, acquired by the exercise of the right of eminent domain, in which the telephone company had installed a line or cable in connection with the operation of its telephone or telegraph business. The telephone company filed preliminary objections to the complaint and depositions were taken.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner conceded that the issue was limited to whether the telephone company could be enjoined from using the land for television transmission purposes. The power of the telephone company to appropriate private property derived from the Pennsylvania Act of June 5, 1947, Pa. P. L. 424, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 2297. Under the Pennsylvania Supplemental Act of May 1, 1876, Pa. P. L. 90, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 2311, the business of the telephone company was not limited merely to the transmission of oral or written messages or information. It had the right to transact any business in which electrical impulses conveyed by means of wire might be applied to any useful purpose, and television transmission was clearly within the scope of such business. The many matters of public concern which were served through the medium of television, as well as the fact that the telephone company was regulated in all of its activities by orders of the Federal Communications Commission, clearly established the public character of its business. The fact that television broadcasts were subsidized by advertisers for their private gain did not detract from that public character.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for violating the state law against solicitation of money for benevolent purposes without a certificate of registration. She was charged with three separate violations, soliciting orally in public, via the mail, and in a paid newspaper advertisement. The statute against solicitation provided for a small fine and imprisonment for a first offense. After a second offense, the fine and term of imprisonment were increased. Defendant moved to quash the indictment for the failure to allege a first conviction under the lesser sentence before charging for second violations under the stiffer penalties. The court granted the motion to quash the indictment. The court held that where a statute applied increasing penalties for successive violations, the prior conviction had to have been alleged in the indictment. This precedent was consistent with the purpose of increasing the severity of punishment. The first conviction was a warning of sterner treatment if the repeat offender was not rehabilitated after the first conviction.</SPAN></P>

The matter was before the court on what was alleged to have been an erroneous overruling of defendant's objection to the admission of a certificate of speedometer accuracy showing that the speedometer of the arresting officer had been tested as required by law and found to be accurate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant contended at the time of argument that the admission of the certificate was improper because: (1) The facts stated on the certificate without other evidence were mere hearsay evidence and rendered the certificate inadmissible, and (2) The statute providing for the admissibility of such certificates, the Act of May 1, 1929, P. L. 905, &sect; 1002(d) (1), as amended, was unconstitutional because it violated Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 relative to meeting witnesses face to face, i.e., cross-examination. On appeal, the court stated that defendant appeared to have waived his contentions by making them at the time of argument rather than making them at trial, but in the interest of justice it decided to review the matter. The court found no merit in defendant's first contention, noting that the Act if 1929 was amended by the Act of June 27, 1939, P. L. 1135, &sect; 23 to make such certificates prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the speedometer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners filed two actions in equity to restrain defendants, a city and its officials, from enforcing an ordinance that changed the zoning classification of an area of land from residential to &quot;least restricted&quot; to enable the city to construct an incinerator on that site. Defendants filed preliminary objections to the complaints alleging a lack of equity jurisdiction in the court and a lack of substance in the complaints.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners contended that the change in classification was arbitrary and capricious and that they would suffer irreparable injury because the incinerator would produce pollution. Defendants contended that the landowners failed to exercise the exclusive statutory legal remedy in &sect; 8 of the Act of May 6, 1929, 1929 Pa. Laws 1551, as preserved by the Home Rule Charter. The court held that, despite the policy of exhaustion of administrative remedies, the factor of nuisance provided a basis for equity jurisdiction. The court decided that the landowners' allegations established prima facie that a condition injurious to the health and welfare of neighboring landowners would result. The court could not conclude in advance of a hearing that the landowners' averments were capricious. To the contrary, the court found that the complaints alleged a public and private nuisance entitling the landowners to equitable relief. The court ruled that equity jurisdiction existed to restrain a nuisance in a residential neighborhood that would deleteriously affect the health and welfare of those dwelling there. The court considered the nuisance as potentially reducing the properties' market value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The swimming club owned property in the township and a neighboring township. On the property, the swimming club operated a swimming pool, a wading pool, and other attractions. There were varying methods of gaining entry to the attractions. Some members paid a yearly fee, while others paid an amount every time they entered. The school directors enacted a regulation to assess a tax on admission paid for amusements, and the directors determined that the swimming club was subject to the tax. The court held that the swimming pool was the main portion of the swimming club's business and, because it was located in the township, it was subject to the tax. The court further found that the swimming club was an amusement and was subject to the tax. However, the court determined that the method of taxation was in violation of the Act of June 25, 1947, P.L. 1145, as amended by &sect; 1 of the Act of May 9, 1949, P.L. 898, Pa. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accountant maintained his sole office in Philadelphia and resided in another county. The accountant contended that the regulations, which provided for a tax on all proceeds of services whether or not earned in Philadelphia, were invalid. The court found that the regulations raised constitutional issues, in that they did not require a professional with a branch office in the City to include within its gross receipts business done outside the City limits while requiring all business done within the City limits to be subject to the tax. Another constitutional issue raised was the denial of substantive due process in attempting to tax activities performed without the City's borders. However, the court did not pass on the constitutional issues but instead concluded that the regulations were invalid as a usurpation of legislative power by an administrative agency as an attempt at taxation that went beyond the grant of power ceded to the City. The court held that not only had the agency legislated in promulgating the regulation, it had written a provision that was at variance with the express terms of the ordinance, which limited taxes to business actually transacted in the City.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the provisions of the regulation under the Ordinance were invalid, held that the City was perpetually restrained from enforcing or attempting to enforce the regulation, and held that the City was ordered to bear costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The interstate carrier's action in federal district court was stayed so that a state court could determine the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code.

The commander filed a petition for a declaratory judgment to determine whether Pa. Stat.

The court was not asked to determine whether the section was unconstitutional. The court declared that the section was severable from the remaining vehicle code and that there was no showing that the section was inseparable from the other sections of the act that related to weight limitations. The court determined that the section was severable under section 105 of the Act of May 1, 1929, P. L. 905 and under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 46, &sect; 555.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the mayor of a city. Before his term expired, defendant was indicted for unlawfully and fraudulently withholding and converting public money. He filed a motion to quash the indictment. Upon review, the court denied the motion. The court held that the statute of limitations in the Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 427, &sect; 77, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 211, governed the indictment against defendant. The court determined that the statute of limitations did not bar the indictment because the indictment was not filed more than two years after defendant ceased to occupy the office of mayor or more than six years after the commission of the offense. Therefore, the court rejected defendant's contention that the indictment was time-barred. The court also rejected defendant's assertion that the Act violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution because it prescribed a different statute of limitations for certain crimes when the defendant was a public official. The court ruled that the equal protection clause did not prohibit laws that applied different procedures to different classes of persons who committed the same offense.</SPAN></P>

He claimed that the ordinance unconstitutionally discriminated against him because it applied only to a method of doing business, was an unreasonable attempt at classification under the police power, and was unconstitutional as lacking uniformity. The court dismissed defendant's appeal, holding that the registration requirement was nothing more than a most reasonable regulation on the part of the borough in order that its officials could know where the machines were located and who was responsible for their maintenance and operation. The borough had the right to attach a reasonable license fee for registration and grant a permit to cover a part of the costs of policing the machines.</SPAN></P>

The board disapproved the plan on the ground that the trust company refused to accede to the requirement of the board that it construct a trunk sewer mainly across lands of others. The trust company argued that the action of the board was arbitrary, discriminatory, contrary to law, and imposed an illegal and unconstitutional burden on the trust company's land. The court determined that the ordinance in question had not been validly passed under &sect; 3601 of the First Class Township Code, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 19092-3061. However, the court determined that the question had not been brought before it in a proper proceeding. The court determined that the township, as a prerequisite to the approval of a subdivision plan, could not legally require the trust company to build, over private lands that it did not own and over which neither it nor the township had rights of way, a main sewer planned to serve, not merely the subdivision, but a large area owned by others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The exceptant sought to terminate the trust annuities, arguing that there was a diminution of income from the trust and loss of purchasing power of that income. The reduction in income was the result of the trustees' interpretation of the investment powers in the will. On the exceptions to the adjudication, the court held that the exceptant should be afforded an opportunity to obtain an interpretation of the trustees' investment powers before the court acted upon the exceptions. Thus, the court dismissed the exceptions and recommitted the case to the auditing judge. In a supplemental adjudication, the auditing judge was unwilling to deviate from the testator's explicit investment directions. The auditing judge held that under the Fiduciaries Investment Act of May 26, 1949, P. L. 1828, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 20, &sect; 821, the trustees were allowed to invest in any investment authorized under the Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The apartments burned, and under the applicable limitations period, the apartments had three years to rebuild. However, the city then passed an ordinance changing the zoning of that particular area. Under the new zoning, the apartments could be much larger. However, a restraining order had been sought to restrict the construction of the larger building based on the constitutionality of the ordinance. The apartments sought a declaratory judgment tolling the time to rebuild until that litigation was concluded so that the apartments could rebuild on the larger scale, if possible. The court determined that the apartments were not entitled to the declaratory judgment, primarily because they could show no prejudice because they could always rebuild the apartments as they existed before the fire.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that discrimination was effected by the ordinance in conflict with the laws of the State and the provisions of State and Federal Constitutions by discriminating between the method of sales of candy. If the candy was not sold by a vending machine, the tax was inapplicable. The tax was discriminatory and lacking in uniformity and was, therefore, in violation of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 9 and 10, and Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1, as well as U.S. Const. amend. XIV.

The court dismissed the case because there never was any hearing before the justice of the peace. The record returned to quarter sessions court showed that when defendant was arrested by warrant he was forthwith brought before the justice of the peace and that he waived a hearing. Thus the court had no jurisdiction to consider the matter on its merits, because neither the township's code nor the ordinance gave defendant any right to waive a hearing. As the statute conferred no right, it died not exist. In addition, the legislature made no provisions conferring any right on defendant to waive a hearing. Therefore, the right did not exist. Finally, there was no summary conviction because there was no hearing before a magistrate, as defendant waived a hearing and the Commonwealth did not insist upon a hearing before a justice of the peace.</SPAN></P>

The sewer line would connect the township authority's sewer with a treatment plant located in another county. The landowner filed exceptions to the petition and argued that the township authority could not exercise its power to condemn outside of the boundaries of the town that created it. The court disagreed. The court held that the Municipality Authorities Act of 1945, by Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 2900z-5(B), 2900z-12, conferred upon authorities the power of eminent domain both within and without the geographic limitations of the municipalities creating them, and that these provisions were self-sustaining. A new provision in the Act, Pa. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainants, individuals and a corporation, filed a complaint against respondent Hanover Township (Pennsylvania) to invalidate a resolution that was passed on March 12, 1952, and was related to the storage of crude oil or its volatile products. Complaints claimed that the ordinance was inconsistent with State regulations, was arbitrary and unreasonable, was an unlawful interference with the use of property, and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation sought to build a facility that used storage tanks that were larger than 75,000 gallons, which was forbidden by the ordinance. The court rejected complainants' claim that the ordinance was inconsistent with State regulations because the State regulations did not specifically permit the use of tanks of unlimited capacity, the State's minimum restrictions did not preclude more stringent local restrictions, and the State regulations specifically provided that a local permit could be required. However, the ordinance failed because it was unconstitutional, as there was no rational relationship between the limit on tank size and the goal of safety. There was no evidence that large tanks were more dangerous than small tanks. Complainants could store many times the amount proposed to be stored in either the colossal tanks proposed, or in tanks of an approved size, and still comply with both the resolution and State regulations. Whether or not, therefore, storage was limited to 75,000 gallon tanks or to larger ones was immaterial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared that the resolution had no reasonable relation to the health, safety, or general welfare of the residents of the Township and was therefore void and of no effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving too fast for conditions. The prosecuting officer testified that defendant was going 50 miles per hour, although there was no certificate attesting to the speedometer's accuracy. Defendant testified that he drove 35 miles per hour upon entering the borough limits. The court found defendant not guilty, holding that what constituted driving too fast for conditions was a question of fact and that according to &sect; 1002(d) of the (Pennsylvania) Vehicle Code of May 1, 1929, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 75, &sect; 501, when the rate of speed was based on official speed limit signs, such time had to be taken by at least two officers, and defendant's conviction could not be had upon the unsupported evidence of one officer. While signs warned defendant that there was a speed trap in the borough, the statute regarding proof of rate of speed were ignored by arresting defendant on a charge which possibly had no relation to speeding. Because the officer followed defendant in a portion of the borough which could scarcely be called a business or residence district, the factual and legal situation presented was squarely within the class of cases &sect; 1002(d) sought to cover.</SPAN></P>

The statute said that killing deer violated the law except as otherwise provided. Sustaining the appeal, the court said that it was impossible for defendant to dress the carcasses because he did not know how to do it. It was physically impossible for him to transport them. He did everything he could to comply with the law. He could not be held liable for not doing so under those conditions because the statute's requirements were unjust and unreasonable under the facts of the case. The statute was not sufficiently clear and precise. Failing to include specifically the crimes charged left the statute without a penalty for the crimes.

They also admitted that they were without authority to exonerate such persons. Enjoining defendants from enforcing the collection of taxes under the Ordinance, the court held that it was shown no constitutional mandate that permitted exemptions to be made for all of the persons, firms, organizations, societies, and activities that the borough had exempted.

In entering judgment for the officials, the court ruled that such a construction of the Act was prohibited by Pa. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff gas station owners filed suit, seeking to enjoin defendant corporation from selling gasoline at its manufacturing plant to employees at wholesale prices. The gas station owners argued that such sales by the corporation violated the Act of August 11, 1941, P.L. 898, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 941 et seq. In turn, the corporation argued that the statute was unconstitutional. After a bench trial in the case, the court rendered its decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among other things, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 941 et seq. prohibited corporations engaged in business in the Commonwealth from selling to its employees any product that was neither of its own production nor handled in its regular course of trade or business. Though the gas that the corporation was selling fell within the parameters of the statute, it argued that the law violated both the procedural due process and equal protection provisions of the United States Constitution, as well as Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 7, which prohibited the Pennsylvania legislature from passing any local or special laws regulating labor, trade, mining or manufacturing. Because Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 941 et seq. did not affect the health, peace, safety or morals of the general public and had nothing to do with taking private property for public use, the court reviewed it to determine if it was a legitimate exercise of the State's police power. Because there was not a close relationship between the public and either party's business and because the statute was not meant to eradicate monopolies, the court found that it violated both Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 7 and U.S. Const. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district entered into arrangements with the State Public School Building Authority for the construction of a school building to be leased to the consolidated district for 38 years. The contract to lease provided for two contingencies: (1) If the estimated costs exceeded a maximum amount, the contract was null and void, and (2) If after construction had begun the total cost of the project, lest contributions of the consolidated district, should exceed the maximum amount, the Authority could issue additional bonds and complete the project, subject to the approval of the Department of Public Instruction, and annual rentals could be adjusted to conform to the new costs. The court held that there was nothing illegal or unconscionable in the clause pertaining to the rental adjustment. The court stated that the contract did not make the Authority the sole body empowered to determine what changes to the specifications should be made. The court noted that Pa. Stat.

The landowner argued that the contractor was actually a subcontractor who had failed to comply with the statutory provisions for subcontractor's liens and that the swimming pool was not a &quot;structure&quot; under the Act. The jury rendered a verdict for the contractor. The landowner moved for a new trial or a j.n.o.v. The court refused the motions. The motion for a new trial was without merit and was not pressed. The sole question on the motion for a j.n.o.v. was the validity of the Act under Pa. Const. of 1874, art. III, &sect; 7. The Mechanic's Lien Law had merely consolidated the lien laws in existence prior to 1874. Pa. Const. of 1874, art. III, &sect; 7 prohibited the enforcement of a lien in personam rather than in rem, or changes to old methods for enforcement of the liens.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Commonwealth filed its lien under the Act, the mortgagor was adjudicated a bankrupt in federal court, and a sum sufficient to satisfy the mortgagee's claim was set aside, pending a determination of lien priorities. In confirming the priority of the Commonwealth's tax lien, the court concluded that &sect; 1401 of the Fiscal Code, 1929 Pa. Laws 343, amended by 1949 Pa. Laws 745, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 1401 (Code), clearly provided that amounts due the Commonwealth under tax liens were to be allowed and paid from proceeds of judicial sales before any other claim or lien. Thus, the court rejected the argument that, because of hardships to prior lienholders, the Code meant to exempt preexisting mortgage holders. Instead, the court reasoned that, if the legislature had intended an exemption, it would have included such provision in the Act in the same manner in which exemptions appeared in other tax statutes. Next, the court found the Commonwealth's priority was constitutionally valid, even if the mortgagee's claim was for a purchase money mortgage, noting that similar lien priority statutes were found not to impermissibly impair the contractual rights of existing mortgagees.</SPAN></P>

The trailer was never actually used for living quarters, but defendant and his wife did spend at least one night there. Defendant contended that he was not guilty because the evidence did not show that the trailer was used for living purposes; also, that the ordinance was unconstitutional and void because the restriction against trailers was arbitrary and not regulatory and because the entire township was zoned as one residential district. The township defended on the grounds that the contentions were not properly raised by the appeal. On appeal, the court dismissed the appeal, holding that because the proper challenge to an ordinance was following a decision by a board of adjustment, defendant was not entitled to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance on appeal from his conviction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his summary conviction, alleging that the Act was unconstitutional because the designation of the violation as a &quot;misdemeanor&quot; presupposed an indictable offense, triable before a jury. On appeal, the court held that the Act was constitutional. The court found that calling an offense a misdemeanor did not make the charge an indictable misdemeanor so long as the legislature provided a remedy. The court found that the Act provided for a hearing before an alderman, magistrate, or justice. Defendant also argued that his failure to pay did not constitute a misdemeanor under the Act. The court agreed, holding that because there was a contractual agreement to provide a weekly wage, a prosecution under the Act could not lie.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff milk company filed a bill in equity seeking an injunction restraining defendants, city and others, from unlawfully interfering with its business. The bill alleged that the city's new ordinance was invalid, unconstitutional, and void insofar as the ordinance limited the bottles or containers to be used in the sale and delivery of milk to transparent standard glass milk bottles and prohibited the use of paper bottles or containers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the company's bill, the court found that the paper container was a safe and sanitary container from the public health standpoint. The court sought to determine whether or not the city, by ordinance, could prohibit its use. The court found that the ordinance impermissibly drew a distinction or classification between glass and paper containers, approving the glass and prohibiting use of paper, although the evidence showed that the paper container undoubtedly was a safe, sanitary, and health protecting container for packaging milk. The city could not make such distinction because the ordinance did not bear any reasonable relation to the purported object of the ordinance which was to protect public health. The court concluded that insofar as the ordinance attempted to prohibit the use of paper containers in the sale and delivery of milk it was invalid and void, and the company was entitled to relief in the form of an injunction permanently restraining defendants from enforcing the ordinance in such manner as to prohibit or interfere with the use by it of paper containers in the sale and delivery of milk in the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the distinction set up by the city's ordinance was an unreasonable, arbitrary, and discriminatory classification, and further ordered that such classification or distinction was forbidden by the fourteenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States because it deprived the company of the equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, a Pennsylvania Court of Quarter Sessions convicted defendant of assault and battery with intent to ravish. Defendant sought a new trial. He contended that the trial court erred when it permitted the Commonwealth to introduce evidence of his prior pleas of guilty and prior sentences for five sex crimes against young girls which occurred approximately eleven years earlier.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly ravished a 13-year girl who was a foster child that lived in his home. The evidence of defendant's prior conviction was offered by the Commonwealth as a part of its case in chief to show defendant's inclination, design, predilection, or disposition toward crimes of this description. Defendant objected that the prior convictions were too remote and therefore the evidence was incompetent. To bridge the span of 11 years, the Commonwealth offered to show that defendant, being under parole for the offenses, deceived and disobeyed the directions of the parole officers in order to get the girl into his home. In granting defendant's motion for a new trial, the court held that the evidence should not have been admitted. The court found that the prior offenses committed 11 years before by defendant could not be said to show an intent to ravish another young girl where defendant denied the act entirely. The former offenses were with pupils, the recent offense with a foster child. No common plan or design was observed in comparing the former offenses with the instant offense.</SPAN></P>

The township claimed that such an operation violated its zoning ordinance. The owners claimed that the ground had been used as a quarry for 25 years and was a nonconforming use and that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as affecting their land. The trial court dismissed the township's complaint. It held that the owners were properly exercising a nonconforming use. The quarry was continuously operated for 25 years with the exception of two periods of economic necessity. The temporary lack of use because of economic necessity without any intention to use the land for another but inconsistent purpose did not amount to a ceasing of the nonconforming use, and the owners were entitled to continue such use. Four other quarries were operating within 1,000 feet of the owners' property, and the land was particularly adaptable for that use. There was no attempt to show that the operation of a quarry would affect the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the community.</SPAN></P>

The court doubted the testimony of the policeman. The court noted that the motorist knew at all times that the policeman was following him. The court found that it was unlikely that the motorist would be traveling at an excessive rate of speed under the circumstances. The court found that the certificate of the examination of the speedometer in the police car was admissible into evidence. The court further noted that the Act of May 1, 1929, as amended, P.L. 905; Pa. Stat.

The parent had filed the action under the Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, &sect; 728; Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4728. The alderman imposed a fine of $ 25 and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher was accused of assaulting the parent's child. In a summary proceeding, the alderman convicted the teacher of the offense charged and sentenced the teacher to pay a fine and costs of the proceeding. The teacher filed an appeal of the alderman's decision. The issue was whether an alderman had jurisdiction to summarily convict a teacher charged with assaulting a pupil. The court noted that Pa. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6 (1874) gave defendants a right to a trial by jury. The court found that the problem was whether the teacher was, prior to the enactment of the constitutional provision, entitled to a jury trial. The court found that the offense was a misdemeanor at common law and was also expressly declared to be a misdemeanor under the Act of June 11, 1879, P.L. 142, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2 and later provisions. The court further noted that although the Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, &sect; 728; Pa. Stat. Ann. tit.18, &sect; 4728 removed the language denominating the offense as a misdemeanor, the teacher's constitutional rights were not altered. The court sustained the teacher's appeal and set aside the alderman's sentence because the teacher was entitled to a trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the teacher's appeal be sustained.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver argued that the act under which the suspension order was entered was unconstitutional as violative of the due process clause of the Constitution of the United States of America. He contended that the facts showed that he was without fault whatsoever in the accident out of which the suspension order arose and that for the Commonwealth to require him to post security in order to retain his operator's license was to deprive him of his property without due process of law. He contended that this was so even though the act provided for an appeal to the Common Pleas Court of Dauphin County, which he contended placed undue hardship upon him in being required to go to the a different city to litigate this proceeding. The court determined that the statute in question was a reasonable restriction on the right and privilege of operating an automobile upon the public highways and one that the legislature had the right to make. The court also found that the driver's due process rights were not violated by forcing him to litigate the matter in the court designated by the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the Beauty Culture Law was unconstitutional in that respect. The court noted that while the Beauty Culture Law was enacted under the Commonwealth's police power to promote the public health and safety, the public health was better protected by permitting charges for the costs of material to be made, since it tended to assure the maintenance of sanitary conditions in a beauty or barber college. The questioned provision was unconstitutional and void in that it bore no reasonable relation to the lawful end sought to be attained in the public interest for the protection of public health and safety and because it deprived the beauty college of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

On July 17, 1950, the owner filed her motion to strike off the mechanic's lien claim, upon which the court granted a rule and to which the subcontractor filed an answer. After argument, but prior to disposition of the rule by the court, the subcontractor filed a petition to amend the claim. The owner contended that the defects in the mechanic's lien claim as filed were of such fatal and substantial nature as not to permit amendment and argued the insufficiency of the notice of intention to file the lien, which notice, of course, would not be subject to amendment. The court held that the mechanic's lien claim as filed was fatally defective in lumping the materials furnished and labor performed without separating or detailing the items involved, and further that such defect, being substantial in its nature, was not subject to amendment because the period during which the lien might have been filed had expired.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 66, &sect; 1121. The Commonwealth charged defendant with furnishing the carriage of goods not as a common carrier, but as a contract carrier, which required a certificate of public convenience the same as a common carrier. Defendant appealed, contending that he did not operate as a contract carrier but leased a truck he owned to a company that used it only for hauling the company's own goods. The court affirmed, finding that proof of defendant's prior conviction for the same offense was competent and admissible to show that the arrangement between defendant and the lessee company was designed to avoid a repetition of that prior conviction by changing the form of defendant's conduct without changing the substance. The evidence established that despite the lease arrangement defendant maintained and insured the truck, supplied the gasoline therefore, and also drove the truck for the lessee company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of violating an act that provided that milk dealers were prohibited from delivering milk or milk products to the premises of a retail customer or consumer more often than once in a 48-hour period. Defendant admitted to the existence of all the facts in support of his conviction, but contended that the act was void because it was unconstitutional. The court found that while the regulation prevented a distributor from delivering milk oftener than every-other-day there was nothing to prevent the customer from receiving deliveries every day. There was therefore no violation of the order if there were every-day deliveries so long as the same dealer did not make them. The court stated that the only way that the reduction in costs of milk could be effectively brought about by such order would be to have it prohibit the receipt of deliveries by the customers more often than once every other day. Thus, the order did not have a real and substantial relation to the objective sought to be attained and was therefore, invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The partition of the real estate of the deceased resulted in the heirs contending that the distributees' attorney was not entitled to participate in the distribution of the residue of the estate. The distribution was decreed, in 21 equal shares, to the distributees. The heirs sought a audit of the determination. The heirs contended that the contracts did not apply to the proceeds of real estate of decedent and the attorney did not have charge liens against the distributive shares. The court found that the claming attorney represented 15 of the 21 distributees and sought distribution out of the 15 distributive shares, on the theory that, through their efforts and under their guidance, the probate of an alleged last will of decedent was defeated. The contracts of the attorney provided for payment of counsel fees, out of the distributees' respective distributions, on the basis of 35 percent of the amounts recovered. The contracts called for recoveries out of the estate of decedent, the personal and the real estates. Thus, the attorney was entitled to payment and, furthermore, entitled to distribution, out of the respective distributive shares of their clients.</SPAN></P>

The taxes under the amending act were a lien on the real estate of the taxpayer owner within the county, until paid. The owner filed a petition to strike the tax lien. The court stated that the Act was not retroactive in its wording and that the one question raised by the owner was whether the city had a right to file for a lien for taxes due before the effective date of the Act. The court stated that where legislation concerned procedure or an added remedy it could be applied to occurrences prior to its effective date if vested interests were not thereby destroyed or affected. The Act of 1913 granted the city the right to collected unpaid personal property taxes by an action in assumpsit and because a lien on real estate could have been obtained under that Act the amending Act did not impose any additional obligation.</SPAN></P>

Service of the complaint was made on the administratrix by mailing and by service on the Secretary of the Commonwealth.

They continued to hold that property until the wife died by the hand of the owner. He subsequently entered into a contract in writing to sell and convey the property to the purchasers.

L. 816, &sect; 5, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 20, &sect;&sect; 3441-3456. The court opined that the Act of 1941 did not operate retroactively, and therefore, did not govern the agreement of sale between the parties. The court found nothing to take it out of the general rule of construction that it was prospective only. The court stated that any attempt to take the owner's property from him by such a device would run afoul of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. Furthermore, because his estate was vested at the time of the crime, the court held that the legislature could not have taken away that property under Pa. Const. &sect; 18.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board amended regulation 5(b)3 to require licensed undertakers to hire untrained apprentices to embalm 25 bodies before the apprentices were permitted to go to undertaker school. The undertakers sued. The court declared that the regulation and &sect; 14 of the Pennsylvania Act of July 19, 1935, P. L. 1324, were nullities. Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, &sect;&sect; 478a-478r, was a health and safety police measure. Regulation 5(b)3 was an arbitrary and unreasonable regulation because undertakers were required to hire apprentices with no training in sanitation or disease prevention and were required to have them embalm bodies. The training was obviously more effective if it preceded or was concurrent with practical experience. The Board's claim that it sought to restrict the number of undertakers and to protect students from paying for training without knowing if they liked the work were impermissible purposes that had no relation to health and safety. Because the regulation transcended the police power it was invalid. Because no standards were provided to the Board, &sect; 14 of the Act of July 19, 1935, P. L. 1324, was an impermissible delegation of legislative authority under Pa. Const. art II, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Board of Undertakers, Pa., Reg. 5(b)3 was passed to limit the number of apprentices and those entering the profession as undertakers by requiring the apprentices to have experience prior to enrollment in the schools. The schools formally petitioned the Board to rescind the amendment. The Board denied the application. The schools sued to enjoin enforcement of the regulation. The court granted the injunction. In a companion case decided the same day, the court had held that Reg. 5(b)3, to the extent that it required immediate student apprenticeship, to be followed by embalming school training, constituted a violation of the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 9. The court rejected the Board's claim that even if the regulation was unconstitutional, the schools lacked standing to challenge it. The schools were directly and immediately aggrieved by the regulation because of an immediate reduction in their enrollments and the financial loss that accompanied that reduction, which gave the schools standing under the Pennsylvania Administrative Agency Law of June 4, 1945, Pa.

The owners, who challenged the ordinance, filed with the borough an application for a building permit to authorize the construction of a show room on the premises.

The court noted that in another case an ordinance was held invalid where it provided for varying building lines from block to block. In another case, an ordinance fixing set-back lines in separated blocks was held invalid. The ordinance in question regulated building on one side of the street only. If an ordinance fixing set-back lines in separated blocks was invalid, clearly this one, which intended to regulate one side of a street alone could not be sustained. A subsequently enacted ordinance did not make the one in question valid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff private trade school operator filed a bill in equity seeking to enjoin defendant individuals from collecting an annual license fee pursuant to the Act of May 2, 1945 (Pennsylvania), P. L. 401, as amended by the Act of May 9, 1949 (Pennsylvania), P. L. 1008. He also sought to compel the return of three renewal license fees that he had previously paid. The court granted a rule to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator was granted an original license to conduct the trade school. Thereafter, he paid fees and was issued three renewal licenses for the school. In 1949, however, the Pennsylvania legislature significantly increased the license fees. The operator refused to pay the fee. He filed the bill, challenging the constitutionality of the amended Act of May 2, 1945 on the ground that the license fees were excessive, that they bore no reasonable relation to the cost of enforcing the licensing law, and that it deprived him of property without due process. The evidence showed that the fees collected substantially exceeded the Pennsylvania State Board of Private Trade Schools' annual budget and that the Board planned to expand its activities and adopt more extensive, costly, and stringent regulations. In dismissing the bill, the court held that the statute required the operator to pay yearly renewal fees; the operator's original license did not confer a permanent right to operate the school. The fees were not unconstitutional. Although they exceeded the Board's current operating expenses, they were not grossly excessive or disproportionate to the expense involved in enforcing the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the bill. It ordered the operator to pay costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, several members of the religious group, appealed the judgment of a magistrate judge of Lansdale, Pennsylvania, which found defendants guilty of conducting door-to-door evangelistic work without first obtaining a license as required by Borough of Lansdale, Pa., Ordinance No. 388, as amended (1949).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Borough passed the ordinance which provided for the registration and licensing of persons who sought to solicit door-to-door. The ordinance set forth a schedule of fees but waived such fees for those engaged in the noncommercial dissemination of economic, political, cultural, or religious information. Defendants, along with about 25 others, came to the Borough and began evangelistic and missionary work from house to house without complying with the registration and licensing requirement. When confronted by police, defendants were offered the opportunity to register but they refused. An information was signed against them and they were tried and found guilty by a magistrate judge. On appeal, defendants alleged that the ordinance was void because it bore no relationship to police power and violated defendants' rights as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The court held that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the Borough's police power. The court noted that the free exercise of religion was not an absolute right to be enjoyed without the regard for the rights and privileges of others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district filed an appeal from an ordinance allowing appellee borough to annex a section of the school district's township. The borough filed a motion to quash the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borough maintained that the school district failed to obtain a rule and that the school district was not an aggrieved person entitled to an appeal. The court observed that the Borough Code of May 18, 1933, P. L. 818, &sect; 1, as amended by the Act of July 10, 1947, P. L. 1621, &sect; 23, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 12900, governed the annexation. Section 12900 provided for an appeal by any aggrieved person from the ordinance. Moreover, in the absence of any requirement in &sect; 12900 or any rule of court, the court held that a rule need not have been obtained by the school district. The court also ruled that the school district was an aggrieved person under &sect; 12900. The annexation of property within a particular school district did not automatically alter the school district. Rather, art. II, &sect; 227 of the Public School Code of March 10, 1949, P. L. 30, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 2-228, provided the process whereby the State Council of Education was to have considered the effect upon a school district following an annexation. Even though the Council had the right to rule upon the annexation, the school district was also a person aggrieved that could have appealed from the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The corporation also asserted that had attempted to agree with the owner as to damages for the right-of-way easement so described, but the owner refused to agree and refused the bond that the corporation had tendered to it. The court held that the Federal Natural Gas Act of June 21, 1938, ch. 556, 52 Stat. 821, as amended, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 717 et seq., gave the corporation a prima facie right to condemn, and that the purposes set forth in the resolution of the corporation's board of directors, being in the very words of the act of Congress, set forth a public purpose. The court also ruled that the corporation was entitled to exercise the right of eminent domain because, contrary to the owner's assertions, there was a procedure in Pennsylvania available to the parties. The Act of May 29, 1885, P. L. 29 (Pennsylvania), adequately set forth the procedure and protected the owner from an unjust taking without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

The injuries resulted from an automobile accident involving the decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator argued that that the action was barred by the Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 236 (Pennsylvania) and the Fiduciaries Act of 1917 (Pennsylvania) as amended by the Act of July 2, 1937, P. L. 2755 (Pennsylvania). A writ of summons was issued in this suit, which was not served on the administrator and the sheriff made no return of service. The decedent died on the day of the accident. The summons was twice reissued, but in both instances the administrator was not served and the sheriff made no return of service. The summons was reissued and was served on the administrator. Accordingly, the original summons was issued within two years of the date of accident. The last summons actually served was reissued more than two years from the date of the accident. The court found that it was not necessary to have a sheriff's return of failure to serve the writ to warrant its reissuance. Plaintiffs unquestionably could have sued the decedent within the two years after the accident if the latter had not died. The death of a person did not stop the running of the statutes of limitations. The two years' period did not expire in less than one year after the decedent's death.</SPAN></P>

Invalidating the provision, the court concluded that it violated the Constitution of Pennsylvania. Pa. Const. art.

The Act of 1874 imposed a fine for violating the constitutional provision. The right to contract was limited and could not violate the Constitution of Pennsylvania or statutes.

Appellee Commonwealth urged that the title to the bonds, inscribed as &quot;husband or wife&quot;, was not held as tenants by the entirety because either party had the right to sell the bonds and because it is not possible to create an estate by entireties in United States savings bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent and his partner conducted a coal stripping operation. The partner was the business manager and, because of his proficiency, also aided the decedent and his widow in transacting their individual financial affairs. The partner purchased the bonds with funds supplied in part from the widow and in part from the decedent. All of the bonds were inscribed with the names of the husband or wife. The decedent had a safe deposit box and the persons authorized to have access to the box were the decedent and his partner. Only the bonds were placed in this box. The business partnership maintained a different box. The Commonwealth insisted that an estate by entireties in the bonds did not exist because there had been no delivery to the wife. The court held that neither the use of the disjunctive &quot;or&quot; in the registered title of the bonds, nor the fact that either could cash the bonds, prevented an estate by entireties from arising. The court also concluded that the fact the law of Pennsylvania presumed that widow succeeded to the unlimited title as tenant by the entireties, not as joint tenant, was inconsistent with no federal statute or regulation pertaining to the bonds.</SPAN></P>

The dealers argued that they were merely engaged in the distribution of certain daily newspapers directly to subscribers, who received the papers at their homes from carrier boys employed by the dealers; they merely rendered a service by distributing the papers to the individual subscribers and were therefore not subject to the tax under the terms of the ordinance itself; and that the attempt to place a tax upon the distribution of newspapers of general circulation was void and unconstitutional as an infringement of the constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press. Defendants prayed for dismissal of the bill, contending that the dealers were vendors or dealers in goods, wares, or merchandise. Dismissing, the court held that there was no question that newspapers were classified as goods, wares, and merchandise.

The court found that the property owners had the burden to establish that the proposed use of the property would reduce the comfort and privacy of their property as single-family dwellings and would substantially reduce the market value of the property and that they had failed to meet that burden. The court found that the contention of the property owners, if upheld, would have limited the religious freedom of the order to act upon and put into practice its religious beliefs and to follow the methods that the order had chosen and that it would have been an interference with and violation of the freedom of religion, as guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. The court found that the term &quot;accessory uses,&quot; as found in Pittsburgh, Pa., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 9-A, did not apply to churches because any other reading would have rendered the ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs contended that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 4, &sect; 201 et seq. violated Pa. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 9 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV in that it amounted to an unjustified interference with private business and property; specifically, plaintiffs alleged that the area of ticket sales was &quot;affected with a public interest&quot; such that regulation thereof was prohibited. The court held that the maximum premium fixed by the statute was not unreasonable, confiscatory, or discriminatory. The court rejected plaintiffs' argument that the &quot;affected with a public interest&quot; test applied; that test applied to cases involving public utilities.

Stat. Ann. tit. 31, &sect; 800.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the proprietor of a hotel that operated a dining room. Defendant did not have a license to manufacture or sell oleomargarine, and she did not have signs in the premises that indicated that oleomargarine was used in food preparation in the dining room. A food inspector instituted proceedings before the alderman after finding that defendant was using oleomargarine in food preparation. The alderman found defendant guilty of violating the Oleomargarine Law of 1947. On appeal, the court held that the proceedings before the alderman were a complete nullity and of no legal consequence because aldermen and justices of the peace did not have criminal jurisdiction under the Oleomargarine Law. The court further held that the Oleomargarine Law was unconstitutional and void under Pa. Const. art. 3, &sect;&sect; 1, 3 insofar as it attempted to regulate the manner in which oleomargarine, colored or uncolored, could be used. The court reasoned that the title of the Oleomargarine Law indicated only that its purposes were to prohibit the manufacture and sale of colored oleomargarine and to regulate the manufacture and sale of uncolored oleomargarine.</SPAN></P>

In refusing the petition, the court found that it was not essential that defendant be an officer of a corporation to commit the crime charged so that the six-year limitation period did not apply. In order for the six-year limitation period to apply, the fact that defendant was an officer had to be an essential element of the crime charged.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs in two separate actions filed bills of complaint to quiet title to real estate pursuant to the Act of May 23, 1949, 1949 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole question involved was the jurisdiction of the court. If the Act impaired the obligation of contract under the U.S. or Pennsylvania Constitutions, the court had no jurisdiction in the matter. The Act attempted to cover those cases where a mortgage, ground rent, etc., was charged against the land and the period of 50 years had elapsed after the principal had become due. Where no due date was recited in the instrument, then 50 years after the date of creation, there was to be a conclusive presumption of payment. The court held that the Act was unconstitutional. The Act was an unconstitutional deprivation of property and an impairment of the liens and obligation of contracts. The Act could not be justified because it applied whether or not payment of principal was due and whether or not current payments were being made. The Act clearly impaired the obligation of the contract by requiring a court proceeding in order to preserve the remedies stipulated in the contract. The Act impaired and lessened the value of the ground rent contract by requiring costly court proceedings in order to continue its validity and extinguishing the right if such proceedings were not instituted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant charged with reckless driving in violation of &sect; 1001 of the Vehicle Code, which defined the charge as a statutory offense prescribing summary conviction. As provided by the Code, defendant waived the charge of reckless driving and gave his bond for a later appearance in court. Subsequently, he filed a demand for a jury trial, arguing that the allowance of summary convictions under the Code violated his constitutional rights. The court reviewed the record and noted that defendant, having waived the charge, was presumed to know that he had not been charged with either a misdemeanor or a felony. The court also noted that summary convictions were recognized at common law or for offenses unknown at common law, and thus, did not violate the constitutional provisions of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, which provided that trial by jury shall remain inviolate. Finally, the court held that Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 14, which established the right of persons convicted in a court not of record of a summary conviction to appeal in accordance with the manner &quot;as may be prescribed by law upon allowance&quot; did not guarantee to one who appealed from a summary conviction the right to be tried by a jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought a decrease in the number of councilmen serving in the Borough of Dickson City, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania. The proceedings were initiated under &sect; 15 of the Act of July 10, 1947, P. L. 1621, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 12707.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The argument against the legislation's constitutionality was that there was an invalid delegation of legislative power. The court agreed and dismissed the petition. Section 15 of the Act of July 10, 1947, P.L. 1621, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 12707, was invalid because the legislature sought to delegate to the judiciary the ability to issue a decree permitting a decrease in the number of councilmen. The court held that the conclusion was inescapable that this delegation of authority was beyond the scope of a court's jurisdiction. Only the legislature had the power to make, alter, or repeal the law. There were no rules or standard by which the judiciary would be guided, and the legislation left the matter in the discretion of the judiciary. The law was invalid permitting the judiciary to fix the number of councilmen without having any checks or controls.</SPAN></P>

Under the Act of 1931, the board was to examine and to revise the assessments. The court noted that the principal of uniformity applied to the considerations of the assessor, of the board, and of the court in determining the valuation of the property. The presentation of the record showing the appraisement filed and revised by the board established a prima facie case. The fairness of the revised valuation was presumed, and the burden of proving the incorrectness of the conclusion reached devolved upon the owners. The court fixed the assessment, applying to the actual value of the property a ratio of assessment to actual value that was generally applicable in the district.</SPAN></P>

Because the school was operated under a different name than its corporate name, the Superintendent alleged that the school was not a proper party. The court held that the school could sue either under its fictitious name or its corporate name. The court rejected the Superintendent's allegation that the school had an adequate remedy at law. The court held that the action was proper to enforce a direct invasion of the school's property rights. The court held that the fact that the school's attorney had filed similar actions for other clients did not preclude the school from filing the same action in its own behalf.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents argued that the income generated by the Ordinance was grossly disproportionate to the amount needed to administer the Ordinance and that, as a result, the Ordinance was a revenue measure and not a licensing act and was unconstitutional as an invalid exercise of the police power. The court disagreed, opining that the extraordinary Borough services commanded by trailer camps amply justified the size of the license fee imposed by the Ordinance. The court concluded that the revenue derived from the license was not disproportionate to the services rendered. The court opined, however, that the Ordinance was unconstitutional with respect to one resident, who resided in the house trailer, which was located on his own real property, as his primary residence. The court opined that the Ordinance violated Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV by overreaching itself by including things not subject to licensure and by depriving one class of citizens of the equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trustee filed a bill in equity averring that defendant school district's tax resolution was unconstitutional and requesting that the court enjoin its enforcement. School District of Union Township, Pa., Resolution No. 2 (June 12, 1948) levied a tax on all stone quarried, severed, and removed from the ground in the township. Defendant company deducted the tax from payments to the trustee under a quarrying agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that it was illegal to impose the tax for the removal of stone from the ground. Pennsylvania Act of June 25, 1947, P. L.1145 authorized school districts to levy taxes on persons, privileges, and personal property within the school district. However, it did not authorize defendant school district to impose taxes on the owners of intangible personal property that was located outside the school district. The situs of intangible personal property was a person or company's legal residence or its principal place of business. Situs of the trustee's rights in the contract was outside the township's territorial limits. The wording of the resolution made it clear that the tax was not a privilege or excise tax. The agreement between the trustee and defendant company was a sale. The company, the lessee, agreed to pay royalties in a set amount annually, without regard to contingencies, to the trustee, the lessor. This was a sale of the coal in place. The court issued an injunction restraining defendants from enforcing the resolution and directing that all taxes paid be remitted to the trustee. The court dismissed defendant school district's exceptions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed defendant school district's exceptions. The court ordered that an injunction should issue enjoining defendants from enforcing the resolution and collecting any taxes. The court also enjoined defendant company from deducting the taxes from any payments to the trustee. Defendants were directed to remit any past taxes paid to the trustee.</SPAN></P>

The court read each of the books in their entirety and concluded that they were obvious efforts to show life as it is. The court held that &sect; 524 did not constitutionally apply because the works were not sexually impure and pornographic, nor was there a proper exercise of the police power because there was no reasonable and demonstrable cause to believe that a crime or misdemeanor had been committed or was about to be committed as the perceptible result of the publication and distribution of the writings in question. The causal connection between the books and the criminal behavior did not appear beyond a reasonable doubt.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator filed a habeas corpus petition seeking his release from a penitentiary.

Laws 862, &sect; 1, to credit for time served on parole before a parole violation. Also at issue was whether the Act of August 6, 1941, Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator was sentenced to the penitentiary for a crime. Five years after he started serving his sentence, he was paroled by the Board. About five years after that, he pleaded guilty to a second offense. He was recommitted to the penitentiary for the parole violation for a maximum of five years. His habeas corpus petition argued that the 1941 Act was unconstitutional and that he was being illegally imprisoned because 10 years had elapsed from the date that he started serving the sentence for the first offense. His petition essentially argued that in determining when that sentence expired, credit should have been given for the period that he was out on parole and behaving well. The court dismissed his petition, remanded him to the penitentiary, and allowed him an exception. The supreme court had stated that &sect; 21 of the 1941 Act was unconstitutional insofar as it gave the Board authority to extend a parole period past the maximum term imposed by a court. However, relator was being detained under &sect; 10 of the Probation Act of June 19, 1911, Pa. Laws 1055, which had been interpreted to mean that credit could not be given for time spent on parole before a committing a parole violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the judgment of a justice of the peace (Pennsylvania), finding them guilty of violating Norristown, Pa., Ordinance No. 801(1). The ordinance prohibited the parking of commercial vehicles on the streets of a designated district between certain hours of the night. A single judge of the court found defendants guilty. Defendants filed exceptions to the finding, which were argued before the court en banc.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants admittedly violated the parking ordinance. In defense of the charge, they contended that the ordinance was an attempt to regulate parking of commercial vehicles in the borough and that, as such, it violated the Motor Vehicle Code of May 1, 1929, Pennsylvania P.L. 905. That statute set forth the restrictions and regulations that local governments could impose on parking and under what conditions they could be imposed. The Commonwealth contended that the ordinance was passed to protect against fire damage, not parking. The court en banc held that if the purpose of the regulation was to regulate parking, it was unenforceable against defendants under P.L. 905, because the borough had not erected signs to give notice of the ordinance, as required by P.L. 905. The court rejected the Commonwealth's contention that the ordinance was passed under the general police power of the borough, to prevent fire damage and to provide easier access for emergency vehicles. The court held that it was an ordinance to restrict parking on the highways, passed under the guise of a fire regulation. As such, it exceeded the borough's powers to regulate parking.</SPAN></P>

The court issued a preliminary injunction and the school district filed preliminary objections to the bill in equity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district claimed that the taxpayer had an adequate remedy at law and that the court of equity lacked jurisdiction over the case. The court overruled the school district's preliminary objections. Section 3 of the Act of 1947, P.L. 1145 (Pennsylvania), granted taxpayers a limited right to appeal a resolution levying a tax. The taxpayer did not meet either of the two grounds on which the appeal was available, but claimed that it was aggrieved by the imposition of the tax and was without any right of appeal. As there was no proof that the taxpayer had a full, adequate remedy at law, the taxpayer's action was a valid appeal of the tax. The court determined that it had equity jurisdiction over the case. The taxpayer claimed that the school district lacked the power to levy any tax; therefore, there was equity jurisdiction to restrain the collection of taxes. Nothing in &sect; 3 took away the court's equity jurisdiction to restrain the collection of a tax where the taxing entity lacked power to levy the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's widow was named as the life beneficiary of a spendthrift trust created by the testator. He named his daughter as a life beneficiary of that same trust and her issue acquired a remainder interest thereto. After the decedent's daughter died his widow sought to cancel the interest the decedent's granddaughter held in the trust as a remainderman pursuant to 1945 Pa. Laws 1337, &sect; 1, which was enacted after the trust was created. The court found for exceptants and held that the life beneficiary lacked power to terminate a spendthrift trust without the creator's consent. Testators had a right to protect their heirs from a presumed incapacity to manage their inheritance and only an express enactment could abrogate that right. A clumsily drawn statute, Pa. Laws 1337, &sect; 1 was not an express, definite, and positive abrogation of the rights of testators. The court noted that Pa Laws 1337, &sect; 1 was constitutional as the power of disposition was a privilege subject to legislative control until such time as that privilege was exercised, upon which time it became a right. Unwarranted invasion of a spendthrift trust violated due process under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did keep for sale and gratuitous distribution nostrums for the purpose of preventing conception. However, he argued that the indictment did not charge defendant with the commission of any crime under the laws of the Commonwealth. The court on appeal concluded that the trial court should have granted the motion of defendant to quash the indictment. Accordingly, the court was compelled to grant defendant's motion to arrest the judgment for the reason that the indictment did not charge an indictable offense under the law of the Commonwealth. The Act of March 16, 1870, P. L. 39 (Pennsylvania), prohibited the advertisement and the sale, and keeping for sale, of any secret drug or nostrum purporting to be for the use of females, and also the publishing of an account or description of any drug, medicine, instrument, or apparatus for the purpose of preventing conception. This Act, along with the related Act of May 12, 1897, P. L. 63, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 778, were repealed and replaced by the Penal Code of June 24, 1939, P.

The motion was before the trial court for decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by indictment with a violation of the Act. He filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, which the trial court treated as a motion to quash. Defendant insisted that the indictment failed to provide adequate information to prepare his defense. The trial court noted that an indictment had to meet two tests: first, it had to furnish sufficient information and particulars to enable defendant properly to prepare his defense; second, it had to be sufficiently precise to protect him from a second prosecution. The trial court concluded that the indictment satisfied these requirements and was constitutional. The indictment alleged that a landlord's distraint had been made on behalf of the individual prosecutrix, identified the landlord, clearly showed that the landlord was a creditor, and that rent was due the landlord. The Act made it an offense to remove property with intent to defraud any creditor, and it was indictable if there was an intention to defraud a single creditor. Thus, the trial court concluded that the allegations in the indictment supported a charge under the Act.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled for defendants, holding that the ordinance was adopted in accordance with the power given the city council by 1838 Pa. Laws 626, &sect; 3 and was constitutional. Where signs or other devices projected over public property or encroached upon the air space over it, the city could regulate them without regard to the public safety, welfare, and morals.

L. 1145 (Pennsylvania). Appellants contended that the Resolution and tax thereunder violated Pa. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">From an examination of the title to the Resolution, it appeared to the court that it was a general law, uniform in its nature upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the School District of the Borough of State College, Pennsylvania. For that reason it was held by the court that the same was not repugnant to Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1. The court was also unable to conclude that the tax provided for by the Resolution was unreasonable, as the board of school directors, who were the representatives of the people, in the exercise of their discretion deemed it advisable to pay the particular obligations from taxes to be raised during the current year. That discretionary power was vested in the members of the school board and the court did not feel that it lied within the province of the court to disturb the judgment of the legally elected representatives in the exercise of their honest judgment. Finally, as the purpose of the indebtedness was legal, the action of the School District in imposing a tax to liquidate the indebtedness was a proper one.</SPAN></P>

Less than four years after the taxes were paid, it petitioned the Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue for a partial refund, asserting that the amount of taxes due had been erroneously computed. The petition was refused. The corporation then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus seeking to compel respondent Pennsylvania State Treasurer to refund the taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the corporation filed its 1936 franchise tax report it erroneously included gross receipts from an Illinois office. It discovered the error after it filed its 1938 income tax report. The corporation appealed the Board's proposed income tax settlement; the parties thereafter entered into a stipulated agreement that excluded the Illinois gross receipts from taxation. The corporation then petitioned for a partial refund of the franchise taxes that it had paid. The Board refused the petition on the ground that it had not been filed within two years as required by &sect; 503(a) of the Pennsylvania Fiscal Code of April 9, 1929, P. L. 343, as amended by the Act of June 7, 1935, P. L. 283, and the Act of May 7, 1943, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 503. The court agreed and dismissed the mandamus petition. The stipulated agreement was relevant because the franchise and income tax statutes both used the same gross receipts fraction in determining tax liability. The time for filing the petition was not extended by the entry of the stipulated agreement because the agreement did not constitute a final judgment of the court; it was not a final judgment because the court had never acted upon it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the joint school district was formed for the purpose of operating a joint four-year high school, the teacher had already been employed for more than a decade by the borough school district as a teacher of physical education. At the time of the consolidation, the teacher was the only qualified male instructor of physical education employed by either the borough or the township districts. The teacher was not employed by the joint district and was given no written notice before his contract was terminated. He was replaced by an instructor who was not certified to teach physical education, although his official rating in the county superintendent's files was higher than the teacher's. The court found that where two school districts consolidated to form a joint high school, the contracts of the professional employees of each separate district were not terminated by operation of law and that the professional employes rendered unnecessary by reason of such a consolidation had to be suspended by the joint school district according to the terms of &sect; 2(b) of the Act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district adopted a resolution that levied and imposed a tax for general school purposes, upon the privilege, transaction or occupation of mining by all persons, co-partnerships, associations, and corporations. It claimed its authority for the resolution from the Act of June 25, 1947, P. L. 1145. The taxpayers appealed. The court dismissed the appeal. The court determined that excise taxes did not conflict with property taxes and that the tax levied did not relate to a subject upon which a State tax or license fee had already been imposed, either through the capital stock tax, the corporate net income tax, or the foreign corporation franchise tax. Local taxes imposed under the authority of the legislature were not to be treated as Pennsylvania State taxes. With the school district tax, the impact was on a totally different basis, being on the privilege, transaction, or occupation of mining or severing coal, and the tax was not measured by the value of the property of the foreign corporation within the State. It was not a tax limited to foreign corporate associations but was imposed on all persons, co-partnerships, associations, and corporations.</SPAN></P>

After the court overruled the city's preliminary objections, the parties sought disposition of the rules for preliminary injunction and the matter was brought for the final hearing on bill and answer. The court dismissed the taxpayers' bills and entered a decree nisi. The taxpayers had properly brought the action because limitations in &sect; 3 of the Stonier-Brunner Act did not affect the fact that the classic attack against an illegal tax was by bill in equity. However, the Ordinance was valid because the Pennsylvania Newspaper Advertising Act did not apply to the Ordinance, and proper notice had been given under the Pennsylvania Stonier-Brunner Act. Further, the city was acting within its authority to collect taxes, and the withholding requirement was not an unconstitutional deprivation of the employers' constitutional rights to property.</SPAN></P>

The surety company denied any liability on the bond, alleging that as to the Maryland producers, the milk produced by and purchased from them was not subject to the jurisdiction of the Law or the Commission, and that as to both the Maryland and the Pennsylvania producers, the Commission's failure to require the corporation to maintain within the Commonwealth the records required by &sect; 701 of the Law constituted a breach of the condition of the bond. The court concluded that judgment had to be entered against the surety company and in favor of the Commission in the amount due to the Pennsylvania producers. However, the Court further concluded that it was not the intent of the legislature that the law embrace out-of-state producers. The producers mentioned throughout the Law, and for whose benefit the price-fixing and bonding provisions of the Law were included, were Pennsylvania producers.

The court noted that the burden was on the corporation to show that the classification was unreasonable or improper. The court stated that under the exclusions from taxation under the Act, while the extended to foreign surety companies, did not apply to domestic surety companies.

The court discharged the rule, holding that the tax lien was not invalid merely because it had listed the wrong person as owing the tax and that because it had been filed on time, it was valid. The court held further that because the common pleas court had the power, pursuant to the Act of April 20, 1927, P.

Although the legislature had attempted to amend the statute by providing that the statute would be inapplicable for 18 months to veterans' clubs, the governor vetoed the amendment.

Applying the presumption that the legislature did not pass an unconstitutional statute, the court concluded that &sect; 542 of Pennsylvania's School Code, 1911 P.L. 309, did not unlawfully discriminate between married and unmarried men and that the legislature had sovereign power to place upon the former a duty to pay his wife's tax because such duty flowed from the marriage relationship. The court reasoned that the family relationship between a husband and wife justified the creation of the separate classes of married men and single men. The court further reasoned that, under the doctrine of necessaries, a husband had an obligation to pay for liabilities of his wife and that such obligation extended to the payment of taxes as well as to payments arising on a contractual basis. Finding that the husband failed to carry his burden to show that a conflict existed, the court held that &sect; 542 did not offend Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

Despite the order, the landlord immediately issued an execution on the judgment that had been entered under the lease. The landlord argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court upheld the ordinance, finding that the ordinance was valid and that it properly established the Commission under Philadelphia, Pa., Rent Control Ordinance &sect;&sect; 4, 6, and 9 (1947). Additionally, the court held that the Pennsylvania legislature properly delegated the exercise of the police power as to rent control to the city of Philadelphia under Pa. Const. of 1874 art. XV, &sect; 1 and under the Philadelphia City Charter Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 3251 (1919). The court also noted that the ordinance was necessary to alleviate the housing shortage emergency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff employee's action to recover money deducted by defendant employer from the employee's gross wages, the employee filed a demurrer to the employer's answer that it was deducted pursuant to a written notice and demand of a tax collector of the School District of the Borough of Columbia, Pennsylvania, under the Act of May 18, 1945, P. L. 687 (Pennsylvania), and the Local Tax Collection Law of May 25, 1945, P. L. 1050 (Pennsylvania).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer received a written notice and demand from the tax collector stating that the employee and his wife owed the per capita tax for one year, with a penalty. The sum was deducted from the employee's wages and paid to the tax collector under the provisions of the Act of May 18, 1945, P. L. 687 (Pennsylvania), and the Local Tax Collection Law of May 25, 1945, P. L. 1050 (Pennsylvania). The employee filed an action to recover the money, and the employer answered. The employee filed a demurrer, which the court overruled. The court held that the two statutes did not violate Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1 because diversity in the methods of tax assessment and collection was proper. Absolute equality in taxes was unattainable, so as long as collection methods were provided by general laws and resulted in practically uniform collection they were not to be condemned for minor inequalities. The court held that the assessment of the per capita tax for school purposes did not fall within the power of eminent domain, for the latter acted only by a direct taking of property for a public use. Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 was a limitation not on the taxing power but on the right of eminent domain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township brought an action of assumpsit, pursuant to the Pennsylvania Local Tax Collection Law of May 25, 1945, P.L. 1050, &sect; 21(b), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5511.21(b), against the company to recover township road taxes assessed against the company as the owner of certain seated lands during the tax years at issue. The company filed preliminary objections to the complaint, which challenged the provisions of &sect; 5511.21(b) as being violative of Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 3. The court overruled the objections and allowed the company 20 days to file an answer. The title of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5511.21(b) was sufficient, as the subject matter of the Act was expressly stated in the title to have been the &quot;collection of taxes.&quot; The court held that all the Pennsylvania Constitution required was that the title to an act should put persons of a reasonably inquiring state of mind on notice of the general subject matter of the act. The incidental provisions of the statute need not have been enumerated or indexed in the title if they were germane to the legislation as a whole. Nothing could be more germane to a tax collection act than a provision establishing the method of such collection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city ordinance prohibited the storage of abandoned or junked automobiles on public or private property. Defendants were conducting a used car and parts business on their property, where they obtained used cars, dismantled them, and stored the removed parts for future sales. Pieces of the bodies or chassis that could not be used remained in various stages of disassembly, and at periodic intervals were hauled away. Plaintiff filed an action against defendants to restrain them from violating the ordinance. defendants field objections to the suit, arguing that the law did not apply to a used car parts business and that it was unconstitutional as an arbitrary confiscation of private property. The court dismissed the exceptions, holding that the ordinance was not directed at any particular type of business, but at the accumulation of garbage and rubbish, storage of junked cars, and carrying on an offensive business. Three types of offenses were prohibited, and one of them is involved in the case at bar. The inquiry was simply whether there had been a storage of abandoned or junked automobiles, and under the evidence, there was such storage and violation.</SPAN></P>
