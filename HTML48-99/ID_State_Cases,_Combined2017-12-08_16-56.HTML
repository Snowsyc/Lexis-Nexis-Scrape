</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen filed a complaint, seeking an injunction against a school district and two county governments. The citizen claimed that the school district that was formed between the two counties was based on a law that was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the injunction and dismissed the lawsuit. Subsequent to the denial of the injunction, a bond election was held and a proposed bond issue was rejected by the voters of the district. Thereafter, by proceedings subsequent to this appeal, the school district was divided and two new districts were created out of its territory. It did not appear that the legality of the new districts was dependent on that of the old. On appeal, the court held that the citizen's appeal had become moot and there was no need to determine the constitutionality of the law upon which the school district was to be formed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pipeline company sought to build a pipeline for the purpose of transporting petroleum. The pipeline company filed a motion seeking possession of the right of way under Idaho Code &sect; 7-717. The trial court affixed compensation based on the owner's affidavit as to value and damages. The owners contended that &sect; 7-717 was unconstitutional and void as it violated Idaho Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 13,14. The court found that the provisions in &sect; 7-717 that the pipeline company may file an affidavit appraising damages and that the court upon such affidavit could enter an order that upon the payment of double such amount, the pipeline company could take possession, did not proved the owner's with due process of law. The court further determined that the notice provision in &sect; 7-717 was also defective in that it did not provide for either actual service or constructive service of notice of motion for possession. The court determined that because it would have been inequitable to force the pipeline company to dig up its pipeline and surrender possession of the right of way the pipeline company was permitted to retain possession pending a final determination as to just compensation to the owners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, dental mechanics or technicians, sought review of a judgment of the trial court (Idaho), which upheld the constitutionality of 1953 Idaho Sess.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to and after the effective date of 1953 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 105, &sect; 1, appellants performed mechanical work for wearers of artificial dentures, including relining and repairing broken denture plates. Appellants performed such services in their dental laboratories, and neither they nor any of their craftsmen performed any work whatever in the oral cavity of any person. The court held that the requirement that a person performing services such as those performed by appellants be trained and licensed as a dentist was not reasonably necessary for the protection of the public. In addition, pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Idaho Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 13, the legislature could not do away with the vested rights of appellants and others similarly situated by prohibiting them from following an occupation that had been legislatively recognized as an independent calling for 34 years. Accordingly, the court held that so far as 1953 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 105, &sect; 1 affected or was intended to affect the independent occupation of dental mechanic or technician in the performance of mechanical work upon inert matter in a dental laboratory, it was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, state tax collector, sought to collect on an alleged tax deficiency of plaintiff, a life insurance corporation. Case centered around interest that plaintiff received from certain United States Government bonds; defendant claimed interest income was taxable, plaintiff claimed it was not. Plaintiff brought an action in the trial court seeking to avoid payment of the alleged deficiencies; plaintiff prevailed in the trial court, resulting in an appeal to the state supreme court. That court reversed, rejecting plaintiff's argument that prior version of statute, which exempted interest from federal bonds, still controlled due to statutory compiler's erroneous exclusion of that exemption during statutory codification process, inasmuch as legislature acted after compiler's efforts, and thus ratified the change; and further turned aside plaintiff's contention that states lack the authority to enact such taxes of federal bond interest, citing significant precedent to the contrary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed; plaintiff owed tax deficiency, as state legislature deliberately modified state tax statute to remove previous exemption for interest income received from United States Government bonds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a city and various individuals, appealed a decree of the trial court (Idaho), which ruled that defendants were maintaining and carrying on illegal lotteries in violation of Idaho Const. art. 3, &sect; 20 and enjoined defendants from maintaining gambling places. The trial court also order the seizure and sale of the various individuals' personal property, closed their places of business, and placed liens on their real estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were operating gambling places pursuant to two statutes that purported to legalize slot machines and the operation of punchboards, chance spindles, and chance prize games. Plaintiff State brought suit to have such activities enjoined, claiming that such operations were illegal and injurious to the public morals. The trial court granted injunctive relief and imposed certain penalties. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the gambling devices by whatever name they were called were lotteries and, as such, were constitutionally prohibited. The challenged statutes purporting to legalize such gambling devises were unconstitutional attempts on the part of the legislature to legalize lotteries by simply defining lotteries by other names. Such gambling devices were lotteries, and the legislative act authorizing, or attempting to authorize their operation, in any manner was unconstitutional. The court modified the judgment so as to strike to penalty provisions, finding that such penalties would have worked a hardship on those who acted in good faith and relied on the validity of the challenged statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decree except those portions allowing the seizure and sale of the personal property, placing a lien on the real estate; and closing defendants' places in which the gambling devices were operated and maintained. The court struck such penalty provisions from the decree and affirmed the decree as modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cross-appeals were taken from a declaratory judgment of an Idaho trial court, which, at the request of plaintiff taxpayer, ruled upon the validity of the Revenue Bond Act, 1951 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 47, and defendant village's ordinances in respect thereto.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Revenue Bond Act authorized municipalities to issue bonds for the construction of water and sewer facilities. The village passed an ordinance providing for a sewage collection system and sewage treatment plant. Municipal voters approved the bond proposal. The village intended to use a portion of the revenue bond funds to purchase property outside the city upon which to construct the sewage treatment and disposal plant. The trial court upheld the validity of the statute but found Kimberly, Idaho, Ordinance No. 139 to be invalid in three respects. The court affirmed in part, holding that Idaho Const. art. 8, &sect; 3, as amended, expressly empowered the village to acquire land outside its corporate limits. The revenue from the village's existing water system could be applied under Idaho Code &sect; 50-2818 to the redemption of the bond issue. The trial court erred, however, in holding that the village could not provide parity of lien for subsequent bonds; prior bondholders' priority of lien under Idaho Code &sect; 50-2824 could be waived. The issue of whether the village could compel tenants to connect to the sewer was not ripe for decision. The disconnection charges were reasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that upheld the validity of the statute and reversed the rulings that had found portions of the ordinance to be invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were separately charged by information with the crime of lewd and lascivious acts under Idaho Code &sect; 18-6607.

In reversing, the court held that the informations charged the specific intent required by Idaho Code &sect; 18-6607 and the specific intent required as an element of assault with intent to rape, under Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 18-901, 18-907, and 18-6101. The other elements of both crimes being sufficiently alleged, the informations charged both lewd and lascivious conduct and assault with intent to commit rape. Acts leading to rape or assault with intent to rape, would be lewd and lascivious and would evince the intent described in Idaho Code &sect; 18-6607 where an offense could not be committed without necessarily committing another offense, and, thus, the latter was a necessarily included offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner answered the city's allegations with a general denial. At trial, the landowner sought to prove that it had used the property as a lumberyard before the effective date of the zoning restrictions. The city's objection to this proof as &quot;new matter&quot; was sustained. The landowner then sought leave to amend its answer, which was denied on the ground of surprise. The court stated that to state a cause of action, the city had to prove that the landowner's nonconforming use did not exist when the restrictions became effective. The allegations of the complaint, though ambiguous, had to be construed to allege that the use commenced after the effective date of the restrictions. The general denial, therefore, put in issue the question of the prior existence of the nonconforming use. As for the city's claim of surprise, in its case in chief, the city offered evidence as to when the lumberyard business commenced, as it was required to do. There was no showing to support the assertion of surprise, and the city, by its ambiguous pleading, helped to create the situation out of which the claim of surprise arose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment. It remanded the case with directions for the trial court to permit the parties to offer further evidence on the issue of whether the use complained of existed before the effective date of the zoning restrictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of a district court (Idaho), which upheld his conviction in the justice court of the crime of driving a motor vehicle upon a public highway of the state, loaded in excess of weight limitations as promulgated, posted, and prescribed by the Commissioner of Public Works under authority of Idaho Code &sect; 49-606. Defendant contended that Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 49-605, 49-606, 49-609, 49-611 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of operating a truck and trailer in excess of the posted maximum load limits that were prescribed pursuant to the powers conferred on the Commissioner of Public Works by Idaho Code &sect; 49-606. Although a legislative body could not delegate legislative power to make laws to another body, such rule did not preclude conferring the power upon the Commissioner of Public Works to prescribe or vary regulations concerning motor vehicles used on public highways within definite limits fixed by the legislative body. Limitations of size and weight were manifestly subjects within the broad range of legislative discretion and the police power of the state that were not repugnant to the commerce clause. The court rejected defendant's contention that Idaho Code &sect; 49-606 had to be construed in pari materia with other provisions of the act and declared unconstitutional if Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 49-605, 49-611 were unconstitutional. Defendant was not in a class against whom discrimination operated to question Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 49-605, 49-611, and the court concluded that such constitutional questions did not affect the constitutionality of the section under which defendant was convicted.</SPAN></P>

The commissioners appealed, arguing that plaintiffs had an adequate remedy on appeal, that the acts prohibited were purely ministerial, and thus, the prohibition did not lie. The court held that an appeal was available to plaintiffs. Thus, if the appeal was an adequate remedy, plaintiffs were not entitled to a writ of prohibition. The legislature provided for an appeal from all actions or orders of the commissioners whether they were ministerial or not. Under Idaho Code &sect; 33-519, the remedy provided by an appeal would be broad. Thus, the remedy was adequate and plaintiffs were not entitled to a writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

None of the employees were joined in the action or joined with the union in resisting the issuance of the injunction and none of the employees urging that Idaho Code &sect; 44-712 was unconstitutional. On appeal of the issuance of the injunction, the court pointed out that the union was not claiming anything as minority employees, merely as a labor union entirely disconnected from the employer and, therefore, not within the orbit of the statute in any particular. The union merely projected a contingency not in existence, and whatever might be the effect of the statute in the future on supposititious cases not in the instant record, the union, not being employees of any kind, could not challenge the statute as discriminating against minority employees.</SPAN></P>

The voucher was approved by the director of the department and was presented to defendant for payment. Defendant refused to draw a warrant on the fund for payment of the voucher.

The court issued an alternative writ of mandate requiring defendant to issue the warrant or show cause why he should not do so. Defendant filed an answer challenging the constitutionality of Idaho Code &sect; 36-125. The court denied the application for the writ of mandate and held that &sect; 36-125 sought to accomplish the same result as taxation of the state's land, so was void because of its conflict with Idaho Const. art.

The fact that the base for computation of the sums to be paid was fixed at the assessed value of the lands at the time they were dropped from the assessment roll, did not divest the proceedings of their character as a tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the verdict was contrary to the evidence because the salesperson to whom he offered the check did not accept it or part with anything of value.

The court explained that the making or uttering of the check was sufficient although the payee might reject the check such that there was no completed delivery. The court found that the completion of the crime under &sect; 18-3106 did not depend upon the success of the enterprise.

The court ruled further that Idaho Code &sect; 23-1009 required the county to issue a license if the application conformed to the statutory provisions. The court held that the use of the word, &quot;shall,&quot; in &sect; 23-1009 made issuance of the license a duty of the county with such conditions and terms permitted by Idaho Code &sect; 23-1015 and that such terms and conditions adopted by the county were not permitted to be unreasonable, unjust, or unduly oppressive.

The court held that its role in admitting or excluding attorneys was not merely ministerial and, while the legislature could impose minimum standards under its police power in order to protect public interests, those standards did not constitute the ultimate qualifications beyond which the court could not go in fixing additional qualifications that it deemed necessary for the proper administration of judicial functions. Accordingly, the statute invaded the judicial power in violation of the constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the settlement and ending of a strike against a telephone company, defendants, employees of an electric company, continued picketing, carrying the same placards, and employees of the telephone company therefore declined to work and its service was restricted. Defendants were convicted of secondary boycotts and appealed their convictions. They argued that the secondary picketing statutes were unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that where claims of behalf of free speech were met with claims on behalf of the authority of the state to impose reasonable regulations for the protection of the community of a while, the duty of the court was plain. Whenever state action was challenged as a denial of liberty, the question always was whether the state violated the essential attributes of that liberty. The court stated that there was nothing in the decree that restrained defendants from informing the public of any labor dispute they might have with the peddlers by any lawful means of dissemination of information. Under those circumstances the court held that the decree did not contravene defendants' free speech rights.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that at the time of the alleged sale, such conduct constituted a misdemeanor only. The court found the evidence showed that defendant was not entrapped because he was given the opportunity either to make a sale or refuse to do so, and that he chose to sell. Therefore, he was not entitled to instructions on that defense. The court agreed that the statute under which the State charged defendant was not fully operative at the time he was arrested. The court found, however, that defendant was not entitled to be discharged because the essential act charged against him constituted the misdemeanor crime of the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor; therefore, the court remanded for imposition of a misdemeanor sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted as charged, and he appealed his conviction. In affirming, the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to justify the verdict. Even though reasonable minds might differ as to the conclusion to be drawn therefrom, it was within the province of the jury to reach the conclusion that defendant was intoxicated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was based on the findings that the ordinance was an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of the City's police power and deprived them of their property without due process of law.

I, &sect; 13 by depriving the owners of the use of their property by the business's sale and restricting the leasing of the realty. The ordinance's declaration that an ownership change was a new business was an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of police power by preventing the sale of an existing business that constituted a lawful, although non-conforming, use of the realty. The ordinance did not support the stated goals of facilitating policing and health inspections and preventing loitering and nuisances because the city authorities still needed to continue to police and inspect the businesses in the area to which the ordinance applied.</SPAN></P>

The candidate argued that the amendment violated art. XX, &sect; 1 because there was a conflict in the amendment as proposed and as ratified by the electorate, in that the words &quot;state auditor&quot; were included in the list of state officers in the question submitted to the voters but were omitted from the amendment after it was approved. The court, which had issued an alternative writ directing the secretary of state to show cause, quashed the alternative writ and denied the candidate's application for a permanent writ. The legislative history of the amendment indicated that the legislature did not amend the resolution as introduced to eliminate the state auditor from art. IV, &sect; 1. The omission of these words was purely a clerical error by the engrossing clerk, and the title and content of the resolution disclosed an intent to retain such officer as a constitutional officer.</SPAN></P>

Laws 237, part of the Public Assistance Law, appellant State of Idaho brought suit against respondent executor to recover amounts paid in old-age assistance to the decedent during his lifetime. The District Court, Second Judicial District, Clearwater County (Idaho) sustained the executor's demurrer to the complaint and dismissed the action. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executor argued that granting assistance to the decedent was in effect a loan, thereby violating Idaho Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2 that stated the credit of the State was not to be given or loaned to any person. The court stated that the grant was unconditional as far as a recipient was concerned. It created no obligation for him to repay public assistance to which he was lawfully entitled. The granting of aid by a state to its needy aged was a well-recognized obligation; it followed that the granting of such aid was not within constitutional inhibitions unless the recovery features of the statute made the law subject to such inhibitions. The liability of the State was not increased by the recovery provision. The State received the benefit of the recovery provisions and should be classified as a recipient of credit rather than as a giver thereof. Furthermore, the State could impose conditions upon the exercise of the right to dispose of one's property after death. Next, the recovery provision was not local or special legislation in violation of Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 19. The provision operated upon all the aged needy and their estates in like situations.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found the district court properly dismissed defendant's claim predicated on judicial delay in carrying out the death sentence. The limitations of Idaho Code &sect; 19-2719 applied to defendant's second petition; thus, defendant waived all claims for relief that reasonably should have been known when he filed his first petition. Ineffective assistance of counsel in defendant's first post-conviction proceeding did not excuse his failure to raise issues that should reasonably have been known.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed from a death sentence following his conviction for murder and also challenged denial of his application for post-conviction relief. Defendant argued the trial court erred, among a host of other things, in admitting evidence of defendant's uncharged prior bad act and for imposing death when the sentence was not proportionate or just and the death penalty structure was unconstitutional. The court found Idaho R. Evid. 404(b) allowed admission of the evidence because it was relevant to impeachment and defendant opened the door to admission of the evidence by testifying he had never fired the murder weapon. Also, the court found that invalidation of one or more aggravating circumstances did not implicate proportionality because the lower court had determined that any one of the aggravating circumstance, standing alone, outweighed all the mitigating circumstances, thus the death sentence was justified. Defendant's presented evidence failed to support his unconstitutionality argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Board of Professional Discipline of the Idaho State Board of Medicine (Board) issued a disciplinary order against appellant licensed physician. Appellant contended that the Board's order was not supported by substantial evidence, that administrative regulations IDAPA 22.01.01.101.03.d and IDAPA 22.01.01.101.04.d, adopted by the Board, were unconstitutional, and that he was subjected to selective enforcement by the Board. The court found the record contained substantial evidence to support the Board's factual findings, and no basis to conclude that appellant was treated differently from any other licensed physician, and that regulation IDAPA 22.01.01.101.04 was constitutional. However, the court held that IDAPA 22.01.01101.03.d, designating sexual contact, misconduct, exploitation or intercourse as a measure to gauge the provision of health care, was not within the scope of Idaho Code &sect; 54-1814(7), and therefore was in excess of the authority of the Board to promulgate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, city council and city, appealed a judgment from the District Court of the Fifth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Twin Falls County, that reversed a zoning decision by defendant city council, and denied its request to delete certain items from the transcript for the record on appeal. Plaintiff cross-appealed in order to determine whether sufficient evidence supported defendant city's action, and it requested attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying defendant city's request to delete some documents from the record for the appeal because it served judicial economy and was mandated by Idaho App. R. 25(c) and 28(b). The court reversed the judgment that overturned defendant city council's denial of a special use permit. The court found the requirement of Idaho Code &sect; 10-9-2(M)(4)(c) was not an unconstitutional prior restraint on commercial free speech because it had sufficiently objective and definite standards to guide zoning officials to make zoning decisions. The court affirmed the finding that substantial evidence supported defendant city council's denial of a special use permit. Photographs and sketches were introduced of the area with the proposed billboard. The record showed that city council members viewed the photographs supplied and applied their reasoned judgment when they denied the permit. The court concluded that because defendant city council denied the special use permit, plaintiff was not the prevailing party and was not entitled to attorney fees under Idaho Code &sect; 12-117. Defendants were not entitled to attorney fees because plaintiff presented legitimate issues on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order overturning the denial of a special use permit was reversed because the city code's requirements were not an unconstitutional prior restraint on commercial free speech.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landowners, sued by plaintiff water supplier for failing to pay irrigation maintenance costs, appealed the rulings of the District Court of the Seventh Judicial District, Bingham County, Idaho, and of the Snake River Basin Adjudication Court of the Fifth Judicial District, Twin Falls County, Idaho, favoring plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff water supplier sued defendant landowners, seeking foreclosure on liens levied due to defendants' failure to pay irrigation maintain costs. Defendants counterclaimed on grounds of forfeiture, statutory unconstitutionality, civil rights violations, and unjust enrichment. The cases were adjudicated in stages before different trial courts because of jurisdictional concerns. Those courts found in favor of plaintiff and against defendants. On appeal, those rulings were affirmed. The court held the assessment of irrigation maintain costs on the subject properties was proper given the benefit inuring to those properties, including those properties not requiring irrigation systems, in water-scarce areas. In addition, since the statutes in question did not violate either substantive or procedural due process, plaintiffs lacked a viable civil rights complaint. Finally, the court found no error in the rejection of defendants' forfeiture-of-water-rights claim because such a claim was disfavored. The court also found that defendants' failure-to-prosecute counterclaim was properly denied due to lack of prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial courts' orders favoring plaintiff were affirmed. The court found that plaintiff possessed the right to impose irrigation maintenance costs on defendants even though defendants were not using plaintiff's water because of the benefit to defendants from increase in their neighbors' property values as a result of the water use. The court found that defendants' counterclaims lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

Appellee board decided that appellant was a qualified applicant for three lease auctions, but later disqualified appellant as the high bidder in two of them.

Appellant then challenged a trial court ruling which upheld appellee's decision. The appeals court reversed and remanded the matter to appellee for new auctions of the leases on which appellant was not allowed to bid. The court ruled that the statute violated Idaho Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought a writ of prohibition challenging the constitutionality of a congressional resolution, approved by the electorate, amending Idaho Const. art. 9, &sect;&sect; 4 and 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A house joint resolution proposing to amend Idaho Const. art. 9, &sect;&sect; 4 and 8, was adopted by the state legislation and was approved by the electorate. Petitioners sought a writ of prohibition barring the implementation of the resolution, claiming that the issue was illegally presented to the voters. On review, the state supreme court concluded that because the alleged procedural defects were not misleading, the petitioners' statutory and constitutional challenges to the procedures were time barred where they were not presented before the election. However, in granting the requested relief, the court concluded that because the proposed amendments to the two sections did not in any way depend upon one another, they were incongruous and essentially unrelated. Consequently, they should have been submitted separately to the voters, and the amendments proposed by the single resolution violated the single subject rule of Idaho Const. art. 20, &sect; 2, which required that if two or more amendments were proposed, they must be submitted in such a manner that the voters could vote for or against each proposed amendment separately.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for a writ of prohibition was granted, for the house joint resolution was improperly submitted to the electorate in violation of the single subject rule of Idaho Const. art. 20, &sect; 2, where it presented essentially unrelated issues in a single resolution for voter consideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant organization challenged a judgment from the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Ada County (Idaho), affirming appellee board's decision to reject 14 of appellant's 1995 lease applications for grazing leases on state endowment lands, and to award the leases to the prior lessee without an auction. Appellant challenged the constitutional validity of Idaho Code &sect; 58-310B, which set forth criteria considered by appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant organization submitted 16 conflict applications for grazing leases on state endowment lands in 1995. Appellee board rejected 14 of appellant's lease applications and awarded the leases to the prior lessee without an auction. Thereafter, appellant challenged appellee's decision and the constitutional validity of Idaho Code &sect; 58-310B, which set forth criteria for determining whether an applicant was qualified to bid on a lease at auction. The trial court affirmed appellee's decision and held that the statute was constitutional. However, the reviewing court reversed and remanded the matter to appellee for new auctions of the 1995 leases for which appellant was not allowed to bid. The court based its ruling on a companion case regarding appellant's 1996 applications, in which it found Idaho Code &sect; 58-310B to be violative of the Idaho constitution. In that case, the court held that the statute impermissibly directed the focus on schools, the state, and the livestock industry in assessing lease applications, all to the detriment of other potential bidders who might provide &quot;maximum long term financial return&quot; to the schools, but not to the state and livestock industry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's wife was murdered, defendant presented himself to police to inquire whether he was a suspect and whether he could leave the country to visit family. Following an interview with police, defendant was arrested for his wife's murder. He appealed his second-degree murder conviction, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress informant testimony and his statements to police. In affirming, the appellate court concluded that the informant's testimony was properly admitted, as the informant did not unconstitutionally interrogate defendant to obtain a confession. The informant had no relevant contact with the police before defendant made his admissions; he was thus not acting as a police agent, and his testimony was not suppressible. Further, the appellate court rejected defendant's argument that his statements to police should have been suppressed where he was not given his Miranda rights. It was unnecessary for the police to give Miranda rights where defendant was not in police custody but voluntarily presented himself for an interview; the non-custodial statements were voluntarily made and were admissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation challenged a judgment of the District Court of the Fifth Judicial District, Minidoka County (Idaho), which granted appellee agency's motion for summary judgment in appellant's case alleging that Idaho Code &sect; 63-3622D violated appellant's equal protection rights guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV regarding payment of use tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation received notices of deficiency determinations (NODs) from appellee agency for use taxes. Appellant timely protested the NODs and, following the hearing, the assessed tax penalty was upheld and appellant filed a petition for judicial review. Appellant contended that Idaho Code &sect; 63-3622D discriminated against it by requiring a use tax. Appellee moved to dismiss because appellant failed to comply with Idaho Code &sect; 63-3049(b) and make a 20 percent deposit to appellee within 91 days of receiving notice of appellee's decision. The trial court granted appellee's motion, however, appellant was permitted to amend its petition and request a declaratory judgment regarding the statute's unconstitutionality. Appellee was granted summary judgment and appellant challenged the decision. The court affirmed the trial court's decision and reasoned that because appellant's complaint dealt with appellee's use tax decision, allowing appellant to amend its petition to seek a declaratory judgment, without requiring compliance with Idaho Code &sect; 63-3049 (b), would not be fair. Moreover, the trial court lacked the authority to permit appellant's amendment of its petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court erred in granting summary judgment on a claim alleging that the legislature had to provide a means for school districts to fund facilities that provided a safe environment conducive to learning. A safe environment conducive to learning was inherently a part of the thorough system of public, free common schools that Idaho Const. art. IX, &sect; 1 required the legislature to establish and maintain. The legislature's constitutional obligation could not be read to allow unsafe schools, unconducive to learning. The state did not present evidence showing the existing school facilities provided a safe environment, conducive to learning. The State did not eliminate genuine issues of material fact. Plaintiffs' claims that the education funding scheme was unconstitutionally unequal failed because Idaho Const. art. IX, &sect; 1 did not apply to funding. The trial court did not abuse discretion in not allowing a State third-party complaint against superintendents of the school districts that were plaintiffs. The trial court did not err in denying a State request that the trial court dismiss individual plaintiffs whose school districts were unnamed as plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the trial court judgment which held the disorderly conduct ordinance, under which defendants were cited, to be constitutional. They claimed that the ordinance was vague on its face because it provided no clear guidelines to persons subject to it and to those who must enforce it in a fair and nondiscriminatory manner. They argued that using the word &quot;may&quot; rather than a word such as &quot;shall,&quot; which would denote a mandatory inclusion of the five examples as criminal acts, rendered the ordinance uncertain and incapable of fair and nondiscriminatory enforcement. The state urged the court to apply a &quot;vague as applied&quot; analysis by determining that the conduct with which defendants were charged was clearly conduct that was proscribed by the ordinance. The court affirmed the district court and found the ordinance to be constitutional. The list of examples in the disorderly conduct ordinance provided guidelines for citizens seeking to conform their conduct to the ordinance and for the police to enforce the ordinance in a fair and unbiased manner. Use of the word &quot;may&quot; demonstrated that a police officer, exercising discretion, may find other acts to violate the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff entered into a real estate purchase agreement with defendants, under which she agreed to assume defendants' FHA loan. The agreement provided that defendants would convey title free of all liens and encumbrances except for the loan. After the purchase was competed, plaintiff discovered that the property was subject to a recapture obligation that accrued during defendants' period of ownership. When defendants refused to compensate plaintiff for the amount of the obligation, she filed suit for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. On review, plaintiff argued the trial court erred in ruling that the parol evidence rule and the doctrine of merger precluded her breach of contract claim. The appeals court affirmed. The court reasoned that the express terms of the warranty deed indicated that the conveyance was subject to the loan and the recapture obligation. Because an agreement that plaintiff would only assume the loan was inconsistent with the agreement in the deed, the doctrine of merger barred the claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Sixth Judicial District, Bannock County (Idaho), dismissing his petition for post-conviction relief. Defendant claimed his murder conviction was reversible because, inter alia, the trial court improperly failed to disqualify itself and because he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to murder. The death sentence was imposed. Defendant's post-conviction relief petition was denied. Defendant appealed, claiming the trial court improperly failed to disqualify itself and that his counsel was ineffective. The appellate court vacated the trial court's finding of a third aggravating factor and affirmed. Although the judge was affiliated with the victims through his church, this alone was not a reasonable basis for disqualification. Defense counsel's decision not to move to disqualify the judge based on the belief that the judge be less inclined to impose the death penalty was a rational tactical decision that could not second-guessed on review. Further, because defendant failed to prove that but for counsel's various errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different, no ineffectiveness was shown. However, where counsel did not know whether a psychiatric report was favorable or unfavorable, his failure to object to its admission constituted ineffective assistance. Thus, an aggravating factor based on the report was vacated. Remand was unnecessary because the omission of this factor would not alter the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment of sentence imposing the death penalty against defendant. Although the judge was affiliated with people involved in the case through his church, this alone was insufficient to justify disqualification. Although defense counsel allegedly committed some errors, because the result would not have been different without the errors, defendant's murder conviction and death sentence were upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a death sentence imposed upon his guilty plea to first degree murder and the denial of petition for post-conviction relief from the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Ada County, arguing, inter alia, that the district court committed reversible error by significantly changing its findings in support of the death sentence in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand of the case to allow defendant to present mitigating evidence, which he was not allowed to do at a sentencing hearing, the district court changed a mitigating factor to an aggravating factor upon resentencing. On appeal, the court held that the district court was not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause from reconsidering existing information, changing mitigating factors, and weighing evidence differently at a resentencing hearing. The court explained that the district court consistently imposed the death penalty at both the defendant's original sentencing and resentencing hearings. The only difference at the resentencing was that after the court received additional information from an updated presentence report, which was compiled at defendant's request, it reinterpreted its finding with respect to the circumstances surrounding the attack of the victim. Thus, it was not error for the district court to change its finding where the district court considered all of the evidence presented and simply reinterpreted its earlier mitigation finding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction, the imposition of the death sentence and the denial of defendant's petition for post-conviction relief.

In October 1994, she went to her doctor and complained that she was having intermittent pain in her neck, and that she'd had the pain for two years. The doctor recommended physical therapy. The next day she filed with her employer a Notice of Injury and Claim for Benefits, noting that she had pain in her neck and shoulders. The next month she reported to her doctor that she was better because she was wearing a headset but that the physical therapy was not working. She missed no time from work due to her ailment. In November 1995, she filed an unsuccessful worker's compensation complaint with the commission seeking medical benefits for pain to her left shoulder and upper back. On appeal, the court affirmed, agreeing with the commission's finding that because the employee's impairment did not actually and totally incapacitate her from performing her employment duties, she was not disabled; therefore, under Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 72-102(21) (Supp. 1998) and 72-437, she was not entitled to benefits for an occupational disease.

The court stated that on review of a denial of a motion for acquittal the court must look at all facts and inferences and determine whether there was substantial evidence to support the conviction. The court noted that the state's expert stated that it was unlikely that the child's injuries occurred from an earlier unobserved fall because the child would have exhibited some sign of injury. The court held that the evidence supported the jury's verdict because reasonable minds could have concluded that defendant's hypothesis of an earlier injury was unreasonable thus defendant's motion of acquittal was properly denied. The court stated that defendant's motion in limine was properly denied because the trial court refused to allow the state's experts to testify as to whether the injuries could have been accidental. The court found that the reports used by the state's experts possessed sufficient indicia of reliability under Idaho R. Evid. 702 and were properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. Because the amount of the employee's financial loss was dependent upon the employee's wages prior to her injury, it was reasonable for the legislature to consider the employee's average weekly wage in determining benefits under Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 72-408 and 72-409. The difference in benefits between workers earning higher rates of pay and workers earning lower rates of pay was rationally related to the legislature's legitimate goal of compensating injured workers in proportion to their financial loss. Thus, Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 72-408 and 72-409 did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The district court dismissed the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was killed when, while working for the employer, stacks of wood fell on him. In the administrator's suit for negligence and wrongful death, the district court dismissed the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court also rejected the administrator's claims that worker's compensation statutes, which denied certain benefits to certain classes of children of deceased worker's, were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court ruled that the district court properly concluded that the worker's compensation statutes,&nbsp;Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 72-201 and 72-221, were the exclusive remedy for claims for injuries arising out of and sustained during the course of employment. The administrator's wrongful death and negligence claims thus were properly dismissed. The court next rejected the administrator's claim that Idaho Code &sect;72-413, which provided dependent, but not adult independent, children of a deceased worker a benefit, violated the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The court ruled that the different treatment of classes of children was rationally related to the state's goal of providing monetary relief to dependent children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney fees awarded to the environmental organization by the trial court was based on the trial judge's conclusion that the state's activities in administrative proceedings held to determine water rights in a river basin were activities permitting compensation under the private attorney general doctrine. The state disagreed and appealed. On appeal, the court reversed. It held that the totality of the circumstances did not permit the granting of attorney fees to the environmental organization, inasmuch as the organization neither secured relief for the public nor was an organization formed to protect the public's interests. As both of those matters were essential prerequisites to the awarding of attorney fees, their absence was fatal to the environmental organization's claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a company and its owner, sought review of an order of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Elmore County, which, based upon a determination that the company was marketing a security in violation of various provisions of the Idaho Securities Act, Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 30-1401 to 30-1458, granted summary judgment in favor of respondent Idaho Department of Finance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company solicited a fee from customers to enter their names in a Bureau of Land Management lottery for gas and oil leases. A portion of the payment was profit to the company for preparing and filing customer applications in the lottery, and a portion was combined with like payments from 19 other customers and applied to the payment of a $ 75 filing fee and advance lease payment on government-owned lands. The program was marketed as having the potential for obtaining valuable oil and gas reserves. The district court determined that the company was marketing an &quot;investment contract&quot; constituting a security and granted summary judgment to the department on various claims.The company appealed, and the owner appealed the court's determination that he was personally liable, pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 30-1442(3), for any violations of the act by the company. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the economic realities of the transaction did not amount to investing, as customers simply paid a fee to the company for its service of entering their names in a lottery. The court further held that the district court erred in determining that the company was marketing a security.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's decisions, which held that the company violated the Idaho Securities Act and extended personal liability for those violations to the owner.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder for violently beating his former girlfriend to death. On direct appeal from the trial court, defendant contended that it was error to deny him a second court-appointed attorney.

Defendant's allegation that the state prejudiced his case by allowing the cremation of the victim's body was found to be a meritless claim by the court on appeal because there was no indication that defendant was prejudiced by that alleged destruction of evidence. The court also affirmed the death penalty sentence because the evidence in the record supported it. Accordingly, the court affirmed defendant's conviction for first-degree murder and his death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposal instructed the state's legislators to use their powers to pass an amendment imposing term limits on legislators and included a pledge for non-incumbent candidates to support the measure. The secretary was given the responsibility to review the legislators' records and identify them in the legend of reelection ballots if they did not support the measure. The proposition was challenged as unconstitutional. The court held that the ballot legend and pledge portions of the proposition were unconstitutional and issued a writ of prohibition as to them. The ballot legend was an unconstitutional state-imposed consequence for speech and debate in the legislature. The pledge was an attempt by the state to govern political speech without showing any flagrant abuse of the right by compelling candidates to take a stance on the proposed amendment. The instructions were held not to be an unconstitutional attempt to allow the voters to ratify a federal constitutional amendment. The ballot legends and the non-incumbent candidate pledge were not integral or indispensable to the proposition, therefore the remaining portions of the proposition remained in effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared that the ballot legends and the pledge were unconstitutional and issued a writ of prohibition that prohibited the secretary from carrying them out. The court declared that the instructions in the proposition were not unconstitutional and severed them from the unconstitutional portions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lot owner filed an action for trespass and conversion against defendants, a city, an employee, and unidentified persons, after the city removed items from the owner's property on the grounds that they were litter, junk, or garbage. The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Ada County, granted summary judgment to the city. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being cited for zoning, housing, and litter ordinance violations, the owner did not respond to the citations. Eventually, the city authorized a clean-up of the property, and a contractor removed lawn mowers that were in pieces, bike parts, bike tires, a rusty oil barrel, more than 60 tires, various construction materials, and tree limbs from the property. The owner then filed his present action. He claimed that the items removed had value. The court stated that the city had the authority to control litter and nuisances within its limits under Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 50-317 and 50-334 and Boise, Idaho, City Code &sect;&sect; 6-16-14 and 8-8-2. The city was entitled to determine whether certain items were litter or trash, but in making this determination, it ran the risk of being sued for taking property of value from the owner. Here, the owner's affidavit and deposition raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the items were trash, garbage, or litter. The owner indicated that he intended to use the items and that they were not discarded. Thus, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the district court's grant of summary judgment. It remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The imate had been convicted of first degree murder for the death of his estranged wife. The district court held that an unsigned search warrant was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police executed the search warrant at a home on the Nez Perce Reservation without obtaining prior approval of a county judge. The police conferred with the Bureau of Indian Management, the tribal prosecutor, the Idaho Attorney General and, the United States Attorney before executing the warrant. The search uncovered the murder weapon and shoes matching footprints at the crime scene. The homeowner had questioned the validity of the search warrant by pointing out that it was not signed or dated. On appeal, the court vacated and remanded. In a case of first impression, the court held that, under Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 17, a search warrant must conform strictly to the constitution and applicable statutes. Moreover, Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 19-4401, -4406, and -4407 created a substantive right in a citizen to refuse to permit a search pursuant to an unsigned warrant. The requirement of a signed warrant enabled a citizen to know that the search was authorized and was not the whim of the officer. Once the lack of a signature was discovered, the police should have stopped the search. The homeowner had exercised her right to question the warrant's validity, thus, the evidence was inadmissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated and held that the district court erred in summarily disposing of the inmate's post-conviction application. The court remanded to the district court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted and sentenced to a fixed term of 15 years as required by Idaho Code &sect; 37-2732B(a)(5)(C). Defendant appealed, arguing that &sect; 37-2732B(a)(8), which provided the mandatory minimum sentencing, was unconstitutional. The court held that in 1978, the legislature proposed and the people ratified an amendment to Idaho Const. art. V. &sect; 13 that stated that any mandatory minimum sentence could not be reduced. An appellate court found that &sect; 37-2732(a)(8) was unconstitutional because it allowed for the reduction on statutory minimums. In 1995 Idaho Legislature amended &sect; 37-2732B by deleting subsection (a)(8). Section 37-2732B, after the 1995 amendment, fully complied with the requirement of Idaho Const. art.

Defendant had requested jury instructions at trial regarding the defenses of consent by the girls and defendant's mistake as to the age of the girls. The trial court denied defendant's requests and convicted defendant. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that defendant was not entitled to claim that he mistakenly believed that the girls were 18 years of age, because the mistake of fact defense provided in Idaho Code &sect; 18-201(1) was no defense to the charge of sexual battery of a minor child 16 or 17 years of age. The court held that consent of the minor was not a legal defense to Idaho Code &sect; 18-1508A. The court held that &sect; 18-1508A was not unconstitutionally vague because the statute gave notice of what sexual contact was, provided guidelines, and imposed sufficient discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave defendant adequate notice of the obligation it imposed. The court held that defendant's arrest was not premature and did not violate standards of equal protection because the evidence showed that he had five full working days to register even if Saturday and Sunday were excluded. The court held that defendant was not legally prevented from complying with &sect; 18-8304 because an officer would have come to him to get him registered.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The oil company filed an action against the fund, seeking an order that the petroleum transfer fee charged under the Idaho Petroleum Clean Water Trust Fund Act, Idaho Code &sect; 41-4908(7), constituted a gasoline tax. Because the Idaho Constitution required that proceeds of any tax on gasoline were to be dedicated exclusively to the construction, repair, maintenance, and traffic supervision of public highways, the oil company sought to obtain a refund of fees paid and to have the fee declared unconstitutional. The trial court entered partial summary judgment in favor of the oil company. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that, to the extent that the petroleum transfer fee was assessed against gasoline and like motor vehicle fuels, the allocation of the proceeds of that fee to the fund violated Idaho Const. art. VII, &sect; 17. However, the oil company was not entitled to a refund because the creation and collection of the transfer fee was not unconstitutional. Rather, the appropriation of the revenue, raised from the transfer fee, to the fund was unconstitutional. Thus, the revenue was to be appropriated by the legislature for uses consistent with Idaho Const. art. VII, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the jury rendered its verdict in favor of the physician, the patient filed a motion for new trial on the ground that the county's jury selection procedure systematically excluded Hispanic persons in violation of Idaho Code &sect; 2-213 and his constitutional rights to a fair and impartial jury. The district court denied the motion and the patient appealed. The court noted that there was no question that the patient failed to comply with the time limitations imposed by &sect; 2-213. The patient contended that if &sect; 2-213 was interpreted to preclude his separate constitutional challenges, the application of that provision resulted in a denial of due process. The court disagreed and affirmed the denial of the motion, holding that a civil litigant was required to raise his objections to a jury panel in the manner prescribed by statute. Because &sect; 2-213 provided civil litigants timely notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard on issues relating to jury selection, the court held that it did not effect a denial of due process to require the patient to present his challenge to the jury selection process within the provisions of &sect; 2-213.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant enacted an ordinance intended to protect the rights of private landowners. Plaintiff brought a declaratory judgment action and the trial court granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that plaintiff had standing and that the case was ripe for judicial review. The court found that the provisions of the ordinance were preempted by federal law because they imposed restrictions on federal agencies that were inconsistent with federal laws authorizing acquisition of land. The court found that the ordinance conflicted with the authority of federal agencies concerning the withdrawal of federal land. The court noted that none of the federal land laws gave local governmental units veto power over decisions by federal agencies charged with managing federal land. Defendant's attempted veto power was contrary to the provisions of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1531-1543; the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1275-1276; and the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1132.</SPAN></P>

The court issued the writ, found that the attorney general's short and long ballot titles were insufficient under &sect; 34-1809, and ruled that the signatures collected on the petitions with the defective titles were invalid. Because the initiative would have amended existing statutory law, the attorney general had a duty under &sect; 34-1809 to include in the short title the fact that the initiative would delete and add exceptions to Idaho's existing ban on post-viability abortions and to set forth in the short title what distinguished the initiative from existing law. The court found that the long title failed to provide voters with an accurate description of the purposes of the initiative, and the court provided acceptable short and long title language.</SPAN></P>

The court held further that the magistrate did not err in admitting certain extrinsic and parol evidence because the language of the decedent's estate plan with respect to the meaning of the document was ambiguous. Further, the court held that the magistrate's reliance on certain parol evidence did not violate the statute of frauds, Idaho Code &sect; 9-503, because all of the trust documents were in writing and that the magistrate properly admitted and relied upon the decedent's prior wills to show her intent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">IDWR adopted administrative rules concerning conjunctive management of ground water and surface water rights for the entire state. The canal companies filed a petition against IDWR in the Snake River Basin Adjudication (SRBA) seeking declaratory relief pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 67-5278 (1995) declaring the rules invalid. IDWR moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that the SRBA district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the petition for declaratory relief. The SRBA district court denied IDWR's motion and an appeal was taken. The court held that the canal companies could not seek declaratory relief in SRBA against the IDWR because IDWR could not be joined as a party to SRBA. Under Idaho Code &sect; 42-1401A(4), the director of IDWR was defined to include the IDWR, and therefore the canal companies could not pursue their action for declaratory judgment as part of SRBA. The legislature had removed the director as a party to the adjudication.

Those statutes were later amended. Inter alia, the trial court determined that the amended statutes were unconstitutional, unseverable, and had no effect on the previous statutes. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The legislature's direction that the contents of the director's report would constitute prima facie evidence of some water right claims was a permissible. Idaho Code &sect; 42-1423 (1994), which prohibited an award of attorney fees, was a legitimate exercise of the legislature's substantive authority. The director could be withdrawn as a party through the amendment of the statute that gave him that designation. To the extent that Idaho Code &sect; 42-1401B(1) constituted a legislative determination as to the director's status as an expert, that provision was of no effect. Because striking the unconstitutional portions did not prevent the remaining provisions of that legislation from functioning as intended, the unconstitutional provisions could be severed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that its limited jurisdiction as an SRBA court did not provide it with the authority to consider the public trust doctrine when decreeing water rights.

It found that the trial court correctly concluded that the public trust doctrine was not an element of a water right that should be used to determine the priority of that right in relation to competing claims of other water right claimants. The court observed that the legislature eliminated the need for an SRBA court to consider the local public interest in determining the nature and extent of expanded or changed water rights by repealing portions of the Idaho Code. Because the grounds upon which the conservation groups were granted limited intervention were repealed, the court vacated their motion to intervene.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the jury instruction on the definition of reasonable doubt, particularly the use of the phrases &quot;moral evidence&quot; and &quot;moral certainty,&quot; were not unconstitutional in the context of the jury instructions as a whole. And, the district court did not violate either Idaho Ct. R. 32(e) or Idaho Code &sect; 19-2516 by considering during sentencing a co-defendant's statement, which was included in the presentence report. The court refused to adopt the absolute position that statements from a co-defendant were inherently unreliable. There was independent evidence of motive, intent, and a connection to the murder weapon that provided at least some minimum indicia of reliability in that it tended to corroborate the co-defendant's statement that defendant committed the murder. Thus, defendant was not denied due process by the consideration of the co-defendant's statement. The court affirmed the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

The court found the burden that was placed on the insanity by &sect; 66-337(d) for gaining release by proving that he was without danger to himself or others was unconstitutional, and violated due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner applied for a writ of habeas corpus seeking release from hospital confinement, claiming he was no longer mentally ill. A magistrate determined that Idaho Code &sect; 66-337(d), which allowed for continued confinement of insanity acquittees on the basis of dangerousness alone, was unconstitutional. Although petitioner's mental state was such that he was not civilly committable, the magistrate found that he continued to suffer from the mental condition that was the basis for the acquittal. Finding petitioner to be dangerous, he denied the petition, the district court agreed and, on appeal, the court affirmed. Substantial evidence supported the finding of dangerousness, given petitioner's predatory tendencies with regard to children. Moreover, competent evidence showed that he continued to suffer from a mental condition that was the basis of his acquittal. Thus, continued confinement was not objectionable on due process grounds.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was acquitted of charges of first degree murder by reason of insanity in 1972. He filed a petition for habeas corpus in the magistrate court on the basis of a U.S. Supreme Court decision prohibiting confinement based on dangerousness alone. The magistrate declared Idaho Code &sect; 66-337(d), the confinement statute, unconstitutional. The Seventh Judicial District Court, Bingham County (Idaho), reversed. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The magistrate found, and the district court agreed, that under Foucha v. Louisiana, Idaho Code &sect; 66-337(d) was unconstitutional because it allowed the continued confinement of insanity acquittees on the basis of dangerousness alone. In this case, the magistrate's finding that the petitioner was still dangerous was supported by substantial and competent evidence. In addition, the evidence demonstrated that petitioner had a very fixed personality disorder that was unchanged from the time of acquittal. The magistrate's finding that petitioner's mental condition had changed was clearly erroneous. Because the basis for petitioner's criminal acquittal and commitment persisted, Foucha did not require that he be released, and it did not require that his continued commitment be justified anew by civil commitment proceedings. The court concluded that the mental condition of petitioner was constitutionally sufficient to justify his automatic commitment upon acquittal, and it remained sufficient to justify his continued commitment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's determination that the writ of habeas corpus should be granted, and held that although the Idaho confinement statute was unconstitutional, the finding that petitioner continued to be dangerous required the denial of the writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

The policies of the officer's jurisdiction provided that an officer did not have authority to impound a vehicle if the owner of the vehicle was not under arrest, had a valid driver's license, and claimed to be capable of driving. The officer did not take the time to ascertain, as a person of reasonable caution would do, whether the mother, who was not under arrest, had a valid driver's license and claimed to be capable of driving.

Defendants were sentenced pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 37-2732B(a)(2)(C) to 10 to 15 years for trafficking and to concurrent terms for the other charges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, an uncle and nephew, were arrested by agents for the immigration and naturalization service (INS) who were posing as cocaine buyers as part of an investigation of two other men who had arranged for defendants to transport cocaine from California to Idaho. The four men were tried together. Defendants claimed that they were entrapped, that the voluntariness of their statements was improperly submitted to a jury, and that &sect; 37-2732B was unconstitutional. The court agreed with their third claim based upon a case decided after defendants were sentenced. It vacated the sentences, remanded for resentencing, and affirmed the convictions. Defendants preserved their claim that they were entrapped by raising it in a motion to acquit, but they lacked standing because they were not the direct targets of the INS investigation. INS agents did not know defendants existed until the cocaine sale occurred. Whether an arrestee's Miranda waiver or statement was knowingly and voluntarily given was a question to be decided by the judge, not the jury, but any error of the trial court in submitting the question to the jury was harmless pursuant to Idaho Crim. R. 52 (1994).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lawyer represented a mother who sought an increase in child support from her ex-husband. The lawyer and the ex-husband's attorney tentatively reached an oral settlement agreement and neither the ex-husband nor his attorney appeared at the modification hearing. The lawyer did not inform the presiding magistrate judge that they had reached a tentative agreement. Accordingly, a default judgment was entered for the mother for the full amount sought. An ethics complaint was filed, and bar counsel determined that the lawyer had violated Rule 3.3(d) by failing to inform the magistrate judge of the negotiations and tentative agreement. The hearing committee upheld the imposition of a private reprimand. In denying the lawyer a petition for review, the supreme court ruled, inter alia, that the finding that the lawyer violated Rule 3.3(d) was not clearly erroneous because the proceeding was considered an ex parte proceeding when the ex-husband's attorney failed to appear, giving rise to a duty of candor toward the magistrate judge. Bar counsel's authority to impose discipline came from a delegation by the supreme court, not the executive or legislative branches.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed and the State filed a motion to dismiss defendant's appeal on the grounds that &sect; 19-2719 divested the trial court of jurisdiction to consider defendant's claims. The court held that neither the allegations in defendant's petition nor the documents filed in support of that petition satisfied the burden established by &sect; 19-2719. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion to disqualify the trial judge on the basis that the judge was a potential witness to the claims raised in defendant's amended petition, however, defendant presented no evidence that the possibility that the trial judge might have been a potential witness interfered with the trial court's ability to determine whether the jurisdictional bar of &sect; 19-2719 precluded defendant's petition.

On appeal, the court vacated the conviction. In so ruling, the court concluded that although the statute did not specifically prohibit speech or the expression of viewpoints of any specific interest group, it did reach substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct based on its prohibition against someone entering or remaining on property with the &quot;intent to interfere&quot; with lawful hunting of wildlife. The court ruled that &sect; 36-1510(1)(c) was unconstitutionally overbroad because it did not require physical interference and it was not limited to prohibiting unprotected speech, such as fighting words or obscenity; thus the statute compromised expression protected by the First Amendment. The court further concluded that &sect; 36-1510(1)(c) was not an indispensable part of the statute and could be stricken therefrom, leaving the rest of the statute is fully operative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowners disputed decisions of the District Court of the Fifth Judicial District, Minidoka County (Idaho), which denied their motion to dismiss a forfeiture proceeding brought under Idaho Code &sect; 37-2744A, granted summary judgment for respondent Idaho Department of Law Enforcement (department), and issued a civil forfeiture order. The court considered whether &sect; 37-2744A violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII or Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the homeowners pled guilty to a charge that, in the bedroom of the home, she delivered one-quarter ounce of marijuana, valued at $ 60, to a police informant. On appeal, the court noted that &sect; 37-2744A was modeled on, and virtually identical to, 21 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 881(a)(4) and (a)(7). The Excessive Fines Clause of U.S. Const. amend. VIII applied to civil in rem forfeitures under the federal statute. The court held that the civil designation of &sect; 37-2744A was not dispositive, and the statute was punitive at least in part. So, the Excessive Fines Clause applied to in rem forfeitures made pursuant to &sect; 37-2744A, and summary judgment was improperly granted on that issue. The court held that Idaho Code &sect; 37-2744A(e) did not preclude the possibility that the forfeiture could be excessive. The court remanded the case to the district court for an initial determination under circumstances where the excessiveness issue could be fully litigated. Further, the court held that, based on art. I, &sect; 7, there was a right to jury trial for forfeiture proceedings under &sect; 37-2744A. The court struck the subsection denying the right to a jury trial as unconstitutional. But, dismissal was not required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's grant of the department's summary judgment motion, vacated the forfeiture order, and remanded the case to the district court.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed and modified the sentences of defendant two and defendant three accordingly. Because defendant one received a fixed sentence in excess of the sentences provided for in Idaho Code &sect; 37-2732B, the court concluded that its holding did not apply to him and affirmed his sentence. The court did not address the claim raised by defendant two and defendant three that the fines assessed against them were excessive, concluding that, because they failed to raise the issue at the trial court, it would not consider the issue because the imposition of the fines was not fundamental error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Idaho legislature was obligated to reapportion itself based on the census data. The legislature began working on reapportionment, but few people believed that a plan would be adopted quickly. A voter brought an action under the private attorney general doctrine to, among other things, set a date for the legislature to adopt a reapportionment plan or have the court determine reapportionment. Subsequently, the legislature passed a reapportionment bill that was signed by the governor. Consequently, the district court vacated the proceedings for court constructed reapportionment, issued its final judgment, and dismissed the matter without prejudice. The district court awarded of fees to the voter. On review, the court held the district court's exercise of discretion in awarding fees turned on whether the district court's factual determination was clearly erroneous. The court held that the legislature's self-imposed deadline for reapportioning itself was in direct response to the lawsuit. The district court was not clearly erroneous in its determination that private enforcement was needed. The district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both appellant carriers and respondent State challenged a decision from the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Ada County (Idaho), which entered partial summary judgment in favor of both parties, determining that certain interstate motor carriers were entitled to a refund of a portion of the fees they paid to renew their registration of Interstate Commerce Commission operating authority; and attorney fees of 25 percent were awarded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although Idaho Code &sect; 61-812 was violating the Commerce Clause when the suit was filed, it was subsequently amended to reduce the renewal fee, so the trial court did not have to declare it unconstitutional and did not enjoin its enforcement. The suit was certified as a class of all interstate carriers who paid the allegedly excessive fee. On review, the court agreed that two federal regulations were improperly combined to determine a permissible burden on interstate commerce. The court pointed out that regulations allowed the State to charge carriers a maximum of $ 10 to renew and $ 10 for vehicle identification, but the State had no law to charge interstate carriers for vehicle identification, and it had only adopted a $ 25 fee for interstate carrier registration, with no distinction between renewal or new registration. The court concluded that all carriers who paid the excessive fee were entitled to a $ 15 refund for each of the three years before the amendment. The court rejected the notion that the fees had to be paid under protest because although taxes funded public services at large, fees only covered the cost of the particular service the State provided to the individual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's opinion by finding that it erroneously combined two federal regulations to determine the permissible burden on interstate commerce and that it miscalculated the refund due to the carriers. The court held that no fees or costs would be awarded to either party on appeal. The trial court's opinion was otherwise affirmed, and the court remanded for further action consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband appealed from a judgment of the District Court, Bonner County (Idaho) that granted defendant wife a divorce on the grounds of extreme cruelty and awarded spousal maintenance in the amount of $ 1,700 per month for at least five years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A husband challenged a trial court judgment awarding his wife spousal maintenance of $ 1,700 for at least five years. The trial court found that the husband had abused the wife and that she suffered from post-traumatic distress disorder because of his abuse, needed therapy, and was unable to work. The trial court divided the personal property equally, but found that even after the division of the community property, the wife lacked liquid assets to support herself. The court held that the substantial and competent evidence standard of review applied to the amount and duration of a maintenance award, and found that there was substantial and competent evidence to support the trial court's finding that the wife was entitled to spousal maintenance under Idaho Code &sect; 32-705 for at least five years. However, the court concluded that the trial court did not make a specific finding concerning the amount awarded and that there was not substantial and competent evidence to support an implicit finding of need for the $ 1,700 awarded. Therefore, the court affirmed the award of spousal maintenance but vacated the amount awarded. The court also affirmed the award of attorney's fees to the wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment that awarded the wife spousal maintenance, but vacated the amount of the award and remanded the case to the trial court for consideration of the amount to be paid as spousal maintenance based on the wife's need as supported by evidence in the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant drove his pick-up truck into his wife's car, smashed her car window with a tire iron, and attacked her. He was convicted of aggravated battery on the first count and simple assault on the second count. The court vacated his conviction and remanded the matter for a new trial. The court found that the jury verdict was not inconsistent because the jury could have found that the tire iron was the instrumentality of the assault and either his vehicle or his hands were the instrumentality of the battery. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict of aggravated battery based upon appellant's use of his vehicle to strike the car which his wife was driving. The court held that the district court erred in permitting the jury to consider appellant's hands as deadly weapons in his attack upon his wife and vacated appellant's conviction. The court concluded that because the verdict did not specify whether the battery was committed by the use of appellant's hands or his vehicle, the cause had to be remanded for a new trial. The jury instructions as to the lesser included offenses were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, injured industrial workers (workers), attorneys, and others, sought an ex parte temporary stay and a peremptory writ of prohibition to prevent the Industrial Commission of the State of Idaho (Commission) from implementing regulations restricting the amount of legal fees recoverable by attorneys representing injured workers. The workers argued that the commission exceeded its authority and the regulations violated due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In promulgating the regulations, the Commission had a major concern that fees charged by claimants' attorneys in workers' compensation cases were unduly high. The court initially granted the petition for ex parte stay pending the court hearing. In denying the petition for a peremptory writ of prohibition, the court first determined that the authority granted to the Commission under Idaho Code &sect; 72-803, to &quot;approve&quot; attorney fees, did not conflict with the judicial penumbra affecting the practice of law. The regulation promulgated to foster ease, utility, and predictability in the application of &sect; 72-803, did not overstep the legislative bounds of &sect; 72-803, read in pari materia with the entire Workers' Compensation Act. The regulation restricting the amount of legal fees recoverable was not a fee schedule. It was a framework establishing uniform grounds for fee approval. The court then determined that the challenged regulation created no suspect or invidiously discriminatory classification, entangled no fundamental right, and did not restrain due process or equal protection under the United States or Idaho Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant had been a registered securities salesperson for several years. The department conducted an investigation of the applicant's conduct as a securities salesperson. The applicant discontinued his employment as a securities salesperson but later applied to become a registered salesperson in Idaho again. The department director issued an order and notice denying the applicant's registration. After a hearing requested by the applicant, a hearing officer submitted a proposed order denying the application. The applicant claimed that the denial of his application violated his right to due process of law. The court agreed and held that the notice to the applicant of the reasons for the denial prior to a hearing did not adequately notify the applicant of the reasons upon which the denial was based after a hearing. Furthermore, the provisions of Idaho Code &sect; 30-1413(7) referring to &quot;dishonest and unethical practices&quot; were unconstitutionally vague as applied to the applicant's conduct because the record did not indicate that the hearing officer possessed expertise born of personal knowledge and experience to enable the officer to determine whether the applicant acted unethically.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tribe challenged an order of the lower court (Idaho) that determined that a proposed amendment, which clarified the state's policy on gambling and specifically prohibited casino gambling within the state, Idaho Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Idaho Legislature introduced a constitutional amendment addressing the issue of gambling. Tribe filed a petition for an extraordinary writ of mandamus to prohibit the proposed amendment, which declared that gambling was strictly prohibited, from being presented on the election ballot. The electorate voted in favor of the amendment and tribe challenged the results, arguing that the amendment violated Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 20. The court disagreed, finding that the amendment's meaning and purpose was properly prepared by the legislature. The amendment was broader than merely concerning Indian gaming and the language was not misleading or deceptive. Further, the court found that the amendment was properly presented to the electorate. The court disagreed with tribe's argument that the amendment involved multiple subject matter, which should have been presented separately. The issue was not merely whether the matters in an amendment could be divided into separate questions, but whether the matters were incongruous and essentially unrelated. Although the provisions might be separable, they did not appear to be incongruous and essentially unrelated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was publicly critical of her supervisor. When a new supervisor was hired, she fired the employee. The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or new trial on the issue of liability because there was sufficient evidence to show that the housing authority breached the employment contract, that it was acting under color of state law for purposes of the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim, that the employee was terminated without due process of law, and that the employee's right to free speech was infringed. The court held that the trial court erred in allowing the jury to decide the legal component of the qualified immunity test as it applied to the executive director. As to damages, the court found that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on reputational damages on the &sect; 1983 claim. The court also found that the trial court did not engage in the proper analysis under Idaho R. Civ. P. 59(a)(5) as to the award of damages on the breach of contract and free speech claims.

The court affirmed, holding that under &sect; 19-2132(c), the jury was properly instructed that it could not consider a lesser-included offense unless it found defendant not guilty as to each of the greater offenses. The court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing a witness to testify as an expert on blood spatter evidence, and that it properly balanced the prejudicial and probative value of the evidence before admitting testimony that defendant sought to collect a drug debt from the murder victim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was initially charged with robbery and attempted first-degree murder in connection with a robbery and shooting of a store owner. Defendant was also charged with grand theft in connection with the theft of a gun on the day before the shooting. As part of a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree murder and the robbery and grand theft charges were dismissed. At sentencing, the trial court stated that while it had advised defendant prior to accepting his guilty plea that the maximum penalty for attempted first-degree murder was one-half of a life sentence, defendant had not been advised as to what that was in terms of years. The trial court then informed defendant what his sentence would be and offered defendant the opportunity to withdraw his plea. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court was authorized to establish a base maximum sentence upon the conviction of an attempt to commit a crime punishable by life imprisonment. Furthermore, defendant's sentence was within the statutory limits and was legal because the trial court fixed a base maximum sentence based on defendant's life expectancy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen's alliance submitted a proposed initiative regarding state law treatment of homosexuality to the attorney general. The proposed initiative prohibited affording homosexuals minority status. The attorney general was required to draft short and long titles for the initiative under &sect; 34-1809. Section 34-1809 required the short title to capture the distinctive nature of the initiative in a very limited number of words and the long title to convey the purpose of the measure. The attorney general drafted the titles. The ACLU filed a petition for a writ of prohibition, alleging that the titles were insufficient and unfair. The committee also filed a petition claiming that the long title could be understood to mean that the initiative gave special rights to minorities. The court certified the short and long titles as written. The court reasoned that the attorney general's short title was a true and impartial statement of the initiative and represented its distinctive characteristics. The court also explained that the long title expressed the purpose of the initiative without being argumentative or prejudicial even though there were other acceptable ways to write the title.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed pursuant to Idaho App. R. 11, and the court vacated defendant's conviction for attempted felony murder, holding that there was no such crime in Idaho. The sentences imposed were not excessive because defendant and his brother placed the lives of several people in danger, refused to surrender until a police officer was killed, and committed several other crimes in the process.  Idaho Code &sect; 19-2132 (1988) did not violate the right to a jury trial as guaranteed by Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 7; the jury still had to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crimes charged.

The overwhelming evidence demonstrated by any objective standard that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had the specific intent to kill the victim and that he committed the robbery with the specific intent to kill.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the county. The court determined that because the legislature did not state any role for local government units in regulating the retail sale of safe and sane fireworks, the legislature intended to preempt the regulation of retail sales of safe and sane fireworks. The court further found that the trial court incorrectly dismissed the owner's claim that the portion of the ordinance regarding the building requirements was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant common law husband challenged the decision of the District Court, Fifth Judicial District, Blaine County (Idaho), which entered judgment on a jury verdict in favor of appellee abused common law wife, who had shared home and intimate relations for over 10 years with her common law husband, and awarded a large sum of compensatory damages for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and $ 725,000 in punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A personal injury action was filed by the abused common law wife. The common law husband cross-claimed for collection of promissory note. The lower court entered judgment on jury verdict in favor of the wife, awarding her $ 50,000 in compensatory damages for battery, $ 225,000 for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and $ 725,000 in punitive damages, and the common law husband appealed. The court held that: 1. The claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress was a continuing tort for the purposes of the statute of limitations; 2. The evidence was sufficient to conclude that the common law husband's conduct toward the common law wife was beyond that which a reasonable person should be expected to tolerate or endure so as to a state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress; and 3. Remand was required due to the lower court's failure to adequately discuss findings necessary to rule on a motion for new trial based on the excessiveness of punitive damages where the lower court did not give any indication that it had a definite amount in mind when weighing the question of damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part the lower court's decision which entered judgment on a jury verdict in favor of the abused common law wife on the wife's intentional infliction of emotional distress and battery claims. The court vacated as to the motion for new trial on the issue of excessive damages and remanded for further findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, education association, school district and taxpayers, filed a suit against respondent State of Idaho alleging that the current system of funding public schools was unconstitutional because it did not provide a thorough education.

The court affirmed the district court's order dismissing the causes of action which alleged that the school funding system did not provide a uniform system of education and alleged a violation of the equal protection clause. The court held that judicial precedent mandated dismissal of appellants' uniformity and equal protection claims since a funding system which created unequal per student expenditures did not violate the constitution. The court reversed the dismissal of the causes of action alleging the funding system did not provide a thorough education and concluded appellants had alleged facts which, if proven at trial, would entitle them to relief. The order dismissing appellant taxpayers from the suit for lack of standing was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the use of defendant's co-conspirators' hearsay statements did not violate defendant's right to confrontation. The court reviewed the trial court's reasonable doubt jury instruction and determined that it did not deny defendant's right to due process. The court agreed with the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to have a jury impaneled for the purpose of sentencing because punishment in a capital case was to be determined by a judge rather than a jury. The court found that the trial court did not err in finding, based on a licensed psychologist's report, that there were no indications that defendant had any difficulty perceiving or understanding the proceedings against him. The court concluded that the victim's slow death at the hands of defendant and his co-conspirator was sufficient evidence of aggravating circumstances and his death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the Seventh Judicial District of the State of Idaho granted summary judgment, citing Idaho Code &sect; 6-904A(2), to respondent State of Idaho, Department of Health and Welfare (department) in the claim appellant, an elderly victim of a violent and sexual crime, brought seeking to impose vicarious liability for injuries sustained from an allegedly negligently managed juvenile in the care and custody of the department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was convicted of a crime against nature, rape, grand theft, and second-degree burglary, all perpetrated against the victim. The juvenile had no prior record involving sexual misconduct, violent aggression, or any felony. Evaluations revealed his angry nature and proclivity to aggression and the possibility of sexual crimes against his female peers. He was released to his parents, and the department lost touch with him shortly before the crimes. The court ruled that the evidence did not show the reckless, willful, and wanton conduct necessary for liability under &sect; 6-903, noting that nothing in the juvenile's antecedent behavior or present comportment presaged the vicious exploits committed against the victim such that a reasonable person could have foreseen the need to restrain him. The most drastic prediction recorded was that the juvenile might have been an above average sexual risk to his female peers, which the victim was not. The court noted that the Youth Rehabilitation Act, Idaho Code &sect; 16-1801, required the least restrictive setting necessary. Using the rational basis test, the court held the limitation of state liability in Idaho Code &sect; 6-904A constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment granted the department on the basis of governmental immunity in the suit the victim brought to hold it vicariously liable for the injuries she suffered from the criminal acts of a juvenile who was in the department's custody.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to entering his conditional plea of guilty, defendant brought a motion in limine that sought to prevent admission of two prior convictions for purposes of felony enhancement.

The court found that, at the hearing on his motion in limine, defendant did not present any evidence, but argued that, even though the state's documents showed that he waived his constitutional rights, the documents did not show that he did this knowingly and intelligently. The court found that, once the state made a prima facie showing of the validity of the prior convictions used to enhance a pending crime, defendant had the burden of going forward with proof that the convictions were defective because of the denial of some constitutional right. Because defendant failed to meet his burden of establishing that the prior convictions were defective, the court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion in limine and affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of driving under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the trial court's (Idaho) application of the Leon &quot;good faith&quot; exception to the exclusionary rule, which resulted in the admission of evidence obtained in violation of defendant's U.S. Const. amend. IV and Idaho Const. art. 1, &sect; 17 rights. Defendant also challenged the trial court's refusal to order the state to disclose the identity of a confidential informant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's residence was searched pursuant to a search warrant that, under the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; test, the lower court found improper since the magistrate did not have sufficient facts necessary before him to find probable cause. The lower court, however, ruled that under the Leon &quot;good faith&quot; exception to the exclusionary rule set forth by the United States Supreme Court, evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant should not be excluded. On appeal, the court rejected the &quot;good faith&quot; exception to the exclusionary rule. The court found that, unlike the federal exclusionary rule, the state exclusionary rule was created for a greater purpose than mere deterrence. It was created to protect the integrity of the warrant issuing process as a whole. Thus, the court ruled that Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 17 conferred broader protection than did U.S. Const. amend. IV and that the evidence against defendant should have been suppressed. The court also ruled that denial of review by the court carried no more weight than denial of certiorari by the United States Supreme Court, thus rejecting the Hays &quot;review denied&quot; rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order from the lower court, ruling that Idaho did not abide by the &quot;good faith&quot; exception to the exclusionary rule and that, thus, defendant's motion to suppress was improperly denied. The court also expressly disavowed the Hays &quot;review denied&quot; rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant, who applied for worker's compensation benefits, appealed an order of the Industrial Commission (Idaho), which determined that the claimant was entitled to benefits but denied claimant's post-hearing motions to amend his pleading. Appellee employer filed a cross-appeal from the Commission's findings that the claimant was an employee who was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after the injury, the claimant was placed on the payroll of another company in which the employer was a majority stockholder. In determining that the claimant was an employee of the employer, the Commission rejected the employer's claims that the claimant was either the other company's employee or an independent contractor. After the commission determined the employer's liability, the claimant moved for an order to change the caption of his complaint to include the alleged owners of the employer's business as defendants. The Commission denied the motion on the ground that it was made after liability was determined. In vacating the order in part on appeal, the court held that the Commission erred in denying the claimant's motion to change the caption because there was no time limitation on such motions under the Commission's rules of procedure and there was no evidence that the amendment would have prejudiced the owners. The court affirmed the order in part, finding substantial evidence to support the commission's findings that the claimant was the employer's employee because the employer exercised control over the time, manner, method, and details of the claimant's work.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order in part with regard to, among other things, the findings that the claimant was the employer's employee and that the employer was liable. The court vacated the order in part with regard to the denial of the claimant's motion to change the caption of his complaint. The case was remanded for a determination as to whether an amendment of the caption would have prejudiced the owners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner filed a petition for post-conviction relief after his conviction was affirmed on appeal. The petition asserted 17 causes of action as grounds for relief. The trial court denied the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order as to all issues except the prisoner's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on direct appeal. The court held that: (1) although the trial court erred when it applied Idaho Code &sect; 19-4901(b) retroactively, the error was harmless because the same result would have occurred; (2) the prisoner waived all of his claims except his constitutional claims and the claims of ineffective assistance at trial and on direct appeal; (3) the prisoner's claims, except for those of ineffective assistance of counsel, were meritless; and (4) the trial court erred in dismissing the prisoner's ineffective assistance of counsel claims without holding an evidentiary hearing because the record alone was insufficient to provide an adequate basis for determination of the claims.</SPAN></P>

At trial, the jury found that the architects had substantially performed under the contract, that the authority had breached the contract, and it awarded damages. The trial court granted a new trial confined to the issue of the architects' damages. The architects appealed, and the authority cross-appealed. The court remanded and held that (1) since the trial court did not discuss whether substantial evidence supported the jury's award of damages to architects, and only addressed the jury's finding of liability, it did not adequately address the authority's motion for a judgment n.o.v.; (2) on remand the trial court must clarify the rationale utilized in granting a new trial on the issue of damages; and (3) the trial court's refusal to give the authority's requested jury instructions was proper.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) admitting photographs of the victim laying on an autopsy table was not improper because such evidence in a homicide case could aid the jury as proof of the corpus delicti, the extent of injury, the condition of the body, and the degree and atrociousness of the crime; (2) excluding the pastor's testimony as to &quot;demonic possession&quot; or defendant's mental condition was not improper because a foundation had not been laid and the witness's expertise had not been established; and (3) denying defendant's motion for change of venue was not improper because defendant did not have difficulty selecting a jury, did not challenge any juror for cause, and did not show that pretrial publicity affected the jurors. The court also concluded that a justiciable controversy did not exist to support a ruling on whether Idaho Code &sect; 18-207(a), which eliminated the insanity defense, was unconstitutional because defendant failed to indicate that mental condition was an issue or to present evidence from the psychologist who examined defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the trial court's finding that the employee was in breach of the residency requirement was not clearly erroneous. A city residency rule was a continuing residency requirement, not a durational residency requirement; hence, it did not affect the fundamental right to travel and was not evaluated under a strict scrutiny standard. Applying the rational basis standard, the court held that the residency requirement did not violate the employee's equal protection rights. Although the employee was not immediately discharged upon the discovery of her residency violation, the court ruled that the delay did not give rise to equitable estoppel or waiver.

The court held that the victim impact statements contained in the presentence report were not error, and whereas the statements as to sentence were not considered by the trial judge in imposing the death penalty, there was no reversible error.

The court concluded that the language of the aggravating circumstance in &sect; 19-2515(g)(5) was not unconstitutionally vague. The court also held that the imposition of the death sentence was not influenced by passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary consideration and that the sentence was not disproportionate or excessive when compared to similar cases.

Further, the court held that plaintiffs were arrestees and remanded for the trial court to instruct whether the Fourth Amendment's &quot;objective reasonableness&quot; standard, balancing the nature and quality of the intrusion upon Fourth Amendment interests against the interests of the officers in treating plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant killed his father and was convicted of second-degree murder, he appealed from his sentence of life imprisonment, with 15 years fixed. The court affirmed. The sentence was not unreasonable. The sentence was not cruel and unusual punishment under either Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 6 or the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Reasonable minds might have differed as to whether a 15-year fixed term, or some lesser fixed term, was necessary to protect society from defendant. It was a reasonable view of the facts for the trial court to conclude that a 15-year fixed term was necessary to protect society. Under the circumstances, the court would not substitute its view of the appropriate term of confinement for the view of the trial court. The sentence was not out of all proportion to the gravity of the offense he committed, nor was it so severe as to shock the conscience of reasonable people. Defendant killed his father with a rifle. While some extenuating personal circumstances were involved, the murder was unprovoked and cruel. The sentence was not so disproportionate as to be cruel and unusual punishment under the eighth amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Idaho), which affirmed a judgment of conviction from the district court and its denial of defendant's motion to suppress certain evidence seized from his car when he was stopped at a roadblock. Defendant contended that the roadblock did not comply with Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 19-621, 19-622, and that the stop of his car and the ensuing investigation of his car were improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A roadblock was set up following a bank robbery. A police officer stationed prior to entry into the roadblock observed defendant leaning over the passenger side of his car and reaching under the seat, and the officer alerted the police stationed in the roadblock to stop defendant's vehicle because he appeared to be acting suspiciously. Defendant sought to suppress a baseball cap, a jacket, and a bag of money that were discovered in a search of his car at the roadblock. The court found that the police were allowed to set up the roadblock pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 19-621 because they were not unreasonable in suspecting that a bank robber, about whom they had a description, would escape by driving over the bridge where they set up the roadblock because it was the quickest route to the interstate highway. The stop of defendant's car was proper based on his movements as he approached the roadblock that were aptly characterized as suspicious. The ensuing investigation of his car to make a protective search for weapons was also proper based upon a reasonable belief that defendant might have had a bomb because the robber who was sought by police had threatened to use a bomb in the robbery.</SPAN></P>

The court found no error in the trial court's decision to allow a jailhouse informant to testify, noting that it was the jury's responsibility to weigh the credibility of his testimony. The court found that statements made by defendant to the police were voluntary. The court found no equal protection or due process violations in Idaho Code &sect; 19-2719, a statute providing for accelerated post-conviction proceedings.

The court also granted attorney fees to the city on the city's cross-claim alleging that the residents' action was frivolously brought. The residents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the ordinance, the city adopted an equity buy-in method of determining the amount of the connection fee by attempting to define the current value of the city's public water and sewer system and then apportioning a share of the value of that system to the new user. All revenue from the connection fee was placed in a separate special account and used only for replacement of existing system facilities and equipment. The residents argued that the ordinance violated the Idaho Revenue Bonding Act (act), Idaho Code &sect; 50-1027 through &sect; 50-1042. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's award of summary judgment to the city, but reversed the trial court's award of attorney fees to the city. The court held (1) that the fees were not taxes because they were not collected for general revenue-raising purposes and were specifically allocated in accordance with the act, and (2) that the fees were not arbitrary or unreasonable. As to the award of attorney fees, however, the court held that the residents' action was not brought frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation because, inter alia, it presented a novel question.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, concluding that because no facts supported use of the insanity defense, there was no justiciable controversy to support a ruling on the constitutionality of the repeal of the defense. Further, the trial court inquired into the juror's comment and properly determined that defendant was not prejudiced thereby. Additionally, the court found that the post-conviction process of Idaho Code &sect; 19-2719 did not violate due process rights, because it adequately ensured that death sentences were not carried out so as to arbitrarily deprive defendants of their lives, and successive petitions were allowed. Finally, although admitting victim impact statements of the murder victim's family was error, it was harmless error because the statements did not influence the imposition of sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld defendant's convictions and sentences for murder but vacated the sentence for the robbery conviction. The court ruled that (1) the testimony complained of was admissible because it was relevant to show defendant's intent and that the crimes were part of a common scheme; (2) the probative value of the testimony and of the photographs was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice; and (3) all of the elements required to sustain a conviction of robbery were also within the elements needed to sustain a conviction of felony murder, and the robbery conviction therefore merged with the felony murder conviction.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner Cowles Publishing Co. filed a petition for writ of mandamus for the purpose of determining the constitutionality of I.C. &sect; 19-811, and to mandate that the magistrate court open preliminary hearings to the public. An Alternate Writ of Mandate was issued by the Supreme Court of Idaho ordering Honorable Peter Hutchinson, Magistrate, First Judicial District Court, Kootenai County to hold a hearing or to show cause.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the underlying criminal proceeding, petitioner publishing company was denied access to the preliminary hearing. The publishing company sought a writ of mandamus to determine the constitutionality of Idaho Code &sect; 19-811, and to mandate that respondent magistrate court open this and all other preliminary hearings to the public. An alternate writ of mandate was issued by to the magistrate court to hold a hearing or to show cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The publishing company claimed that &sect; 19-811 infringed the free press provisions of U.S. Const. amend. I and the open court mandate of Idaho Const. art. 1, &sect; 18. The court rejected this claim and held that Idaho Code &sect; 19-811 did not violate either constitutional provision. However, the court granted the writ of mandate and ordered the magistrate court to conduct a hearing to determine the effect of public access to the preliminary hearing on the criminal defendant's fair trial rights and if there were alternatives to closure. The court found that the policy and traditional practice in Idaho was to open preliminary hearings and held that in Idaho, a qualified first amendment right of public access attached to preliminary hearings. However, the court also held that when a criminal defendant requested closure of a preliminary hearing pursuant to &sect; 19-811, the magistrate court was required to determine if there was a substantial probability that defendant's right to a fair trial would be prejudiced by publicity that closure would prevent. The magistrate was then required to determine if there were alternatives to closure that would protect defendant's fair trial rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction and sentence entered by the District Court of the Seventh Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Fremont County, for first degree murder and robbery, and the enhancement of the sentences for use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. Defendant argued that Idaho Code &sect; 18-207&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived him of his right to due process by forbidding him to plead an independent defense of insanity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial a jury found defendant guilty of murder in the first degree by finding both premeditation and by finding that defendant killed while committing a robbery. Defendant was also found guilty of robbery and of using a firearm while committing a felony. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that neither the federal nor the state constitutions contained any language setting forth any such to present an insanity defense as defendant argued. The court rejected the claim that the disallowance of the insanity defense under Idaho Code &sect; 18-207 deprived defendant of one of the fundamental principles of liberty and justice that were at the base of all civil and political institutions and thus denied him due process of law. Further, the court ruled that the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to strike a victim impact statement which was allegedly used as a basis for arriving at the sentence. The court did however vacate and remand the sentence imposed upon defendant in his absence in violation of Idaho Crim. R. 43(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction entered by the trial court, finding defendant guilty of first degree murder and robbery. The court also vacated the trial court order correcting the sentence imposed on defendant in his absence, and remanded the cause to the trial court for imposition of a valid sentence with the defendant present as required.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. As the statute of limitations in effect at the time of the commission of the acts with which defendant was charged had not run, the extension of that time by the legislature was not an ex post facto law. The court found that defendant pled guilty to violating &sect; 18-1506 upon the same facts alleged in the original information and the amended information. Violation of &sect; 18-1506 was a lesser included offense when an individual was charged with violations of Idaho Code &sect; 18-1508. Thus, the amended information did not violate provisions of Idaho Code &sect; 19-1420 or Idaho Cost. art. 1, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the Commission's order, concluding that substantial competent evidence supported the finding that the claimant was an independent contractor. The referee acknowledged the Commission's responsibility to liberally construe the facts in favor of the claimant, and found that the client never assumed the right to control the time, manner, and method of the claimant's work. Also, the claimant was compensated at a much higher rate than employees who did comparable work in the area, and the client's other workers were independent contractors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer operated a food business and contracted with independent contractors to market its products. Respondent department of employment held that the independent contractors were &quot;covered employees&quot; under Idaho Code &sect; 72-1316(d)(2). On appeal, the Industrial Commission upheld this determination. On further appeal, the court reversed the Commission's order. On rehearing, the court adhered to the views expressed in its original opinion. The court agreed with the employer's assertion that &sect; 72-1316(d)(2) denied the employer equal protection under both the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Idaho Const. art. 1, &sect; 2. The court found that &sect; 72-1316(d)(2) singled out independent contractors engaged in distributing meat, vegetables, fruit, bakery, or beverage products or conducting laundry or dry cleaning business from all others in the business of door-to-door marketing. The court found no legislative statement of policy or public purpose and no explanation or justification for the legislative distinction. The court concluded that it had correctly applied the rational basis test to &sect; 72-1316(d)(2) and found &sect; 72-1316(d)(2)&nbsp;unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court found that the statutes limited those eligible to serve on a jury to United States citizens who were able to read, speak, and understand the English language. Exclusion of Hispanics may have resulted from the application of those statutes, simply because the population of non-citizens and non-English speaking persons in Idaho was largely Hispanic.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the victim was attempting to repair his employer's hay baler's jammed pickup roller, an object struck him in the face causing retinal hemorrhaging and blindness in one eye. The victim brought suit against the manufacturers and his employer. The accident occurred almost 18 years after the hay baler was delivered to its first purchaser. The hay baler had been rebuilt at least twice with parts borrowed from other machinery. The victim did not establish how his injury occurred and offered no evidence to oppose the manufacturers' motion for summary judgment. The victim alleged Idaho's statute of repose was unconstitutionally vague and violated his rights to due process. The court held the statute of repose was constitutional, and the manufacturers were entitled to summary judgment. The victim failed to present any evidence that the baler's useful safe life had not expired. The statute met the rational basis test of having a reasonably conceived objective advancing the legitimate legislative goal of finality in legal relationships and establishing a maximum length of time the manufacturers were subject to liability. The language of the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from an order of the district court reversing a decision of the Idaho Horse Racing Commission on the ground that the rule upon which the Commission relied in imposing penalties on the trainers and owners of race horses was unconstitutionally vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Idaho Horse Racing Commission (Commission) sought review of a judgment from the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the County of Ada (Idaho), which reversed the Commission's decision that imposed penalties on respondents, race horse trainers and owners, and ordered the redistribution of purses. The trainers and the owners cross-appealed on the district court's denial of their request for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the horses had placed in races, urine samples revealed that they had polyethylene glycol in their systems. Respondents received notices that violations of Commission's Rule 725, which prohibited the administration of &quot;non-approved&quot; medications to race horses, had occurred. The Commission fined the trainers and ordered that the owners' purses were to be redistributed. The court reversed the district court decision that reversed the Commission's determination that imposed penalties on the trainers because Rule 725 was not unconstitutionally vague. Rule 725 was a substantive, prohibitory rule and the term &quot;non-approved medication&quot; was sufficiently explained by Rules 716 and 725. Rule 2802 provided that the trainers were responsible for the condition of the horses. The court affirmed the portion of the district court's judgment that reversed the Commission's order to redistribute the purses because Rule 725 did not include a penalty provision. The owners were entitled to attorney fees pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 117(1) because the Commission had no authority to order the redistribution of the purses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Commission's action for the administration of &quot;non-approved&quot; medications to race horses, the court affirmed the district court's denial of the trainers' motion for attorney fees and the district court's reversal of the Commission's order that ordered the redistribution of the purses. The court reversed the district court's order that reversed the Commission's imposition of penalties on the trainers.</SPAN></P>

The patient filed a complaint alleging that the doctors were negligent for not diagnosing the tumor.

The court reversed the statute of limitations issue, but affirmed the ruling that the &sect; 5-219(4) was constitutional.

</DIV>

After the board issued thousands of permits, the state legislature adopted HCR-29, rescinding the new rules and instructing the board to promulgate the rules that were in effect prior to the adoption of the new rules. Although the board refused to follow this mandate, the district health department complied. The board brought an action to declare HCR-29 and its governing statute,&nbsp;Idaho Code &sect; 67-5218, unconstitutional. The court refused to hold &sect; 67-5218&nbsp;unconstitutional, finding it promulgated properly and holding that the legislature could rescind the rules if the proper method was followed. However, the court held HCR-29 of no effect due to the legislature's failure to declare the new rules violative of the legislative intent in the enabling statute. Thus, a writ of mandate was issued against the district health department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to his conviction for statutory rape, defendant appealed. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's ruling that it was not a defense to a charge of statutory rape that defendant reasonably believed that the female with whom he had intercourse was at least 18 years old. On further appeal, the court affirmed. Since the prevention of illegitimate teenage pregnancies was cited as one of the objectives behind Idaho Code &sect; 18-6101(1) (1987), and the state's strong interest in furthering this objective was noted, the court was unable to conclude that statutory rape should be construed to require proof of any specific intent. Examples within the design of the statute indicated to the court that the legislature understood the distinction between general criminal intent and specific criminal intent and chose not to require specific criminal intent to convict of a violation of Idaho Code &sect; 18-6101(1) (1987). If the court accepted the applicability of the defense, it would have had to conclude that statutory rape was a crime requiring proof of specific intent to have intercourse with a female under the age of eighteen years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The skier was severely injured when he struck a signpost after an unidentified skier collided with him. A member of the ski patrol who administered first aid to the skier permitted the unidentified skier to leave the scene without requiring him to identify himself. Plaintiffs filed an action against the operator to recover damages for the skier's injuries. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the operator. On appeal, the court affirmed. Even assuming that the operator might not have properly located the sign or properly designed, constructed or padded the signpost, Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 6-1101 through 6-1109 excluded any liability caused by those activities. The responsibility for the collision between the skier and the unidentified skier was theirs and not the operator's. The unidentified skier had the duty to identify himself following the accident. The operator's only duty was to provide a ski patrol with qualifications meeting the standards of the national ski patrol. Because there was no evidence that the operator failed to follow the duty set forth in Idaho Code &sect; 6-1103(8), it was not liable for the failure to determine the identity of the unidentified skier.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent department of employment declared that certain independent contractors that assisted the employer were covered employees, thus, the employer was required to pay unemployment compensation tax. The Industrial Commission upheld this determination, and the employer challenged the decision on the ground that Idaho Code &sect; 72-1316 violated the equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Idaho Const. art. 1, &sect; 2. The court noted that an act of the legislature was presumed constitutional, but whether the act was reasonable, or arbitrary, or discriminatory was a question of law. In addition, a classification for tax purposes was reviewed on the rational basis test. After an independent analysis to ascertain a legitimate basis for what on its face was a discriminatory tax, the court found no such rational basis. The court found the particular provisions of &sect; 72-1316 to be unconstitutional on its face, and as applied, because it denied the employer equal protection of the laws in violation of the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Idaho State Tax Commission sought review of a judgment of a district court (Idaho), which affirmed a decision in favor of respondent taxpayer, in an action where the taxpayer challenged an appraisal-assessment made to its property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission originally appraised the property owned by the taxpayer for ad valorem tax purposes. That appraisal-assessment was appealed, and a decision in favor of the taxpayer was entered. The district court affirmed the decision in favor of the taxpayer, and the Commission appealed. On appeal, the sole question presented was whether the Commission erred in refusing to apply a formula of its own property tax regulation. The formula prescribed by the regulation included all of the property involved in the dispute. The court held that there was nothing unconstitutional or invalid about the regulation. The Commission could not be permitted to ignore its own regulation. On cross-appeal, the taxpayer argued that the Commission incorrectly determined the value of the property. The court concluded that the valuation was proper, but that the taxpayer was entitled to interest on the amount of tax paid by it that was refunded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of the taxpayer's request for interest, and affirmed the judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

The district court (Idaho) dismissed the case for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The ratepayer sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ratepayer claimed that the controversy was justiciable because it did not involve a political question, he had standing, and it was ripe for adjudication. He also claimed that the implementing legislation violated the equal protection and the due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the claim was justiciable, but rejected the other arguments, and affirmed the lower court's dismissal. The court held that the claim regarding the constitutionality of the implementing legislation was not an impermissible political question and that the ratepayer had standing because he had a personal stake in the outcome of the case. The court further held that the case was ripe because deferral to the PUC's administrative procedures would not add anything material to the resolution of the legal issues. However, the court held that the legislation was constitutional. The court held that the ratepayer did not have a protected property interest within the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the legislation substantially furthered a specifically identifiable legislative end and thus did not violate the equal protection provisions of this amendment.</SPAN></P>

The Commission found that the attorney exhibited an inclination to violate reasonable rules of conduct and that he failed to exercise substantial self-control which met the standard for disqualification set forth in Idaho Bar Comm'n R. 208(e)(7), (8). On review, the court remanded the matter to the Commission with instructions that the Commission make findings of fact stating particularly what acts or omissions of the attorney made him unfit to practice law in Idaho. The court found that the Commission's failure to make findings of fact deprived the attorney of his right to due process of law. The court noted that the attorney's interest in practicing law in Idaho was a substantial interest and that the administrative cost of making findings of fact would have been minimal. The court concluded that the Commission had a duty to formulate findings of fact and conclusions of law so that a reviewing court could have a basis to conduct meaningful review. The court noted that there would have been no ancillary disruptive effect on the administrative efficiency of the Commission.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court determined that the state did not deprive appellant of due process by failing to preserve the semen samples it had obtained. The court held that the circumstantial evidence presented, and from which the jury clearly drew the inference of appellant's guilt, was sufficient to sustain a conviction. The court concluded that although the evidence against appellant was circumstantial, it was nonetheless significant and weighty. However, because the trial court incorrectly weighed all of the mitigating circumstances against all of the aggravating circumstances, collectively, rather than individually, the court vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Second, a claimant must show that this deficient performance prejudiced his or her case. Here, while defendant's testimony at the motion to dismiss hearing may have been unwise, it was a strategic decision by counsel that could not be second-guessed. Evidence of grand theft and kidnapping were properly admitted against defendant, despite the fact that those charges were dropped, because they tended to show his motive or intent. Idaho R.

Pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 31-44 the county commissioners ordered the establishment of a solid waste disposal system whereby the county would have the responsibility for providing for all solid waste disposal including landfill sites. On appeal, the court concluded that the solid waste disposal fee for residential dwellings was reasonably related to the services rendered by the county in acquiring, establishing, maintaining, and operating its solid waste disposal system. The court held that the fee was authorized by Idaho Code &sect; 31-4402(2) and was not an illegal tax in violation of the Idaho Const. art. 7, &sect;&sect;4, 5. The court held that the commissioners' choice to set the commercial unit charge according to actual use did not negate the reasonableness of not also using the approach for residential dwellings. The court pointed out that the county was authorized to enact either a solid waste disposal tax or a solid waste disposal fee.</SPAN></P>

After the court held that the railroad employees were not subject to income taxation, the commission filed a petition for rehearing. In denying the petition, the court reaffirmed its holding that the railroad employees were not subject to state income tax because there was not a substantial nexus between the railroad employees and the taxing authority. The court rejected the commission's contention that only multi-state corporations were entitled to the protection of the nexus requirement. Moreover, the mere fact that the railroad employees traveled through the state did not create a substantial nexus because presence alone was insufficient. The railroad employees were entitled to the protection of the commerce clause because they worked across state boundaries and were involved in interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Idaho State Tax Commission petitioned for rehearing. The court had rendered an original opinion, finding that the Idaho Income Tax Act, by imposing a tax on the income of train crew on through trains, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Commerce Clause. The commission challenged the earlier judgment from the District Court of the First Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Kootenai County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission argued that the concept of nexus should not be applied in the same fashion to multi-state corporations and to nonresident individuals. The commission maintained that the court erred in looking to principles of nexus developed in cases dealing with multi-state corporations in determining whether a sufficient nexus existed in the case to justify the imposition of income taxes on the train crews. The contention suggested that individuals were not entitled to the same protection of the nexus requirement as corporations were under the due process clause and the commerce clause. The commission argued that while the train crews were working in Idaho they were receiving the benefits of Idaho's organized society and should therefore be subject to Idaho income taxes. The court re-iterated that the relationship of the train crews was with their employer, not with Idaho. The fact that they were paid for duties they performed on the trains while the trains were traveling through Idaho did not amount to their benefiting from the fruits of civilization in Idaho. Idaho did not provide them with the opportunity for employment; only their employer provided them with that opportunity.</SPAN></P>

The MA gave consent to sue the United States in any suits for the adjudication of the rights to the use of water of river systems or other sources. At issue was the inclusion by the trial court of the Boise River and Weiser River sub-basins in defining the boundaries of the water system to be adjudicated. The court held that Idaho Code &sect; 42-1406A(3)(b) did not require the special consent of the United States external to the MA for the exclusion of those sub-basins from the adjudication, however, the court ruled that the inclusion of those sub-basins was required to obtain jurisdiction over the United States under the MA. The court ruled that the legislative history of &sect; 42-1406A(3)(b) showed that by the words &quot;any adjudicated tributary&quot; the legislature intended to refer to the Boise, Payette, Weiser, and Lemhi rivers.</SPAN></P>

When defendant filed his petition for post-conviction relief and his motion for a reduced sentence, he sought to disqualify the trial judge. The district court denied all of the relief requested by defendant in the petition and motions. The court affirmed the judgments. Because the issues raised in the post conviction relief petition were adjudicated on direct appeal, there was no error in the district court's res judicata ruling in denying the petition. The new cases cited by defendant in support of his claim that his sixth amendment right to counsel was violated did not apply. When faced with a motion to disqualify in post conviction proceedings, the trial judge was required only to have concluded that he could properly perform the legal analysis that the law required. The determination that it was necessary to reduce the interminable delay in capital cases was a rational basis for the imposition of the 42-day time limit for post-conviction relief petitions set forth in Idaho Code &sect; 19-2719.</SPAN></P>

The wife, who was also injured in the crash, commenced an action for wrongful death and for her own injuries against several parties including the driver, her estate, the hotel, and its employees. The trial court dismissed the wife's claims against the hotel and its employees on the ground that Idaho did not recognize dram shop liability at the time of the accident. The wife appealed from that order, which was reversed. The matter was remanded. The dram shop and social host liability act, Idaho Code &sect; 23-808, was not applicable because the accident occurred before its effective date. However, prior to the enactment of &sect; 23-808, a cause of action existed when a purveyor of spirits continued to serve an obviously intoxicated person who was under the legal drinking age. The court concluded that there was no reason to distinguish between a minor and an adult when either was obviously intoxicated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the bank's foreclosure action, the lender filed a separate action against the bank, alleging causes of action grounded both in law and equity. The district court consolidated the cases and denominated the lender's claim a compulsory counterclaim pursuant to Idaho R. Civ. Proc. 13(a). The district court then granted the bank's motion to strike the borrower's demand for a jury trial. On appeal, the court reversed. The court noted that a party's right to jury trial was &quot;inviolate&quot; pursuant to Idaho Const. art. 1, &sect;7, and that Idaho R. Civ. Proc. 13(a) would be unconstitutional if it compelled a party either to waive his right to a jury by pleading the counterclaim or waive the claim by not pleading it. The court held that a party to an equity action had a right to jury trial on legal causes of action asserted in his compulsory counterclaim, unless there was a clear showing of &quot;imperative circumstances&quot; which would cause the equity claimant irreparable harm while affording a jury trial in the legal cause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court considered whether the county commissioners had the authority to institute a merit system binding county officers, particularly the sheriff, under which such officers could not terminate deputies and other employees in their department except for cause. In response, the court first held that the board of county commissioners had been granted authority by the Idaho legislature to establish a merit system binding the sheriff. The court determined that such an act was a valid exercise of the legislature's express power. Secondly, the court determined that the merit system at issue did not abridge the sheriff's constitutional right to appoint deputies. The court held that fundamental to its decision was the fact that the Idaho Constitution addressed only the right of the sheriff to appoint deputies, not a right to discharge them at will. Thus, the court held that a sheriff's constitutional right to appoint deputies was not abridged where county commissioners instituted a merit system prohibiting the dismissal of deputies without cause, so long as the merit system was reasonable under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was incarcerated in a prison. He was thereafter confined to 30 days in disciplinary detention for possessing a homemade knife. The prison had a policy at that time, which did not allow an inmate physical access to the law library for the first 10 days of detention. The inmate pursued a habeas corpus proceeding in which he challenged the restriction. The magistrate denied the writ, and, on appeal, the district court reversed the magistrate's order and declared the restriction unconstitutional. On the state's appeal, the court affirmed the district court's judgment. The fundamental constitutional right of access to the courts required the prison authorities to provide the inmate access to the law library. Moreover, the fact that the court could not grant affirmative relief to the inmate due to his subsequent access to the courts did not prevent the court from granting the writ because the restriction was unconstitutional on its face. The restriction was subject to strict scrutiny, and the state failed to demonstrate any compelling penological interest that was served by the restriction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, appellant firefighters sought review of the decision of the Industrial Commission of the State of Idaho (commission), which upheld an order of respondent, the State of Idaho (state) Public Employee Retirement System Board (board), requiring that disability retirement benefits be offset by prior worker's compensation benefits. The state cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firefighters negotiated lump sum monetary worker's compensation settlements for work-related injuries. After their involuntary retirements, the firefighters sought disability retirement benefits. The board granted the benefits but offset the amount of the lump sum worker's compensation benefit. The commission affirmed the setoff. Both parties appealed. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that retirement benefits under the Firemen's Retirement Fund (FRF) were deferred compensation and that requiring the firefighters to contribute to the cost of their worker's compensation benefits violated Idaho Code &sect; 72-318. Further, offsetting under the FRF impaired the constitutional right to contract because the altered interpretation of Idaho Code &sect; 72-1414 materially changed the firefighters' contractual expectations regarding their vested rights to receive FRF retirement benefits. Moreover, &sect; 72-1414 was violative of equal protection of the law because the statute arbitrarily classified voluntary and involuntary retirees and membership in the FRF versus board systems. Finally, because the offset provisions of &sect; 72-1414 were unconstitutional, the state's cross-appeal was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision that was in favor of the state requiring that disability retirement benefits be offset by prior worker's compensation benefits.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the District Court of the Third Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Canyon County, which denied his petition for post conviction relief from his death sentence, his motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to Idaho Crim. R. 35, and his motion to disqualify the original trial judge from sitting in the post conviction and sentence reduction proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's conviction for murder and his death sentence were affirmed on appeal, he filed a petition for post-conviction relief, and motions for a sentence reduction and disqualification of the original trial judge. The trial court denied the petition and the motions, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that while many of the issues raised by defendant in the petition were barred by res judicata, others were appealable. Idaho Code &sect; 19-2719, which set a 42 day limit on filing of a death sentence challenge, did not violate the equal protection clause because it had a rational basis in the legislative goal to prevent unnecessary delays in capital cases. The trial judge's refusal to disqualify himself was proper because Idaho Crim. R. 35 directed that post-conviction proceedings be heard by the trial court that rendered the original sentence. Although the trial judge had strong opinions regarding defendant, that did not constitute prejudice or bias that would require disqualification. Finally, defendant's death sentence was imposed within the statutory limits of his crime, and it was in proportion to similar sentences within a broad spectrum of murder cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Ada County, which denied his motion to suppress evidence and convicted him of driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Defendant contended that the roadblock at which he was stopped and arrested was an unreasonable search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped at a police roadblock designed to detect and deter drunk driving and was subsequently arrested for DUI. At trial, defendant submitted a motion to suppress all evidence of his intoxicated condition obtained during the stop, on the basis that the evidence resulted from an unlawful seizure. Following a denial of that motion by the magistrate, defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty. The district court, acting in an appellate capacity, affirmed the magistrate's judgment and sentence. On appeal, the court reversed and held that where police lacked express legislative authority, particularized suspicion of criminal wrongdoing, and prior judicial approval, roadblocks established to apprehend drunk drivers could not withstand scrutiny under Idaho Const. art. 1, &sect; 17. In so holding, the court noted that although the government interest in reducing alcohol-related accidents was great, that end was not necessarily best served by a warrantless roadblock search, which yielded fewer DUI arrests than did the usual procedure, which first detected criminal wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that because the evidence used to convict defendant was unconstitutionally obtained pursuant to a warrantless search, prior to which the police lacked individualized suspicion of criminal wrongdoing and authority to establish a roadblock, the magistrate and trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress. Accordingly, defendant's DUI conviction was reversed. No costs were assessed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

III, &sect; 20, which prohibited the legislature from authorizing a lottery or gift enterprise also prohibited the electorate from enacting a lottery through the initiative process. The court rejected defendants' argument that only the legislature was prohibited from authorizing a lottery where the Idaho Constitution read as a whole indicated that the purpose behind art. III, &sect; 20 was to prohibit the authorization of a lottery. In addition, the court found that there was nothing in the legislative initiative provision, Idaho Const. art.

I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The railway employees' wages while traveling through the state were not attributable to any economic activity within the state and that neither the state's markets or its commerce affected the railway employees' income in any degree. They were present in the state because the trains on which they were employed necessarily traversed the panhandle of the state while traveling to their ultimate destinations. The state did not give anything to the railway employees for which it could ask a return and the mere presence of the railway employees in the state did not provide the nexus necessary to allow the income tax to be imposed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the controversy was justiciable, rejecting respondents' arguments regarding the political question, standing, and ripeness doctrines. The court concluded that the implementing legislation did not violate the due process guarantees of the federal or state constitutions. The court rejected the ratepayer's assertion that he had a due process property interest in the rates paid for electricity. The court also held that the right to equal protection was not violated because the legislation was substantially related to the objective of settling adverse claims to water. Finally, the state constitution's prohibition against certain types of special legislation was not offended.</SPAN></P>

The district court entered partial summary judgment in favor of the garbage service determining that the city had taken the property without just compensation and awarded just compensation with interest from the dates of taking. On appeal, the court held that if the city had merely regulated the operation of the garbage service in the annexed areas by requiring it to comply with reasonable standards established by the city, there would have been no taking, but it chose to take from the garbage service any opportunity to service its customers in the annexed areas. The court held that this exclusion entitled the garbage service to just compensation, with interest, and affirmed the district court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

As a result, the appraised value of each unit increased drastically. The Board and Commissioners upheld the Assessor's property tax evaluation. The company filed a complaint for review of these decisions, and the lower court granted summary judgment to the county, Commissioners, Assessor, and Treasurer. The court affirmed in part the judgment, holding that the classification of the complex as a condominium was constitutionally valid because the filing of the Declaration triggered the new classification, pursuant to the Condominium Property Act, Idaho Code &sect; 55-1501 et seq. The judgment was reversed in part because the trial court failed to address the issue of whether the county's assessment scheme considered the complex' &quot;actual and functional use,&quot; as required by Idaho Code &sect; 63-202.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and held that the district court was without jurisdiction to affirm the disciplinary order imposed by the Board after having initially ordered a remand, from which order the engineers perfected their appeal.

While defendant stood by armed with a shotgun, his brother crushed the victims' skulls with a nightstick. Rejecting defendant's defense theory that he was only an accessory after the fact, the jury convicted him of two counts of first-degree murder committed during the course of a robbery. Although defendant agreed to testify against his brother, the trial court nonetheless sentenced him to death. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that defendant's assignments of error either lacked merit or were not preserved for review. Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant and there were no significant errors in the sentencing procedure. Furthermore, the trial court properly denied defendant's petition for post-conviction relief.

The claimant brought the action on behalf of himself and as guardian ad litem for his three minor children. The claimant appealed the judgment of the District Court of the Seventh Judicial District (Idaho), which dismissed the claim on behalf of the children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant challenged the trial court's decision finding that the children were not proper parties in the action. On appeal, the court held that because the entire estate of the deceased spouse was community property, the surviving spouse was the only proper party plaintiff in the action. The court stated that Idaho Code &sect; 5-311 (1980) provided that a decedent's heirs or personal representatives were permitted to bring an action for damages against the person whose wrongful act or neglect caused the decedent's death. The court found that the statutory term &quot;heirs&quot; was determined by reference to the statutes of descent and distribution in effect at the time of the decedent's death. Under Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 15-2-102 and 15-2-103, children were not considered heirs unless the decedent had left separate property with a value in excess of $ 50,000. The court found that this interpretation of the wrongful death statute was supported by legislative history. The court also found that the limitation on the number of persons who may bring a wrongful death action was not violative of the equal protection provisions in the Idaho and United States constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the Department in its audit used only Medicare Part A charges to determine the reimbursement and did not use Part B charges. The hospital argued that Part B charges should have been used and that the regulations were so vague that it was unclear that the reimbursement rate was limited to Part A charges. The court held that 42 C.F.R. &sect; 450.30 clearly provided that the Medicare reimbursement rate was limited to Part A and was not void for vagueness. The Provider Reimbursement Manual regulations expressly excluded ancillary services from the calculation of Medicare Part A and to include the ancillary charges would have impermissibly inflated the reimbursement rate by permitting the hospital a double recovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the system used in Idaho of allowing the prosecutor unfettered discretion to initiate criminal proceedings by indictment or information without regard to any systematic or coherent policy violated his right to equal protection. The court, however, held that a prosecutor could proceed by either alternative, indictment or information. The court further held that where legally sufficient evidence would sustain an indictment, improperly admitted hearsay evidence would not overturn the grand jury's indictment. Furthermore, the prosecutor's allegedly improper comments regarding the credibility of witnesses and the weight and sufficiency of the evidence did not warrant a reversal when the record failed to indicate that prosecutor's comments infringed on the grand jury's decision-making function. Moreover, the unauthorized presence of a deputy clerk and an attorney before the grand jury did not necessitate a reversal when defendant failed to show that their presence prejudiced the independence and secrecy of the grand jury proceedings. The court concluded by noting that while there were some errors in the proceedings, none rose to a level requiring dismissal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal granting the defendant-respondent State Tax Commission and 20 Idaho counties summary judgment on their cross-motion for summary judgment and denying the cross-motion for summary judgment of plaintiffs-appellants V-1 Oil Company, Weathertite Block Company, Six B, Inc., S.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sought review of a decision of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Ada County, which granted summary judgment in favor of respondents, the Idaho State Tax Commission and 20 Idaho counties, in the taxpayers' action seeking a declaratory judgment that the procedures of certain counties in accumulating budget surpluses were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court granted partial summary judgment determining that taxpayers' properties were taxable, the parties settled questions regarding valuation, taxes and penalties. The settlement agreement reserved to the taxpayers the right to litigate two issues: (1) whether the counties must take surpluses into account when establishing current budgets so as not to impose excessive levies, and (2) whether tax rates as between real and personal property as between the counties must be uniform. The parties stipulated that the two issues could be determined by cross-motions for summary judgment without trial. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the State and the counties. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that summary judgment was proper. Even though the trial court found the taxpayers' facts as alleged to be true, those facts only indicated that the counties had surpluses for the years in question. There was no showing as to whether the counties considered the surpluses in the following year's budget process. The court also held that Idaho Code &sect; 31-1605A was constitutional because it was designed to carry out the intent of Idaho Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 15 and 16.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife consulted with an attorney concerning a divorce and the wife's attorney drafted a property settlement and separation agreement. The husband and wife signed the agreement and the wife filed an action for divorce and prayed that the trial court approve the property settlement and separation agreement. The husband defaulted and the trial court entered a decree of divorce and approved the parties' agreement. Thereafter, the wife filed a petition to modify and vacate the divorce decree and sought one half interest in the husband's military retirement pay. The husband filed a motion to dismiss the wife's motion and the trial court granted the husband's motion. The wife appealed and the court affirmed the trial court's order and held that a divorce decree was final, res judicata, and no jurisdiction existed to modify the property provisions. Enactment of the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act, 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1408, did not provide justification for modification of the decree. Further, relief under Idaho R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4) or 60(b)(5) was unavailing because the decree was not void, no mistake was claimed, and the decree was not prospective or inequitable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver sought review of the judgment of the District Court of the Seventh Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Bonneville County, which denied appellant's motion for a jury trial after appellant was accused of disobeying an official traffic control device in violation of Idaho Code &sect; 49-611(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver challenged the constitutionality of the Idaho Traffic Infractions Act (ITIA), Idaho Code &sect; 49-3401, and the denial of his right to a jury trial pursuant to Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 7, following a magistrate's ruling that appellant was guilty of disobeying a traffic control device in violation of Idaho Code &sect; 49-611(1). Appellant argued that Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 7 guaranteed him a jury trial and that although the ITIA defined infractions as civil public offenses for purposes of constitutional analysis, the infraction was criminal. The court affirmed, holding that the ITIA was not unconstitutional. The court held that Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 7 guaranteed a jury trial whenever the possible sanction included imprisonment and that the infraction of which appellant was accused was not punishable in this manner. The court held that even if appellant refused to pay the fine imposed, the worst he would suffer was the suspension of his license. The court held that the sanction imposed, a fine not exceeding $ 100, did not rise to the level of a punitive, criminal sanction rather it was remedial in nature and served as a form of damages for the state's enforcement costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of appellant driver's motion for a jury trial. The court held that although the prosecutions of all public offenses were criminal actions, it was not unconstitutional to preclude a trial by jury so long as the offense charged was not punishable by imprisonment or other criminal sanction.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that &sect; 36-1604 provided limited liability to landowners who gratuitously allowed others to use the land, or equipment attached to or used on the land, for recreational purposes. The court found that the city was an &quot;owner&quot; within the meaning of the statute, found that the park was &quot;public land&quot; within the meaning of the statute, and ruled that the statute applied to public entities. The court also ruled that the operation of a city park was for &quot;recreational purposes&quot; within the meaning of the statute and that use of a park swing was a &quot;recreational purpose&quot; within the meaning of the statute. The court said that although the statute listed several activities in the definition of &quot;recreational purposes,&quot; the statute expressly provided that the list was not exhaustive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Idaho State Tax Commission sought review of a decision of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Ada County (Idaho), which held that respondent advertiser's newspaper inserts were not subject to the use tax. The trial court held that the inserts fell within the production exemption of Idaho Code &sect; 63-3622(d) and that the sales tax regulation interpreting the applicable statutes violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The advertiser's out-of-state printer shipped advertising inserts to newspapers selected by the advertiser. Through contracts with the newspapers, the advertiser designated the number of inserts to be distributed as well as the date of distribution. The court determined that the advertiser was subject to use tax on the inserts under Idaho Code &sect; 63-3621 because the advertiser owned the inserts until it gave them away to newspaper purchasers and it exercised such control of the inserts under its contracts with newspapers to constitute &quot;use&quot; of the inserts within the meaning of Idaho Code &sect; 63-3615(b). The court also found that the advertiser did not qualify for the production exemption under Idaho Code &sect; 63-3622(d) because it was primarily devoted to retailing, not manufacturing, processing, mining, farming, or fabricating. The court concluded that the advertiser was liable for the use tax even if the tax regulations interpreting the use tax statutes were unconstitutional. The advertiser owed tax under a statutory scheme that was constitutional, and assessment of the use tax pursuant to a regulation that did not comport with the constitution did not defeat its statutory liability.</SPAN></P>
